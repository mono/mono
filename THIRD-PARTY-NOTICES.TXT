 * This implements standard-conforming allocators that interact with
 * the garbage collector.  Gc_alloctor<T> allocates garbage-collectable
 * objects of type T.  Traceable_allocator<T> allocates objects that
 * are not temselves garbage collected, but are scanned by the
 * collector for pointers to collectable objects.  Traceable_alloc
 * should be used for explicitly managed STL containers that may
 * point to collectable objects.
 *
 * This code was derived from an earlier version of the GNU C++ standard
 * library, which itself was derived from the SGI STL implementation.
