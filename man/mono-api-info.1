.SH DESCRIPTION
Expose the structure of your CLR assemblies by examining their IL and
giving XML output.

By default this tool gives information about just the public API of the
assemblies to scan. So it's good for comparing API compatibility between
versions of libraries.

Show the ABI instead of the API, that is, non-static fields (even the
non-public ones) that are not marked as [NonSerialized()].
