The mono JIT can use an IMT-style invocation system to call interface methods.
This considerably reduces the runtime memory usage when many interface types
are loaded, because the old system required an array in MonoVTable indexed
by the interface id, which grows linearly as more interfaces are loaded.

IMT instead uses a fixed-size table and hashes each method in the implemented
interfaces to a slot in the IMT table. To be able to resolve collisions, at each
callsite we store the interface MonoMethod in a well-known register and the
IMT table will contain a snippet of code that uses it to jump to the
proper vtable slot. The interface invocation sequence becomes (in pseud-ocode):

	mov magic_reg, interface_monomethod
	call vtable [imt_slot]

The IMT table is stored at negative addresses in the vtable, like the old
interface array used to be.

In case of collisions in the IMT slot, the JIT performs a linear search if
the colliding methods are few or a binary search otherwise.
To make this easier for each JIT port, a sort of internal representation
of the code is created: this is an array of MonoIMTCheckItem structures
built in a way to allow easy generation of a bsearch, when the list of colliding
methods becomes large.

Each item in the array represents either a direct check for a method to be invoked
or a bisection check in the bsearch algorithm.

struct _MonoIMTCheckItem {
	MonoMethod       *method;
	int               check_target_idx;
	int               vtable_slot;
	guint8           *jmp_code;
	guint8           *code_target;
	guint8            is_equals;
	guint8            compare_done;
	guint8            chunk_size;
	guint8            short_branch;
};

For a direct check, the is_equals value is non-zero and the emitted code
should be equivalent to:
	if (magic_reg != item->method)
		jump_to_item (array [item->check_target_idx]);
	jump_to_vtable (item->vtable_slot);

Note that if item->check_target_idx is 0, the jump should be omitted
since this is the end of a linear sequence (you might want to insert a jump to
a breakpoint, though, for debugging).

For a bisect check the code is even simpler:

	if (magic_reg >= item->method)
		jump_to_item (array [item->check_target_idx]);

In this case item->check_target_idx is always non-zero.
Note that in both cases item->method becomes an immediate constant in the
jitted code.

The other fields in the structure are there to provide to the backend
common storage for data needed during emission.
As each item's code is emitted, the start of it is stored in the code_target
field. At the same time when a conditional branch is inserted, its address
is stored in jmp_code: this way with a single forward pass on the array at
the end of the emission phase the branches can be patched to point to the
proper target item's code.

chunk_size can be used to store the size of the code generated for the item: this
can be used to optimize the short/long branch instructions, together with
info stored in short_branch.

The compare_done field can be used to avoid doing an additional compare
in a is_equals item for the same MonoMethod that was just compare in a
bisecting item. Suppose we have 4 methods colliding in a slot, A, B, C and D.
The generated code will look like (M is the method to call):

	compare (C, M)
	goto upper_sequence if bigger_equals
	/* linear sequence */
	compare (M, A)
	goto B_found if not_equals
	jump to A's slot
B_found:
	jump to B's slot

upper_sequence:
	/* we just did a compare against C, no need to compare again */
	goto D_found if not_equals
	jump to C's slot
D_found:
	jump to D's slot

This optimization is of course valid for architectures with flags registers.

As a further optimization to reduce memory usage, the Mono runtime sets the
IMT slots initially to a single-instance magic trampoline so there is actually no
memory used up by the thunks in the case of collisions. When an interface method is
called the magic trampoline will fill-in the IMT slot with the proper thunk or
trampoline, so later calls will use the fast path.
Given that only the IMT slots that are actually used will be initialized, this saves
quite a bit of memory, as it's unlikely that all the interface methods are called on
all the different types.
