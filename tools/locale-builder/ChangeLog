	* Driver.cs, Entry.cs, CultureInfoEntry.cs, DateTimeFormatEntry.cs, 
	NumberFormatEntry.cs: create a more compact representation of the
	data.

2004-06-09  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Driver.cs: handle single quotes in the pattern. We used to fail for,
	at least, es and pt cultures with full patterns like
	"EEEE d' de 'MMMM' de 'yyyy".

2004-06-08  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Driver.cs : To make "extra pattern only" xxxFormatLength possible,
	  fill values only when the exact element was available.

2004-06-08  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* DateTimeFormatEntry.cs : Use "{0}" for empty array.

2004-06-08  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* DateTimeFormatEntry.cs : Added "all datetime patterns" support.
	* Driver.cs : Added "all datetime patterns" support and fixed some
	  XPathNavigator use to strictly navigate to "pattern" element.

	* Driver.cs : Percent patterns are not properly parsed since they are
	  in fact not separated by '.'
	* Entry.cs : Escape '\' to "\\" (for Japanese yen-sign fix).

	* Driver.cs :
	  - NumberDecimalDigits are almost differently specified by locale
	    xml files. Almost all of them have ".###", but we need ".##" in
	    almost all the locale. So let's *assume* that the number of
	    digit is always +1 extraneous by this Driver itself.
	    This change accompanies with some existing supp/*.xml changes.

	  - For decimal patterns and currency patterns, when numeric patterns
	    does not have ';'-separated patterns, it ignored the whole pattern
	    string. Fixed it by just copying the same patterns.

	  - When parsing percent patterns, '%' characters were in the way.
	  - When the decimal part of the percent pattern ends with ".##0",
	    the value of PercentDecimalDigits is 2.
	  - Assume PercentDecimalDigits as 2 by default.

	* Driver.cs : Let's ignore DTD that takes most of the running time.

2004-06-03  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Driver.cs : {3} is the almost default number for group digits.

2004-05-26  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Driver.cs : for af_ZA locale, am/pm part got required to support
	  "empty" string. So check am/pm elements and overwrite AMDesigner/
	  PMDesigner value even if they consist of empty string.

	* (moved logs for supp/ content to supp/)

	* Makefile.am: Extract xml files.
	
2004-05-24  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Driver.cs: Filter on GetFiles so we only get the xml locale files.
