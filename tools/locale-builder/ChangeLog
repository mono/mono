	* langs/nb.xml
	  locales/nb_NO.xml : imported from CLDR 1.3 data. (I know I'm
	  directly adding them here, since there seems no simple way to
	  add them as data in "supp" dir).
	* Driver.cs :
	  Reuse XPathDocument for lcids.xml.
	  For "nb-NO" we need tricky code since its parent culture is "no"
	  (not "nb"), while some properties seems based on "nb".

	  Maybe we need some fundamental fixes to consider lcids.xml for
	  parent-child relationship, but right now, it's mostly fruitless.

2005-08-17  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Driver.cs : add primary date/time pattern strings as the first
	  entry of for each "whole specific patterns".
	  (e.g. LongDatePatterns[0] should be LongDatePattern.)

2005-08-17  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* CultureInfoEntry.cs : added RegionId.
	* Driver.cs : modified to not write RegionLCIDMap and use
	  CultureInfoEntry for that lookup purpose instead.

2005-08-15  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* RegionInfoEntry.cs,
	  Driver.cs,
	  Makefile.am : added RegionInfo table output support.

2005-08-11  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* regions.xml : ugh, it does not match something .net returns, so
	  remove it.

2005-08-11  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* regions.xml : new file. All region IDs from existing RegionInfo.cs.

2005-07-07  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Driver.cs : Fixed bug #75499. There were hy_AM.xml and
	  hy_AM_REVISED.xml files in the locale builder archive.

2005-06-27  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Driver.cs : basic pattern string should be added to extra pattern
	  array. This fixes bug #75353.

2005-05-19  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Driver.cs, CultureInfoEntry.cs : Use hacky shallow copy to clone
	  zh-CHS into zh-CHT.

2005-05-18  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Driver.cs : quick workaround for zh-CHT related breakage.

2005-05-12  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Entry.cs :
	  build fix. Incorrectly allowed access to protected member.
	* CultureInfoEntry.cs,
	  Driver.cs :
	  Handle language "zh-CHS" as special case, since there is no "zh".
	* Makefile :
	  use -debug+ instead of -g (convenient when verifying with csc).

2005-02-17  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Driver.cs : set \n for writer's NewLine explicitly (otherwise it
	  results in mixed line ending in culture-info-table.h).

2004-12-13  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@ximian.com>

	* CultureInfoEntry.cs (AppendTableRow): Stringify the
	textinfoentry
	* TextInfoEntry.cs: New file for textinfo data
	* textinfo.xml: textinfo data
	* Driver.cs: Harness all the stuff above
	* Makefile.am: add new files

Mon Aug 9 13:24:09 CEST 2004 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* Driver.cs, Entry.cs, CultureInfoEntry.cs, DateTimeFormatEntry.cs, 
	NumberFormatEntry.cs: create a more compact representation of the
	data.

2004-06-09  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Driver.cs: handle single quotes in the pattern. We used to fail for,
	at least, es and pt cultures with full patterns like
	"EEEE d' de 'MMMM' de 'yyyy".

2004-06-08  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Driver.cs : To make "extra pattern only" xxxFormatLength possible,
	  fill values only when the exact element was available.

2004-06-08  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* DateTimeFormatEntry.cs : Use "{0}" for empty array.

2004-06-08  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* DateTimeFormatEntry.cs : Added "all datetime patterns" support.
	* Driver.cs : Added "all datetime patterns" support and fixed some
	  XPathNavigator use to strictly navigate to "pattern" element.

2004-06-05  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Driver.cs : Percent patterns are not properly parsed since they are
	  in fact not separated by '.'
	* Entry.cs : Escape '\' to "\\" (for Japanese yen-sign fix).

2004-06-05  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Driver.cs :
	  - NumberDecimalDigits are almost differently specified by locale
	    xml files. Almost all of them have ".###", but we need ".##" in
	    almost all the locale. So let's *assume* that the number of
	    digit is always +1 extraneous by this Driver itself.
	    This change accompanies with some existing supp/*.xml changes.

	  - For decimal patterns and currency patterns, when numeric patterns
	    does not have ';'-separated patterns, it ignored the whole pattern
	    string. Fixed it by just copying the same patterns.

	  - When parsing percent patterns, '%' characters were in the way.
	  - When the decimal part of the percent pattern ends with ".##0",
	    the value of PercentDecimalDigits is 2.
	  - Assume PercentDecimalDigits as 2 by default.

2004-06-05  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Driver.cs : Let's ignore DTD that takes most of the running time.

2004-06-03  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Driver.cs : {3} is the almost default number for group digits.

2004-05-26  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Driver.cs : for af_ZA locale, am/pm part got required to support
	  "empty" string. So check am/pm elements and overwrite AMDesigner/
	  PMDesigner value even if they consist of empty string.

	* (moved logs for supp/ content to supp/)

2004-05-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Extract xml files.
	
2004-05-24  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Driver.cs: Filter on GetFiles so we only get the xml locale files.
