Instructions for Symbian:
1. base version: libgc 7.1
2. Build: use libgc.mmp
3. Limitations
3.1.No multi-threaded support

3.2. Be careful with limitation that emulator introduces: Static roots are not
dynamically accessible (there are Symbian APIs for this purpose but are just
stubs, returning irrelevant values).
Consequently, on emulator, you can only use dlls or exe, and retrieve static
roots by calling global_init_static_root per dll (or exe).
On target, only libs are supported, because static roots are retrieved by
linker flags, by calling global_init_static_root in main exe.
