    Garbage Collector (parallel version) for x86 DG/UX Release R4.20MU07


     *READ* the file README.QUICK.

     You need the GCC-3.0.3 rev (DG/UX) compiler to build this tree.
     This compiler has the new "dgux386" threads package implemented.
     It also supports the switch "-pthread" needed to link correctly
     the DG/UX's -lrte -lthread with -lgcc and the system's -lc.
     Finally, we support parallel mark for the SMP DG/UX machines.
     To build the garbage collector do:

      ./configure
      make
      make gctest

     Before you run "gctest" you need to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     correctly so that "gctest" can find the shared library libgc.
     Alternatively you can do a configuration

      ./configure --disable-shared

     to build only the static version of libgc.

     To enable debugging messages please do:
     1) Add the "--enable-gc-debug" flag during configuration.
     2) Pass "CFLAGS=-DDEBUG_THREADS" to "make".

     In a machine with 4 CPUs (my own machine), parallel mark makes
     a BIG difference.

Note (HB):
     The integration of this patch is currently not complete.
     The following patches against 6.1alpha3 where hard to move
     to alpha4, and are not integrated.  There may also be minor
     problems with stylistic corrections made by me.
