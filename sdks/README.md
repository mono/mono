# Open Tasks

## SDKs

- Build nunit-lite as part of the bcl build and ship it there
- Build all test suites as part of the sdk itself
- Move the ARM_CFLAGS & friends to the android makefile generator

## Android

- Add android SDK probing ~/Library/Developer/Xamarin/android-sdk-macosx.  Figure out if we should switch to Android Studio for SDK related stuff (Google got rid of the old SDK scheme).
- Add remaining Android targets
- Make the bcl build use the same setup as the android targets
- Add cross-compiler targets for Android

### XTC specifics

Most Android devices are crap for testing, so we hand pick those that produce reliable and useful results.

Here's the device set to pick in general:

arm32: HTC One
aarch64: Google Pixel
x86_32: Acer Iconia A1-830



## iOS

Everything

Write the iOS driver.
