[2] This threading system uses an unsigned suspend count. Which means a resume cannot be
used as a suspend permit and cancel each other.

Suspend permits are really useful to implement managed synchronization structures that
don't consume native resources. The downside is that they further complicate the design of this
system as the RUNNING state now has a non zero suspend counter.

It can be implemented in the future if we find resume/suspend races that cannot be (efficiently) fixed by other means.

One major issue with suspend permits is runtime facilities (GC, debugger) that must have the target suspended when requested.
This would make permits really harder to add.

sense as a suspend permit, but as explained in [2] we don't support it so this is a bug.

is similar to the one described in [2] when this is used for as a synchronization primitive.
