2002-07-21  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* daemon-messages.c: #include <sys/types.h> and <sys/sockets.h> -
	these are needed for sendmsg() and also for struct msghdr (at
	least on Solaris). Solaris still won't build because struct msghdr
	doesn't have msg_flags, msg_control, or msg_controllen members.
	(CMSG_SPACE): Define for systems that don't have it.
	(CMSG_LEN): Same.

2002-07-10  Dennis Haney  <davh@davh.dk>

	* shared.c:
	* handles.c:
	* daemon.c: Lots of documentation, some added error checking, and
	code readability improvements.

	* daemon-messages.h: Add the Error request type to improve error
	checking.

	* daemon-messages.c: Do a bit more error checking on send() and
	recv(), and log errors with a higher severity level.

2002-07-04  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* daemon.c (process_process_fork): Fix argument handling, due to
	buggy understanding of g_strsplit() behaviour.

2002-07-03  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* threads.h:
	* threads.c: Implement OpenThread().  Define access-control values
	for thread handles.

	* wapi.h:
	* processes.h:
	* access.h:

2002-07-02  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* handles.c (shared_init): Make a second attempt to contact the
	daemon if the shared memory attach succeeds, but the connect()
	fails. (This copes with the daemon crashing without cleaning up
	the shared memory.)

	* Makefile.am: 
	* daemon-private.h:
	* daemon.c:
	* shared.c (_wapi_shm_attach): Don't exec() anything when we fork
	the daemon, it's now built into the library.

2002-06-25  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* daemon.c: 
	* daemon-messages.c: Handle SIGPIPE in a non-stupid way in the
	daemon, if MSG_NOSIGNAL isn't available.  Thanks to Jaroslaw
	Kowalski <jarek@atm.com.pl> for pointing out the bogosity.

2002-06-10  Jaroslaw Kowalski <jarek@atm.com.pl>

2002-06-08  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* mono-mutex.c (mono_once): New convenience function for my
	previous fix.

	* handles.c:
	* error.c: 
	* critical-sections.c: 
	* threads.c:

	* semaphores.c: 
	* processes.c: 
	* mutexes.c: 
	* io.c: 
	* events.c: 
	* atomic.c: Use mono_once() rather than pthread_once().

2002-06-06  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* handles.c (_wapi_handle_new): pthread_once() is not atomic, so
	if multiple threads all try to call _wapi_handle_new() before the
	shared data has been initialized, it is possible that we could get
	into a condition where shared_init() is being executed and later
	threads will pass by pthread_once() due to the fact that it has
	already been called and so therefor will attempt to use the shared
	data before it has been completely initialized. If we instead use
	a standard mutex locking mechanism around shared_init(), we can
	avoid the situation entirely. By wrapping the mutex locking in a
	check to see if we've already initialized the data, we can even
	avoid wasting resources by having to lock/unlock the mutex in any
	later calls (the only time we'd have to worry about
	locking/unlocking is the initial race to call shared_init() at
	startup).

Sat Jun 1 13:27:11 CEST 2002 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* atomic.h: inline asm fixes from Dennis Haney (davh@davh.dk).

Fri May 31 16:21:54 CEST 2002 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* daemon.c, handles.c: rename "sun" local var since it's apparently
	a #define on Solaris.

Fri May 31 15:40:14 CEST 2002 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* daemon-messages.c: work-around MSG_NOSIGNAL missing on some
	platforms.

2002-05-08  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* shared.c: Better error messages, and report when daemon
	connection fails rather than blocking forever.  Do some more
	shared memory sanity checking.

	* handles.c: Better error messages when connecting to shared
	memory and the handle daemon.  Fall back to non-shared handles if
	an error occurs.  Set the default back to 'shared handles'.  Fix a
	crashing bug in scratch space allocation that mangled the block
	headers.

2002-05-07  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* handles.c (shared_init): Disable SHM for now, people have too
	many problems with this, and the diagnostics are not helping.

2002-05-06  Dan Lewis  <dihlewis@yahoo.co.uk>

	* io.c: CreateFile sets win32 last error.

2002-05-05  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* wapi-private.h: 
	* handles-private.h:

	* mutex-private.h: 
	* processes.c: 
	* process-private.h: 
	* semaphores.c: 
	* semaphore-private.h: 
	* sockets.c: 
	* socket-private.h: 
	* events.c: 
	* event-private.h: Simplify the WapiHandleOps struct: take out all
	the file-specific entries, leaving just the items that operate on
	handles themselves.  Split the close operation into shared and
	private parts: shared close is called by the daemon.

	* handles.c: As above, but also pass handle allocation, ref and
	unref operations to the daemon.  Populate the handle_ops array at
	compile time, because the daemon needs to call ops on handles too.
	Don't bother to track open handle counts any more, the daemon does
	that.
	
	* threads.c: 
	* thread-private.h: As above, but also make the thread data
	handle-private.

	* shared.c: Fork a handle daemon if the calling process created
	the shared memory segment.

	* daemon.c:
	* daemon-messages.c:
	* daemon-messages.h:
	* Makefile.am: Build a daemon to manage handle allocation and
	destruction without needing to lock the shared memory

2002-04-30  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* atomic.c: Changed to use a normal mutex rather than a spinlock
	since a lot of platforms seem to not have them :\

2002-04-30  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Completely rewrote the handle waiting code: removed the helper
	thread and its attendant complexity.  All handle waiting is now
	abstracted into the WaitForSingleObject() and
	WaitForMultipleObjects() functions.

	* Implemented inter-process sharing of handles using sysv shared
	memory.  This makes handles even more opaque, with a handle now
	just an index into an array.
	
2002-04-25  Dan Lewis  <dihlewis@yahoo.co.uk>

	* io.c: unitialized pointer in GetCurrentDirectory.

Sat Apr 20 13:37:39 CEST 2002 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* threads.c: destroy the mutex at thread destruction
	(if/when thread destruction code will be actually called).

	thread id in the key.
	
Wed Apr 17 18:36:27 CEST 2002 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* timed-thread.c: avoid race condition when setting the thread to
	detached.

2002-04-16  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* jit.h: to more #include lines to avoid breaking compilation
	under windows when upgrading mingw and w32api to version
	1.3 (thanks Dick!).

2002-04-16  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* atomic.h: Explanatory comment about lack of 80386 support

2002-04-15  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* atomic.h: use xaddl for InterlockedIncrement() and
	InterlockedDecrement().  Use cmpxchgl in a loop for
	InterlockedExchange() and InterlockedExchangePointer().

Mon Apr 15 13:31:22 CEST 2002 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* unicode.c: fix unicode_len() to not access uninitialized memory
	(and updated to conform to mono code style).

Fri Mar 29 17:15:11 CET 2002 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* io.c: EEXISTS is ignored for directory creation.
	* mono-mutex.h: remove silly "pragma }" that emacs users insert
	because they use a broken editor:-)

2002-03-21  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* semaphores.c: Fix a problem when waiting for one or more
