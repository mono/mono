2003-02-11  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* timefuncs.h: 
	* timefuncs.c: Added GetTickCount()

2003-02-06  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* error.c: added WSA_EHOSTUNREACH mapping.

2003-01-26  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* io.c (SetFileAttributes): This routine is not currently
	implemented for the general case, but I added a special case to
	set the executable bit on Linux.

Wed Jan 15 15:55:40 CET 2003 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* sockets.h, daemon.c, io.c: compilation fixes on MacOSX.

2003-01-08  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* sockets.c: Fixed setting blocking mode to true (fixes bug 36388)

2002-12-11  Juli Mallett  <jmallett@FreeBSD.org>

	* daemon.c, handles-private.h, handles.c, wapi-private.h:
	Check for an implementation which says it supports
	_POSIX_THREAD_PROCESS_SHARED, rather than just one that
	defines the symbol.  Defined but with a value of -1 still
	means that it is unsupported.

2002-12-08  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* handles.c (_wapi_handle_new): Create new non-shared handles with
	an initial refcount of 1, not 0.

2002-11-22  Dietmar Maurer  <dietmar@ximian.com>

	* threads.c (TlsGetValue): removed unnecessary mutex

2002-11-20  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* timed-thread.c (_wapi_timed_thread_attach): Attached threads
	need to store their data structure too.

	* threads.c: Make sure the threading data is initialised wherever
	it is needed

2002-11-15  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* timed-thread.c: Removed unneeded parameters in
	_wapi_timed_thread_attach().

	* threads.c: Renamed AttachThread() to make it not look like
	external API.  Removed unneeded parameters.

2002-11-11  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* error.[ch]: added errno_to_WSA (). It displays a warning and return
	WSASYSCALLFAILURE if there is no error mapping for the given errno,

	* sockets.c: use errno_to_WSA and fixed display of warning for h_errno.

2002-10-31  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* io.h: 
	* io.c: Define and use INVALID_FILE_ATTRIBUTES

2002-10-07  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* timefuncs.c:
	* daemon.c: Use a more accurate time source for process start and
	end times.

2002-10-03  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* daemon.c:
	* handles.c:
	* threads.c:  Fixes for freebsd.  Make sure that mutex and condition
	creation and deletion happen in the process that owns them, when
	POSIX shared thread objects aren't supported.  This breaks on
	freebsd, as pthread_t is a pointer to data.

2002-10-02  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* shared.c: Use mmap() instead of sysv shm for the shared data.

	* wapi-private.h (_WAPI_HANDLE_VERSION): Reset back to 0, for the
	new system

	* daemon-private.h: 
	* daemon.c: mmap()ed regions survive fork, so just pass the
	pointer to _wapi_daemon_main instead of mapping it again.

2002-10-01  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* timed-thread.c: Kludge for CREATE_SUSPENDED thread creation.
	Unfortunately libgc uses the same thread suspend technique that I
	want to, and the two don't mix: libgc will deadlock when it tries
	to stop the world if a thread has already been suspended by
	someone else.  Just do the simple suspended create rather than the
	general purpose thread suspension for now.

	* threads.c: Pass create flags to the timed_thread create call, to
	implement suspended thread creation.  ResumeThread() partially
	implemented, to cope with the case where a newly created but
	suspended thread is launched.

2002-09-30  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* sockets.c (ioctlsocket): Set non-blocking mode in a better way,
	with fcntl.

2002-09-27  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* semaphores.c: Only include semaphore.h if it's present. Patch
	for BSD from jmmv@hispabsd.org (Julio Merino).

2002-09-27  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* processes.c: Pass environment and working directory to the
	daemon when forking.  Don't let argv[0] be duplicated when looking
	for the program name.  Implement EnumProcessModules (simple
	version for now, lsof-style later if needed), GetModuleBaseName,
	{Get,Set}ProcessWorkingSetSize (just faked, because the vm hints
	aren't available on Linux).

	* process-private.h: Store the process name, and the working set
	min and max

	* handles.c:
	* handles-private.h: New functions to store and retrieve an array
	of strings in the scratch space

	* daemon.c: Don't miss deleting some handles when a client exits
	(we used to rely on the client doing the final cleanup, but
	obviously if the client is no longer there the daemon has to do
	it).

	Process forking now sets the environment and the working
	directory.

	* io.c: Don't confuse fd 0 with an unassigned handle struct

	* atomic.h: Add a google cache alternative to the msdn URL

2002-09-25  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* sockets.c:
	(_wapi_recvfrom): added ECONNRESET to the switch.

2002-09-24  Mark Crichton  <crichton@gimp.org>

	* atomic.h: Yea.  On linux, sparc isn't sparc, it's __sparc__.
	Added to ifdef.

2002-09-19  Mark Crichton  <crichton@gimp.org>

	* daemon.c, shared.c: Added NEED_LINK_UNLINK for systems that
	dont have Linux's abstract filesystem for sockets.

2002-09-19  Mark Crichton  <crichton@gimp.org>

	* atomic.h: Added SPARC atomic asm code.
	* daemon.c, handles-private.h, handles.c, wapi-private.h:
	undefined _POSIX_THREAD_PROCESS_SHARED.  This actually exists on
	Solaris 9, however, the code paths don't seem to work.  More testing
	on the shared case is *really* needed.

2002-09-03  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* threads.h: 
	* threads.c: Removed PosixKillThread(), because it's not in the
	w32 api

2002-08-20  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* handles.c (_wapi_handle_scratch_store): Made stored byte lengths
	multiples of 4 bytes, to keep header structures aligned.  Needed
	for sparc, at least. (Patch from crichton@gimp.org)

	* handles.c: Removed 'disable_shm' variable (we've defaulted to
	building with shm enabled for months now)

2002-08-19  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* daemon.c: Rewrote the poll() loop to use GIOChannels instead,
	for legacy NeXT-based systems.

2002-08-12  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* atomic.h: Rename some parameters to avoid c++ keywords (Patch
	from Joseph Wenninger <kde@jowenn.at>)

2002-08-05  Dietmar Maurer  <dietmar@ximian.com>

	* threads.c: use fast spinlocks by default

2002-08-02  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* io.c (GetStdHandle): Add a handle reference when returning a
	duplicate console handle.  This fixes the unref_handle errors in
	NUnit.

2002-08-01  Dietmar Maurer  <dietmar@ximian.com>

	* threads.c (TLS_PTHREAD_MUTEX): define this because else some
	tests does not work

2002-08-01  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* threads.c: Use atomic spinlocks in TLS functions

	* mono-spinlock.h:
	* Makefile.am: Added mono-spinlock.h

2002-07-21  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* daemon-messages.c: #include <sys/types.h> and <sys/sockets.h> -
	these are needed for sendmsg() and also for struct msghdr (at
	least on Solaris). Solaris still won't build because struct msghdr
	doesn't have msg_flags, msg_control, or msg_controllen members.
	(CMSG_SPACE): Define for systems that don't have it.
	(CMSG_LEN): Same.

2002-07-20  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* wapi-private.h:
	* io-private.h:
	* io.h:
	* io.c:
	* handles.c: Implemented pipe handles
	
	* handles.c:
	* daemon.c: Fixed bug in handle closing.

	* shared.c:
	* daemon.c: Forked processes now close all open file descriptors.

Fri Jul 19 19:05:19 CEST 2002 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* sockets.h, io-layer.h, critical-sections.h: don't include config.h
	in header files.

2002-07-19  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* threads.c (ExitThread): Call exit() if no threads has been
	created yet.

2002-07-17  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* daemon-messages.c: Freebsd fixes from Andreas Kohn
	<andreas.kohn@gmx.net>

2002-07-15  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* io.c: Removed bogus console_flush() method, that was just cut
	and pasted from file_flush when I separated the two handle types.

2002-07-12  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* io.c (convert_from_flags): Fixed misunderstanding wrt fcntl
	flags.  Fixes bug 27633.

2002-07-12  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* wapi-private.h:
	* handles.c:
	* daemon.c: Use size of sockaddr_un.sun_path from config.h

2002-07-12  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* processes.c (CreateProcess): Send stdin, stdout and stderr
	handles if the startup info doesnt specify new ones

	* io.c (GetStdHandle): Return the same handle when the same
	standard handle is requested

	* handles.c: Pass file descriptors when forking

	* daemon.c: Use supplied file descriptors when forking a new
	process

	* daemon-messages.h: 
	* daemon-messages.c: Pass stdin, stdout and stderr file
	descriptors to the daemon (used when forking)

2002-07-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* daemon.c (_wapi_daemon_main): Use sizeof
	(main_socket_address.sun_path) instead of hardcoded 108 value.

	* handles.c (shared_init): Use sizeof
	(shared_socket_address.sun_path) instead of hardcoded 108 value.

2002-07-10  Dennis Haney  <davh@davh.dk>

	* shared.c:
	* handles.c:
	* daemon.c: Lots of documentation, some added error checking, and
	code readability improvements.

	* daemon-messages.h: Add the Error request type to improve error
	checking.

	* daemon-messages.c: Do a bit more error checking on send() and
	recv(), and log errors with a higher severity level.

2002-07-04  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* daemon.c (process_process_fork): Fix argument handling, due to
	buggy understanding of g_strsplit() behaviour.

2002-07-03  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* threads.h:
	* threads.c: Implement OpenThread().  Define access-control values
	for thread handles.

	* wapi.h:
	* processes.h:
	* access.h:
	* Makefile.am: Added access.h, to hold shared access-control
	definitions

2002-07-02  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* wapi-private.h (_WAPI_HANDLE_VERSION): New protocol version
	
2002-07-02  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* handles.c (shared_init): Make a second attempt to contact the
	daemon if the shared memory attach succeeds, but the connect()
	fails. (This copes with the daemon crashing without cleaning up
	the shared memory.)

	* Makefile.am: 
	* daemon-private.h:
	* daemon.c:
	* shared.c (_wapi_shm_attach): Don't exec() anything when we fork
	the daemon, it's now built into the library.

2002-06-25  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* handles.c:
	* handles-private.h:
	* daemon-messages.h:
	* daemon.c: Process forking and handle data management

	* processes.h:
	* process-private.h:
	* processes.c: Process forking and other support functions

2002-06-25  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* versioninfo.h: PE resource decoding

	* unicode.c (_wapi_unicode_to_utf8): g_utf16_to_utf8 doesnt need
	to be told the string length

	* io.c: Removed the ACTUALLY_DO_UNICODE option.  Fixed some leaks.
	Moved _wapi_time_t_to_filetime and the WapiFileTime typedef to
	timefuncs.c

2002-06-12  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* daemon.c: 
	* daemon-messages.c: Handle SIGPIPE in a non-stupid way in the
	daemon, if MSG_NOSIGNAL isn't available.  Thanks to Jaroslaw
	Kowalski <jarek@atm.com.pl> for pointing out the bogosity.

2002-06-10  Jaroslaw Kowalski <jarek@atm.com.pl>

	* sockets.c, daemon-messages.c: Prevent SIGPIPE from being raised
	when writing to a closed socket.

2002-06-08  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* mono-mutex.c (mono_once): New convenience function for my
	previous fix.

	* handles.c:
	* error.c: 
	* critical-sections.c: 
	* threads.c: 
	* sockets.c: 
	* semaphores.c: 
	* processes.c: 
	* mutexes.c: 
	* io.c: 
	* events.c: 
	* atomic.c: Use mono_once() rather than pthread_once().

2002-06-06  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* handles.c (_wapi_handle_new): pthread_once() is not atomic, so
	if multiple threads all try to call _wapi_handle_new() before the
	shared data has been initialized, it is possible that we could get
	into a condition where shared_init() is being executed and later
	threads will pass by pthread_once() due to the fact that it has
	already been called and so therefor will attempt to use the shared
	data before it has been completely initialized. If we instead use
	a standard mutex locking mechanism around shared_init(), we can
	avoid the situation entirely. By wrapping the mutex locking in a
	check to see if we've already initialized the data, we can even
	avoid wasting resources by having to lock/unlock the mutex in any
	later calls (the only time we'd have to worry about
	locking/unlocking is the initial race to call shared_init() at
	startup).

Sat Jun 1 13:27:11 CEST 2002 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* atomic.h: inline asm fixes from Dennis Haney (davh@davh.dk).

Fri May 31 16:21:54 CEST 2002 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* daemon.c, handles.c: rename "sun" local var since it's apparently
	a #define on Solaris.

Fri May 31 15:40:14 CEST 2002 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* daemon-messages.c: work-around MSG_NOSIGNAL missing on some
	platforms.

2002-05-15  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* wait.c: Fix a deadlock in WaitForMultipleObjects

2002-05-14  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* io.c: Fix a cut&paste error, found by
	Jaroslaw Kowalski <jarek@atm.com.pl>

2002-05-10  Dan Lewis  <dihlewis@yahoo.co.uk>

	* io.c:	Nasty typo.

2002-05-09  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* threads.c: 
	* semaphores.c: 
	* processes.c: 
	* mutexes.c: 
	* handles-private.h: 
	* events.c: 
	* Makefile.am: Remove now-unused file wait-private.h

2002-05-08  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* shared.c: Better error messages, and report when daemon
	connection fails rather than blocking forever.  Do some more
	shared memory sanity checking.

	* handles.c: Better error messages when connecting to shared
	memory and the handle daemon.  Fall back to non-shared handles if
	an error occurs.  Set the default back to 'shared handles'.  Fix a
	crashing bug in scratch space allocation that mangled the block
	headers.

2002-05-07  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* handles.c (shared_init): Disable SHM for now, people have too
	many problems with this, and the diagnostics are not helping.

2002-05-06  Dan Lewis  <dihlewis@yahoo.co.uk>

	* io.c: CreateFile sets win32 last error.

2002-05-05  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* wapi-private.h: 
	* handles-private.h:
	* io.c: 
	* io-private.h:
	* mutexes.c: 
	* mutex-private.h: 
	* processes.c: 
	* process-private.h: 
	* semaphores.c: 
	* semaphore-private.h: 
	* sockets.c: 
	* socket-private.h: 
	* events.c: 
	* event-private.h: Simplify the WapiHandleOps struct: take out all
	the file-specific entries, leaving just the items that operate on
	handles themselves.  Split the close operation into shared and
	private parts: shared close is called by the daemon.

	* handles.c: As above, but also pass handle allocation, ref and
	unref operations to the daemon.  Populate the handle_ops array at
	compile time, because the daemon needs to call ops on handles too.
	Don't bother to track open handle counts any more, the daemon does
	that.
	
	* threads.c: 
	* thread-private.h: As above, but also make the thread data
	handle-private.

	* shared.c: Fork a handle daemon if the calling process created
	the shared memory segment.

	* daemon.c:
	* daemon-messages.c:
	* daemon-messages.h:
	* Makefile.am: Build a daemon to manage handle allocation and
	destruction without needing to lock the shared memory

2002-04-30  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* atomic.c: Changed to use a normal mutex rather than a spinlock
	since a lot of platforms seem to not have them :\

2002-04-30  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Completely rewrote the handle waiting code: removed the helper
	thread and its attendant complexity.  All handle waiting is now
	abstracted into the WaitForSingleObject() and
	WaitForMultipleObjects() functions.

	* Implemented inter-process sharing of handles using sysv shared
	memory.  This makes handles even more opaque, with a handle now
	just an index into an array.
	
2002-04-25  Dan Lewis  <dihlewis@yahoo.co.uk>

	* io.c: unitialized pointer in GetCurrentDirectory.

Sat Apr 20 13:37:39 CEST 2002 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* threads.c: destroy the mutex at thread destruction
	(if/when thread destruction code will be actually called).
	When protecting a tls data pointer from the gc, use also the 
	thread id in the key.
	
Wed Apr 17 18:36:27 CEST 2002 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* timed-thread.c: avoid race condition when setting the thread to
	detached.

2002-04-16  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* jit.h: to more #include lines to avoid breaking compilation
	under windows when upgrading mingw and w32api to version
	1.3 (thanks Dick!).

2002-04-16  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* atomic.h: Explanatory comment about lack of 80386 support

2002-04-15  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* atomic.h: use xaddl for InterlockedIncrement() and
	InterlockedDecrement().  Use cmpxchgl in a loop for
	InterlockedExchange() and InterlockedExchangePointer().

Mon Apr 15 13:31:22 CEST 2002 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* unicode.c: fix unicode_len() to not access uninitialized memory
	(and updated to conform to mono code style).

Fri Mar 29 17:15:11 CET 2002 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* io.c: EEXISTS is ignored for directory creation.
	* mono-mutex.h: remove silly "pragma }" that emacs users insert
	because they use a broken editor:-)

2002-03-28  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* sockets.h: 
	* sockets.c: 
	* io.c: 
	* handles.h:

2002-03-22  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* threads.c: Fix a race condition where a thread can start and
	exit before the handle has been properly initialised (no reason
	why the handle couldn't be initialised beforehand, so do so)

	Fix a ms to ns conversion magnitude thinko.

2002-03-21  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* semaphores.c: Fix a problem when waiting for one or more
	semaphores, and another semaphore is Released (all waiting
	semaphores assumed they were signalled)

2002-03-29  Dan Lewis <dihlewis@yahoo.co.uk>
