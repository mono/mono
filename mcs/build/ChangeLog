	* README.platforms: Update docs for changes below.

	* platforms/win32.make (PLATFORM_CORLIB): Set this variable
	to 'mscorlib.dll', instead of $(corlib) which everything links
	against. *Almost* everything should link against our corlib --
	with the exception of corlib_cmp and corlib_res.

	* platforms/linux.make: Same here: corlib.dll

	* rules.make: Define $(corlib) here.

	* config-default.make (TEST_RUNTIME): Use the platform runtime
	to run tests, by default.

	* profiles/default.make (TEST_RUNTIME): If our test runtime is
	mono, use the --debug flag.

	* executable.make (sourcefile): Add a basename so that we can
	find the nunit sources and so we behave a bit more like
	library.make

	* config-default.make (TEST_HARNESS): Find nunit-console in its
	new home.

	* library.make ($(response)): Do a "Creating ..." line here.

	* executable.make ($(response)): Same.

	* config-default.make: Make warning more forceful.

	* rules.make: Define a useful 'PLATFORM_MONO_NATIVE' that is
	set if the platform does not have a native runtime (ie, linux).
	Also reorder some definitions.

	* Created. See ../ChangeLog for entries earlier than
	this.
