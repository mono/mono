In this directory we have three types of test cases :

	* The test cases which should compile and run without failure (positive test cases). Any 	   failure during compile and run shows some defect in the compiler or class libraries
	* Test cases which should fail during compilation time. If these test cases get compiled 	   without failure denotes that the compiler is deviating from the specification.
	* Test cases those fails during run time.

The make file picks-up test cases from Test.Sources file.

The new test cases have to be added to Test.Sources in appropriate section.

To run the tests type following command
	make run-test-local

All the failure messages gets stored in failures.out file.
