	addOn_ and removeOn_

	readonly fields for all these cases ?

2001-08-31  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@che.iitm.ac.in>

	* class.cs (Property): Revamp to use the convention of making fields readonly.
	Accordingly modify code elsewhere.

	* class.cs : Apply patch from Mr. Mandar <go_mono@hotmail.com> for implementing
	the Define method of the Property class.

	(try_statement): Revamp. Basically, we get rid of one unnecessary rule
	and re-write the code in the actions to extract the specific and
	general catch clauses by being a little smart ;-)

	* ../tests/try.cs : Fix. It's not 'finalize' my friend, it's 'finally' !
	Hooray, try and catch statements parse fine !
	
2001-08-28  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@che.iitm.ac.in>

	* statement.cs (Block::GetVariableType): Fix logic to extract the type
	string from the hashtable of variables.

	information about indexer_declarator.
	(indexer_declarator): Implement actions.

	on Expression Classification.  Now all expressions have a method
	`Resolve' and a method `Emit'.

	* codegen.cs, cs-parser.jay: Fixed the bug that stopped code
	generation from working.     Also add some temporary debugging
	code. 
	
2001-08-24  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* gen-treedump.cs: Bug fix, use s.Increment here instead of
	s.InitStatement.

	move from Properties to public readonly fields.
	(Method::ParameterTypes): Returns the parameter types for the
	function, and implements a cache that will be useful later when I
	do error checking and the semantic analysis on the methods is
	performed.
	(Constructor::GetCallingConvention): Renamed from CallingConvetion
	and made a method, optional argument tells whether this is a class
	or a structure to apply the `has-this' bit.
	(Method::GetCallingConvention): Implement, returns the calling
	convention. 
	(Method::Define): Defines the type, a second pass is performed
	later to populate the methods.

	and the default static constructor.

	(Constructor::) Another class that starts using `public readonly'
	instead of properties. 

	(Constructor::IsDefault): Whether this is a default constructor. 

	(Field::) use readonly public fields instead of properties also.

	(TypeContainer::TypeAttr, TypeContainer::AddConstructor): Keep
	track of static constructors;  If none is used, turn on
	BeforeFieldInit in the TypeAttributes. 

	* cs-parser.jay (opt_argument_list): now the return can be null
	for the cases where there are no arguments. 

	(constructor_declarator): If there is no implicit `base' or
	`this', then invoke the default parent constructor. 
	
	* modifiers.cs (MethodAttr): New static function maps a set of
	modifiers flags into a MethodAttributes enum
	(FieldAttr): renamed from `Map'.  So now we have FieldAttr,
	MethodAttr, TypeAttr to represent the various mappings where the
	modifiers are used.
	(FieldAttr): Map also `readonly' to `FieldAttributes.InitOnly' 	

2001-08-19  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* interface.cs (AddEvent, AddMethod, AddIndexer, AddProperty):
	initialize their hashtables/arraylists only when they are needed
	instead of doing this always.

	* cs-parser.jay: Use an ArrayList to construct the arguments
	instead of the ParameterCollection, and then cast that to a
	Parameter[] array.

	types.

	this System.Reflection code is.  Kudos to Microsoft

	* driver.cs: Make sure we always load mscorlib first (for
	debugging purposes, nothing really important).

	* Renamespaced things that were on `CSC' to `CIR'.  Maybe I should
	have moved to `CSC' rather than `CIR'.  Oh man!  The confussion!  

	* rootcontext.cs: Lookup types on their namespace;  Lookup types
	on namespaces that have been imported using the `using' keyword.

	* class.cs (TypeContainer::TypeAttr): Virtualize.
	(Class::TypeAttr): Return attributes suitable for this bad boy.
	(Struct::TypeAttr): ditto.
	Handle nested classes.
	(TypeContainer::) Remove all the type visiting code, it is now
	replaced with the rootcontext.cs code

2001-08-06  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* interface.cs, statement.cs, class.cs, parameter.cs,

	* rootcontext.cs: 

	* class.cs (Struct::Struct): set the SEALED flags after
	checking the modifiers.
	(TypeContainer::TypeAttr): new property, returns the
	TypeAttributes for a class.  

	* cs-parser.jay (type_list): Oops, list production was creating a
	new list of base types.

	* rootcontext.cs (StdLib): New property.
	(GetInterfaceTypeByName): returns an interface by type name, and
	encapsulates error handling here.
	(GetInterfaces): simplified.
	(ResolveTree): Encapsulated all the tree resolution here.
	(CreateClass, GetClassBases, GetInterfaceOrClass): Create class
	types. 
	
	* driver.cs: Add support for --nostdlib, to avoid loading the
	default assemblies.
	(Main): Do not put tree resolution here. 

	* rootcontext.cs: Beginning of the class resolution.

2001-08-03  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* rootcontext.cs: Provide better error reporting. 

	* cs-parser.jay (interface_base): set our $$ to be interfaces.

	* rootcontext.cs (CreateInterface): Handle the case where there
	are no parent interfaces.
	
	(CloseTypes): Routine to flush types at the end.
	(CreateInterface): Track types.
	(GetInterfaces): Returns an array of Types from the list of
	defined interfaces.

	* typemanager.c (AddUserType): Mechanism to track user types (puts
	the type on the global type hash, and allows us to close it at the
	end). 
	
2001-08-02  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* tree.cs: Removed RecordType, added RecordClass, RecordStruct and
	RecordInterface instead.

	* cs-parser.jay: Updated to reflect changes above.

	* decl.cs (Definition): Keep track of the TypeBuilder type that
	represents this type here.  Not sure we will use it in the long
	run, but wont hurt for now.

	* driver.cs: Smaller changes to accomodate the new code.

	Call ResolveInterfaceBases, Call ResolveClassBases, Save assembly
	when done. 

	* rootcontext.cs (CreateInterface):  New method, used to create
	the System.TypeBuilder type for interfaces.
	(ResolveInterfaces): new entry point to resolve the interface
	hierarchy. 
	(CodeGen): Property, used to keep track of the code generator.

2001-07-26  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* cs-parser.jay: Add a second production for delegate_declaration
	with `VOID'.

	(enum_body): Put an opt_comma here instead of putting it on
	enum_body or enum_member_declarations so we can handle trailing
	commas on enumeration members.  Gets rid of a shift/reduce.
	
	(type_list): Need a COMMA in the middle.

	(indexer_declaration): Tell tokenizer to recognize get/set

	* Remove old targets.

	* Re-add the parser target.

2001-07-13  Simon Cozens <simon@simon-cozens.org>

	* cs-parser.jay: Add precendence rules for a number of operators
	ot reduce the number of shift/reduce conflicts in the grammar.
	
2001-07-17  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* tree.cs: moved IGenerator interface and renamed it to ITreeDump
	and put it here.

	Get rid of old crufty code.

	* rootcontext.cs: Use this to keep track of the parsed
	representation and the defined types available to the program. 

	* gen-treedump.cs: adjust for new convention.

	* type.cs: Split out the type manager, and the assembly builder
	from here. 

	* typemanager.cs: the type manager will live here now.

	* cil-codegen.cs: And the code generator here. 

2001-07-14  Sean MacIsaac  <macisaac@ximian.com>

	* makefile: Fixed up for easy making.

2001-07-13  Simon Cozens <simon@simon-cozens.org>

	* cs-parser.jay (rank_specifier): Remove a conflict by reordering
	the 

	(unary_expression): Expand pre_increment_expression and
	post_decrement_expression to reduce a shift/reduce.

2001-07-11  Simon Cozens

	* cs-tokenizer.cs: Hex numbers should begin with a 0.

	Improve allow_keyword_as_indent name.

2001-06-19  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* Adjustments for Beta2. 

2001-06-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* decl.cs: Added `Define' abstract method.
	(InTransit): new property, used to catch recursive definitions. 

	* interface.cs: Implement `Define'. 

	* modifiers.cs: Map Modifiers.constants to
	System.Reflection.TypeAttribute flags.

	* class.cs: Keep track of types and user-defined types.
	(BuilderInit): New method for creating an assembly
	(ResolveType): New function to launch the resolution process, only
	used by interfaces for now.

	* cs-parser.jay: Keep track of Classes, Structs and Interfaces
	that are inserted into the name space. 

2001-06-08  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* ARGH.  I have screwed up my tree so many times due to the use of
	rsync rather than using CVS.  Going to fix this at once. 

	* driver.cs: Objetify driver.  Load assemblies, use assemblies to
	load types.

2001-06-07  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* Experiment successful: Use System.Type rather that our own
	version of Type.  

2001-05-25  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* cs-parser.jay: Removed nsAliases from here.

	Use new namespaces, handle `using XXX;' 

	* namespace.cs: Reimplemented namespace handling, use a recursive
	definition of the class.  Now we can keep track of using clauses
	and catch invalid using clauses.

2001-05-24  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* gen-treedump.cs: Adapted for all the renaming.

	* expression.cs (Expression): this class now has a Type property
	which returns an expression Type.

	(Probe::, New::, TypeOf::, SizeOf::, Constant::): renamed from
	`Type', as this has a different meaning now in the base

2001-05-22  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* interface.cs, class.cs: Removed from all the sources the
	references to signature computation, as we can not do method
	signature computation during the parsing time, as we are not
	trying to solve at that point distinguishing:

	class X {
		void a (Blah x) {}
		void a (NS.Blah x) {}
	}

	Which depending on the context might be valid or not, as we do not
	know if Blah is the same thing as NS.Blah at that point.

	* Redid everything so the code uses TypeRefs now instead of
	Types.  TypeRefs are just temporary type placeholders, that need
	to be resolved.  They initially have a pointer to a string and the
	current scope in which they are used.  This is used later by the
	compiler to resolve the reference to an actual Type. 

	* DeclSpace is no longer a CIR.Type, and neither are
	TypeContainers (Class and Struct) nor Interfaces nor Enums.  They
	are all DeclSpaces, but no Types. 

	* type.cs (TypeRefManager): This implements the TypeRef manager,
	which keeps track of all the types that need to be resolved after
	the parsing has finished. 

2001-05-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* ARGH.  We are going to have to store `foreach' as a class rather
	than resolving it, as we need to verify error 1579 after name
	resolution.   *OR* we could keep a flag that says `This request to
	IEnumerator comes from a foreach statement' which we can then use
	to generate the error.

2001-05-10  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* class.cs (TypeContainer.AddMethod): we now add methods to the
	MethodGroup instead of the method hashtable.  

	* expression.cs: Add MethodGroup abstraction, which gets us one
	step closer to the specification in the way we handle method
	declarations.  

	* cs-parser.jay (primary_expression): qualified_identifier now
	tried to match up an identifier to a local variable reference or
	to a parameter reference.

	current_local_parameters is now a parser global variable that
	points to the current parameters for the block, used during name
	lookup.

	(property_declaration): Now creates an implicit `value' argument to
	the set accessor.

2001-05-09  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* parameter.cs: Do not use `param' arguments as part of the
	signature, per the spec.

2001-05-08  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* decl.cs: Base class for classes, structs and interfaces.  This
	is the "Declaration Space" 

	* cs-parser.jay: Use CheckDef for checking declaration errors
	instead of having one on each function.

	* class.cs: Factor out some code for handling error handling in
	accordance to the "Declarations" section in the "Basic Concepts"
	chapter in the ECMA C# spec.

	* interface.cs: Make all interface member classes derive from
	InterfaceMemberBase.

2001-05-07  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* Many things: all interfaces are parsed and generated in
	gen-treedump.  Support for member variables, constructors,
	destructors, properties, constants is there.

	Beginning of the IL backend, but very little done, just there for
	testing purposes. 

2001-04-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* cs-parser.jay: Fix labeled statement.

	* cs-tokenizer.cs (escape): Escape " and ' always.
	ref_line, ref_name: keep track of the line/filename as instructed
	by #line by the compiler.
	Parse #line.

2001-04-27  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* System.CodeDOM/CodeBinaryOperatorExpression.cs: Rearrange enum
	to match the values in System.CodeDOM.

	Divid renamed to Divide.

	* System.CodeDOM/CodeForLoopStatement.cs: Always have valid
	statements. 
	(Statements.set): remove.

	* System.CodeDOM/CodeCatchClause.cs: always have a valid
	statements. 

	* System.CodeDOM/CodeIfStatement.cs: trueStatements and
	falseStatements always have valid values. 

	* cs-parser.jay: Use System.CodeDOM now.
