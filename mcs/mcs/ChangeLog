	* decl.cs: Added `Define' abstract method.
	(InTransit): new property, used to catch recursive definitions. 

	* interface.cs: Implement `Define'. 

	* modifiers.cs: Map Modifiers.constants to
	System.Reflection.TypeAttribute flags.

	* class.cs: Keep track of types and user-defined types.
	(BuilderInit): New method for creating an assembly
	(ResolveType): New function to launch the resolution process, only
	used by interfaces for now.

	* cs-parser.jay: Keep track of Classes, Structs and Interfaces
	that are inserted into the name space.

	* ARGH.  I have screwed up my tree so many times due to the use of
	rsync rather than using CVS.  Going to fix this at once. 

	* driver.cs: Objetify driver.  Load assemblies, use assemblies to
	load types.

2001-06-07  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* Experiment successful: Use System.Type rather that our own
	version of Type.  

2001-05-25  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* cs-parser.jay: Removed nsAliases from here.

	Use new namespaces, handle `using XXX;' 

	* namespace.cs: Reimplemented namespace handling, use a recursive
	definition of the class.  Now we can keep track of using clauses
	and catch invalid using clauses.

2001-05-24  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* gen-treedump.cs: Adapted for all the renaming.

	* expression.cs (Expression): this class now has a Type property
	which returns an expression Type.

	(Probe::, New::, TypeOf::, SizeOf::, Constant::): renamed from
	`Type', as this has a different meaning now in the base

2001-05-22  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* interface.cs, class.cs: Removed from all the sources the
	references to signature computation, as we can not do method
	signature computation during the parsing time, as we are not
	trying to solve at that point distinguishing:

	class X {
		void a (Blah x) {}
		void a (NS.Blah x) {}
	}

	Which depending on the context might be valid or not, as we do not
	know if Blah is the same thing as NS.Blah at that point.

	* Redid everything so the code uses TypeRefs now instead of
	Types.  TypeRefs are just temporary type placeholders, that need
	to be resolved.  They initially have a pointer to a string and the
	current scope in which they are used.  This is used later by the
	compiler to resolve the reference to an actual Type. 

	* DeclSpace is no longer a CIR.Type, and neither are
	TypeContainers (Class and Struct) nor Interfaces nor Enums.  They
	are all DeclSpaces, but no Types. 

	* type.cs (TypeRefManager): This implements the TypeRef manager,
	which keeps track of all the types that need to be resolved after
	the parsing has finished. 

2001-05-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* ARGH.  We are going to have to store `foreach' as a class rather
	than resolving it, as we need to verify error 1579 after name
	resolution.   *OR* we could keep a flag that says `This request to
	IEnumerator comes from a foreach statement' which we can then use
	to generate the error.

2001-05-10  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* class.cs (TypeContainer.AddMethod): we now add methods to the
	MethodGroup instead of the method hashtable.  

	* expression.cs: Add MethodGroup abstraction, which gets us one
	step closer to the specification in the way we handle method
	declarations.  

	* cs-parser.jay (primary_expression): qualified_identifier now
	tried to match up an identifier to a local variable reference or
	to a parameter reference.

	current_local_parameters is now a parser global variable that
	points to the current parameters for the block, used during name
	lookup.

	(property_declaration): Now creates an implicit `value' argument to
	the set accessor.

2001-05-09  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* parameter.cs: Do not use `param' arguments as part of the
	signature, per the spec.

2001-05-08  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* decl.cs: Base class for classes, structs and interfaces.  This
	is the "Declaration Space" 

	* cs-parser.jay: Use CheckDef for checking declaration errors
	instead of having one on each function.

	* class.cs: Factor out some code for handling error handling in
	accordance to the "Declarations" section in the "Basic Concepts"
	chapter in the ECMA C# spec.

	* interface.cs: Make all interface member classes derive from
	InterfaceMemberBase.

2001-05-07  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* Many things: all interfaces are parsed and generated in
	gen-treedump.  Support for member variables, constructors,
	destructors, properties, constants is there.

	Beginning of the IL backend, but very little done, just there for
	testing purposes. 

2001-04-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* cs-parser.jay: Fix labeled statement.

	* cs-tokenizer.cs (escape): Escape " and ' always.
	ref_line, ref_name: keep track of the line/filename as instructed
	by #line by the compiler.
	Parse #line.

2001-04-27  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* System.CodeDOM/CodeBinaryOperatorExpression.cs: Rearrange enum
	to match the values in System.CodeDOM.

	Divid renamed to Divide.

	* System.CodeDOM/CodeForLoopStatement.cs: Always have valid
	statements. 
	(Statements.set): remove.

	* System.CodeDOM/CodeCatchClause.cs: always have a valid
	statements. 

	* System.CodeDOM/CodeIfStatement.cs: trueStatements and
	falseStatements always have valid values. 

	* cs-parser.jay: Use System.CodeDOM now.
