2001-10-02  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (Unary::ResolveOperator): Find operators on base type
	too - we now conform exactly to the spec.

	(Binary::ResolveOperator): Same here.

	* class.cs (Operator::Define): Fix minor quirk in the tests.

	* ../errors/cs0215.cs : Added.

	* ../errors/cs0556.cs : Added.

	* ../errors/cs0555.cs : Added.

2001-10-01  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* cs-tokenizer.cs: Reimplemented Location to be a struct with a
	single integer which is really efficient

2001-10-01  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	*  expression.cs (Expression::ImplicitUserConversion): Use location
        even in the case when we are examining True operators.
 
        * class.cs (Operator::Define): Perform extensive checks to conform
        with the rules for operator overloading in the spec.

	* expression.cs (Expression::ImplicitReferenceConversion): Implement
	some of the other conversions mentioned in the spec.

	* typemanager.cs (array_type): New static member for the System.Array built-in
	type.

	(cloneable_interface): For System.ICloneable interface.

	* driver.cs (Driver::Driver): Initialize TypeManager's core types even before
	we start resolving the tree and populating types.

	* ../errors/errors.txt : Update for error numbers -7, -8, -9, -10
 
2001-10-01  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (Expression::ExprClassFromMemberInfo,
	Expression::Literalize): Create literal expressions from
	FieldInfos which are literals.

	(ConvertNumericExplicit, ImplicitNumericConversion): Fix a few
	type casts, because they were wrong.  The test suite in tests
	caught these ones.

	(ImplicitNumericConversion): ushort to ulong requires a widening
	cast. 

	Int32 constant to long requires widening cast as well.

	* literal.cs (LongLiteral::EmitLong): Do not generate i4 constants
	for integers because the type on the stack is not i4.

2001-09-30  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (report118): require location argument. 

	* parameter.cs: Do not dereference potential null value.

	* class.cs: Catch methods that lack the `new' keyword when
	overriding a name.  Report warnings when `new' is used without
	anything being there to override.

	* modifiers.cs: Handle `NEW' as MethodAttributes.NewSlot.

	* class.cs: Only add constructor to hashtable if it is non-null
	(as now constructors can fail on define).

	(TypeManager, Class, Struct): Take location arguments.

	Catch field instance initialization in structs as errors.

	accepting_filter: a new filter for FindMembers that is static so
	that we dont create an instance per invocation.

	(Constructor::Define): Catch errors where a struct constructor is
	parameterless 

	* cs-parser.jay: Pass location information for various new
	constructs. 
	
	* delegate.cs (Delegate): take a location argument.

	* driver.cs: Do not call EmitCode if there were problesm in the
	Definition of the types, as many Builders wont be there. 

	* decl.cs (Decl::Decl): Require a location argument.

	* cs-tokenizer.cs: Handle properly hex constants that can not fit
	into integers, and find the most appropiate integer for it.

	* literal.cs: Implement ULongLiteral.

	* rootcontext.cs: Provide better information about the location of
	failure when CreateType fails.
	
2001-09-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* rootcontext.cs (RootContext::PopulateTypes): Populates structs
	as well.

	* expression.cs (Binary::CheckShiftArguments): Add missing type
	computation.
	(Binary::ResolveOperator): Add type to the logical and and logical
	or, Bitwise And/Or and Exclusive Or code paths, it was missing
	before.

	(Binary::DoNumericPromotions): In the case where either argument
	is ulong (and most signed types combined with ulong cause an
	error) perform implicit integer constant conversions as well.

2001-09-28  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (UserImplicitCast): Method should always be
	non-null. 
	(Invocation::BetterConversion): Simplified test for IntLiteral.

	(Expression::ImplicitNumericConversion): Split this routine out.
	Put the code that performs implicit constant integer conversions
	here. 

	(Expression::Resolve): Become a wrapper around DoResolve so we can
	check eclass and type being set after resolve.

	(Invocation::Badness): Remove this dead function

	(Binary::ResolveOperator): Do not compute the expensive argumnets
	unless we have a union for it.

	(Probe::Emit): Is needs to do an isinst and then
	compare against null.

	(::CanConvert): Added Location argument.  If the Location argument
	is null (Location.Null), then we do not report errors.  This is
	used by the `probe' mechanism of the Explicit conversion.  We do
	not want to generate an error for something that the user
	explicitly requested to be casted.  But the pipeline for an
	explicit cast first tests for potential implicit casts.

	So for now, if the Location is null, it means `Probe only' to
	avoid adding another argument.   Might have to revise this
	strategy later.

	(ClassCast): New class used to type cast objects into arbitrary
	classes (used in Explicit Reference Conversions).

	Implement `as' as well.

	Reverted all the patches from Ravi below: they were broken:

		* The use of `level' as a mechanism to stop recursive
		  invocations is wrong.  That was there just to catch the
		  bug with a strack trace but not as a way of addressing
		  the problem.

		  To fix the problem we have to *understand* what is going
		  on and the interactions and come up with a plan, not
		  just get things going.

		* The use of the type conversion cache that I proposed
		  last night had an open topic: How does this work across
		  protection domains.  A user defined conversion might not
		  be public in the location where we are applying the
		  conversion, a different conversion might be selected
		  (ie, private A->B (better) but public B->A (worse),
		  inside A, A->B applies, but outside it, B->A will
		  apply).

		* On top of that (ie, even if the above is solved),
		  conversions in a cache need to be abstract.  Ie, `To
		  convert from an Int to a Short use an OpcodeCast', not
		  `To convert from an Int to a Short use the OpcodeCast on
		  the variable 5' (which is what this patch was doing).
	
2001-09-28  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (Invocation::ConversionExists): Re-write to use
	the conversion cache
	
	(Expression::ConvertImplicit): Automatic bailing out if level != 0. Also
	cache all conversions done, not just user-defined ones.

	(Invocation::BetterConversion): The real culprit. Use ConversionExists
	to determine if a conversion exists instead of acutually trying to 
	perform the conversion. It's faster too.

	(Expression::ConvertExplicit): Modify to use ConversionExists to check
	and only then attempt the implicit conversion.

2001-09-28  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (ConvertImplicit): Use a cache for conversions
	already found. Check level of recursion and bail out if necessary.

	report the errors for not used variables.

	* expression.cs (Conditional::Resolve, ::Emit): Implement ?:
	operator. 

2001-09-27  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* codegen.cs: remove unnneded code 

	* expression.cs: Removed BuiltinTypeAccess class

	Fix the order in which implicit conversions are
	done.  

	The previous fixed dropped support for boxed conversions (adding a
	test to the test suite now)

	(UserImplicitCast::CanConvert): Remove test for source being null,
	that code is broken.  We should not feed a null to begin with, if
	we do, then we should track the bug where the problem originates
	and not try to cover it up here.

	Return a resolved expression of type UserImplicitCast on success
	rather than true/false.  Ravi: this is what I was talking about,
	the pattern is to use a static method as a "constructor" for
	objects. 

	Also, do not create arguments until the very last minute,
	otherwise we always create the arguments even for lookups that
	will never be performed. 

	(UserImplicitCast::Resolve): Eliminate, objects of type
	UserImplicitCast are born in a fully resolved state. 
	
	* typemanager.cs (InitCoreTypes): Init also value_type
	(System.ValueType). 

	* expression.cs (Cast::Resolve): First resolve the child expression.

	(LValue): Add new method AddressOf to be used by
	the `&' operator.  

	Change the argument of Store to take an EmitContext instead of an
	ILGenerator, because things like FieldExpr need to be able to call
	their children expression to generate the instance code. 

	(Expression::Error, Expression::Warning): Sugar functions for
	reporting errors.

	(Expression::MemberLookup): Accept a TypeContainer instead of a
	Report as the first argument.

	(Expression::ResolvePrimary): Killed.  I still want to improve
	this as currently the code is just not right.

	(Expression::ResolveMemberAccess): Simplify, but it is still
	wrong. 

	(Unary::Resolve): Catch errors in AddressOf operators.

	(LocalVariableReference::Emit, ::Store, ::AddressOf): typecast
	index to a byte for the short-version, or the compiler will choose
	the wrong Emit call, which generates the wrong data.

	(ParameterReference::Emit, ::Store): same.

	(FieldExpr::AddressOf): Implement.
	
	* typemanager.cs: TypeManager: made public variable instead of
	property.
	
	* driver.cs: document --fatal.

	* report.cs (ErrorMessage, WarningMessage): new names for the old
	Error and Warning classes.

	* cs-parser.jay (member_access): Turn built-in access to types
	into a normal simplename

	(ConvertImplicit): Call CanConvert and only then create object if necessary.
	(UserImplicitCast::CanConvert, ::Resolve): Re-write.

	(Unary::Operator): Rename Add and Subtract to Addition and Subtraction because
	that is the right way. 

	(Invocation::MakeUnionSet): Convenience function to make unions of sets for 
	overloading resolution. Use everywhere instead of cutting and pasting code.

	(Binary::ResolveOperator): Use MakeUnionSet.

	(UserImplicitCast::CanConvert, ::Resolve): Update to take care of the case when 
	we have to convert to bool types. Not complete yet.
	
2001-09-27  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* typemanager.cs (TypeManager::CSharpName): support ushort.

	* expression.cs (Expression::TryImplicitIntConversion): Attempts
	to provide an expression that performsn an implicit constant int
	conversion (section 6.1.6).
	(Expression::ConvertImplicitRequired): Reworked to include
	implicit constant expression conversions.

	(Expression::ConvertNumericExplicit): Finished.

	(Invocation::Emit): If InstanceExpression is null, then it means
	that we perform a call on this.

	* expression.cs (Unary::Emit): Remove some dead code.
	(Probe): Implement Resolve and Emit for `is'.
	(Expression::ConvertImplicitRequired): Attempt to do constant

	that tell whether is it possible to apply an implicit constant
	expression conversion.

	* class.cs (Operator): Update the operator names to reflect the
	ones that the spec expects (as we are just stringizing the
	operator names).
	
	* expression.cs (Unary::ResolveOperator): Fix bug: Use
	MethodInfo's ReturnType instead of LookupMethodByBuilder as the
	previous usage did only work for our methods.
	(Expression::ConvertImplicit): Handle decimal implicit numeric
	conversions as well.
	(Expression::InternalTypeConstructor): Used to invoke constructors
	on internal types for default promotions.

	(Unary::Emit): Implement special handling for the pre/post
	increment/decrement for overloaded operators, as they need to have
	the same semantics as the other operators.

	(Binary::ResolveOperator): ditto.
	(Invocation::ConversionExists): ditto.
	(UserImplicitCast::Resolve): ditto.
	
2001-09-26  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	whether a value is left on the stack or not.  Every expression
	after being emitted leaves a single value on the stack.

	* codegen.cs (EmitContext::EmitStatementExpression): Use the
	facilties of ExpressionStatement if possible.

	* cs-parser.jay: Update statement_expression.

2001-09-25  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* typemanager.cs: declare and load enum_type, delegate_type and
	void_type. 

	* expression.cs (Expression::Emit): Now emit returns a value that

	(FieldExpr::Instance): New field used to track the expression that
	represents the object instance.
	(FieldExpr::Resolve): Track potential errors from MemberLookup not
	binding 
	(FieldExpr::Emit): Implement.

	* codegen.cs (EmitIf, EmitStatement, EmitBlock): Propagate whether
	the last instruction contains a return opcode to avoid generating
	the last `ret' instruction (this generates correct code, and it is
	nice to pass the peverify output).

	* class.cs (TypeContainer::EmitFieldInitializers): Implement field
	initializer for static and instance variables.
	(Constructor::Emit): Allow initializer to be null in the case of
	static constructors.  Only emit initializer for instance
	constructors.

	deal with this by semantically definining it as if the user had
	done it.

	(TypeContainer::FindMembers): Removed ad-hoc hack to deal with
	constructors as we now "emit" them at a higher level.

	(TypeContainer::DefineDefaultConstructor): Used to define the
	default constructors if none was provided.

	(ConstructorInitializer): Add methods Resolve and Emit. 
	
	* expression.cs: Cast to ConstructorInfo instead of MethodInfo

2001-09-17  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	(Constructor::Emit): Implement.
	(EmitStaticFieldInitializers, EmitFieldInitializers): Ensure we return immediately
	if we have no work to do. 
	(TypeContainer::Emit): Pass in TypeContainer as argument to the constructor's 
	Emit method.

	* tree.cs (Tree::namespaces): New hashtable to keep track of namespaces
	in the source.

	* report.cs: Allow throwing exceptions on errors for debugging.

	* modifiers.cs: Do not use `parent', instead use the real type
	container to evaluate permission settings.

	* modifiers.cs (TypeAttr, MethodAttr, FieldAttr): Map protected internal to
	FamORAssem, not FamANDAssem.
	
2001-09-14  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* driver.cs: Added --parse option that only parses its input files
	and terminates.

	* class.cs: Reverted last change from Ravi to IsTopLevel.  That is
	incorrect.  IsTopLevel is not used to tell whether an object is
	root_types or not (that can be achieved by testing this ==
	root_types).  But to see if this is a top-level *class* (not
	necessarly our "toplevel" container). 

2001-09-14  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* enum.cs (Enum::Define): Modify to call the Lookup method on the

2001-09-14  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	to precisely that info.

	* modifiers.cs (MethodAttr): Re-write.
	(EventAttr): Remove altogether as there seems to be no ostensible use for it.

	* class.cs (TypeContainer::IsTopLevel): Re-write. root_types doesn't seem to be the parent
	of top-level types as claimed.
	
2001-09-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (MemberLookup): Fruitless attempt to lookup

	(Invocation::OverloadResolve): Cope with Arguments == null.
	(Invocation::EmitArguments): new function, shared by the new
	constructor and us.

	objects that we might have around.

	(Populate): Only initialize method_builders_to_methods once.

	* expression.cs (PropertyExpr): Initialize type from the
	PropertyType. 

	* codegen.cs (EmitContext::EmitBoolExpression): Use propper

	* expression.cs: Set the type for the int32/int32 argument case.
	(Binary::ResolveOperator): Set the return type to boolean for
	comparission operators

	* typemanager.cs: Remove debugging print code.

	(Invocation::Resolve): resolve type.

	* class.cs: Allocate a MemberInfo of the correct size, as the code
	elsewhere depends on the test to reflect the correct contents.

	(Method::) Keep track of parameters, due to System.Reflection holes

	(TypeContainer::Populate): Keep track of MethodBuilders to Method
	mapping here.

	(TypeContainer::FindMembers): Use ArrayList and then copy an array
	of the exact size and return that.

	(Class::LookupMethodByBuilder): New function that maps
	MethodBuilders to its methods.  Required to locate the information
	on methods because System.Reflection bit us again.

	* support.cs: New file, contains an interface ParameterData and
	two implementations: ReflectionParameters and InternalParameters
	used to access Parameter information.  We will need to grow this
	as required.

	* expression.cs (Invocation::GetParameterData): implement a cache
	and a wrapper around the ParameterData creation for methods. 
	(Invocation::OverloadResolve): Use new code.

	* parameter.cs (GetParameterInfo): Use a type cache to compute
	things only once, and to reuse this information

	* expression.cs (LocalVariableReference::Emit): Implement.
	(OpcodeCast::Emit): fix.

	(ParameterReference::Resolve): Implement.
	(ParameterReference::Emit): Implement.

	* cs-parser.jay: Fix bug introduced by Ravi, variable initializers

	of the location being passed in too. Ideally, this should go later since all
	error reporting should be done through the Report object.

	(Populate): Iterate thru the indexers we have and define them too.
	(Indexer.GetMethodBuilder, .SetMethodBuilder): New members to hold the method builders

	information about indexer_declarator.
	(indexer_declarator): Implement actions.
	(parsing_indexer): New local boolean used to keep track of whether
	we are parsing indexers or properties. This is necessary because 
	implicit_parameters come into picture even for the get accessor in the 
	case of an indexer.
	(get_accessor_declaration, set_accessor_declaration): Correspondingly modified.

	* class.cs (Indexer): New class for indexer declarations.
	(TypeContainer::AddIndexer): New method to add an indexer to a type.
	(TypeContainer::indexers): New member to hold list of indexers for the
	type.

2001-08-27  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@che.iitm.ac.in>

	* cs-parser.jay (add_accessor_declaration): Implement action.
	(remove_accessor_declaration): Implement action.
	(event_accessors_declaration): Implement
	(variable_declarators): swap statements for first rule - trivial.

	* class.cs (Event): New class to hold information about event
	declarations.
	(TypeContainer::AddEvent): New method to add an event to a type
	(TypeContainer::events): New member to hold list of events.

	* cs-parser.jay (event_declaration): Implement actions.

2001-08-27  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@che.iitm.ac.in>

	* cs-parser.jay (dim_separators): Implement. Make it a string
	concatenating all the commas together, just as they appear.
	(opt_dim_separators): Modify accordingly
	(rank_specifiers): Update accordingly. Basically do the same
	thing - instead, collect the brackets here.
	(opt_rank_sepcifiers): Modify accordingly.
	(array_type): Modify to actually return the complete type string
	instead of ignoring the rank_specifiers.
	(expression_list): Implement to collect the expressions
	(variable_initializer): Implement. We make it a list of expressions
	essentially so that we can handle the array_initializer case neatly too.
	(variable_initializer_list): Implement.
	(array_initializer): Make it a list of variable_initializers
	(opt_array_initializer): Modify accordingly.

	* expression.cs (New::NType): Add enumeration to help us
	keep track of whether we have an object/delegate creation
	or an array creation.
	(New:NewType, New::Rank, New::Indices, New::Initializers): New
	members to hold data about array creation.
	(New:New): Modify to update NewType
	(New:New): New Overloaded contructor for the array creation
	case.

	* cs-parser.jay (array_creation_expression): Implement to call
	the overloaded New constructor.
	
2001-08-26  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@che.iitm.ac.in>

	* class.cs (TypeContainer::Constructors): Return member
	constructors instead of returning null.

2001-08-26  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* typemanager.cs (InitCoreTypes): Initialize the various core
	types after we have populated the type manager with the user
	defined types (this distinction will be important later while
	compiling corlib.dll)

	* expression.cs, literal.cs, assign.cs, constant.cs: Started work
	on Expression Classification.  Now all expressions have a method
	`Resolve' and a method `Emit'.

	* codegen.cs, cs-parser.jay: Fixed the bug that stopped code
	generation from working.     Also add some temporary debugging
	code. 
	
2001-08-24  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* codegen.cs: Lots of code generation pieces.  This is only the
	beginning, will continue tomorrow with more touches of polish.  We
	handle the fundamentals of if, while, do, for, return.  Others are
	trickier and I need to start working on invocations soon.
	
	* gen-treedump.cs: Bug fix, use s.Increment here instead of
	s.InitStatement. 

	* codegen.cs (EmitContext): New struct, used during code
	emission to keep a context.   Most of the code generation will be
	here. 

	* cs-parser.jay: Add embedded blocks to the list of statements of
	this block.  So code generation proceeds in a top down fashion.

2001-08-23  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* statement.cs: Add support for multiple child blocks.

2001-08-22  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	Block of code given a TypeContainer and its ILGenerator. 

	* statement.cs (Block): Standard public readonly optimization.
	(Block::Block constructors): Link children. 
	(Block::Child): Child Linker.
	(Block::EmitVariables): Emits IL variable declarations.

	* class.cs: Drop support for MethodGroups here, delay until
	Semantic Analysis.
	(Method::): Applied the same simplification that I did before, and
	move from Properties to public readonly fields.
	(Method::ParameterTypes): Returns the parameter types for the
	function, and implements a cache that will be useful later when I
	do error checking and the semantic analysis on the methods is
	performed.
	(Constructor::GetCallingConvention): Renamed from CallingConvetion
	and made a method, optional argument tells whether this is a class
	or a structure to apply the `has-this' bit.
	(Method::GetCallingConvention): Implement, returns the calling
	convention. 
	(Method::Define): Defines the type, a second pass is performed
	later to populate the methods.

	(Constructor::ParameterTypes): implement a cache similar to the
	one on Method::ParameterTypes, useful later when we do semantic
	analysis. 

	(TypeContainer::EmitMethod):  New method.  Emits methods.

	* expression.cs: Removed MethodGroup class from here.
	
	* parameter.cs (Parameters::GetCallingConvention): new method.

	* class.cs (TypeContainer::Populate): Drop RootContext from the
	argument. 

	(Constructor::CallingConvention): Returns the calling convention.
	(Constructor::ParameterTypes): Returns the constructor parameter
	types. 
	
	(TypeContainer::AddConstructor): Keep track of default constructor
	and the default static constructor.

	(Constructor::) Another class that starts using `public readonly'
	instead of properties. 

	(Constructor::IsDefault): Whether this is a default constructor. 

	(Field::) use readonly public fields instead of properties also.

	(TypeContainer::TypeAttr, TypeContainer::AddConstructor): Keep
	track of static constructors;  If none is used, turn on
	BeforeFieldInit in the TypeAttributes. 

	* cs-parser.jay (opt_argument_list): now the return can be null
	for the cases where there are no arguments. 

	(constructor_declarator): If there is no implicit `base' or
	`this', then invoke the default parent constructor. 
	
	* modifiers.cs (MethodAttr): New static function maps a set of
	modifiers flags into a MethodAttributes enum
	(FieldAttr): renamed from `Map'.  So now we have FieldAttr,
	MethodAttr, TypeAttr to represent the various mappings where the
	modifiers are used.
	(FieldAttr): Map also `readonly' to `FieldAttributes.InitOnly' 	

2001-08-19  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* parameter.cs (GetParameterInfo): Fix bug where there would be no
	method arguments.

	* interface.cs (PopulateIndexer): Implemented the code generator
	for interface indexers.

2001-08-17  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* interface.cs (InterfaceMemberBase): Now we track the new status
	here.  

	(PopulateProperty): Implement property population.  Woohoo!  Got
	Methods and Properties going today. 

	Removed all the properties for interfaces, and replaced them with
	`public readonly' fields. 

2001-08-16  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* interface.cs (AddEvent, AddMethod, AddIndexer, AddProperty):
	initialize their hashtables/arraylists only when they are needed
	instead of doing this always.

	* parameter.cs: Handle refs and out parameters.

	* cs-parser.jay: Use an ArrayList to construct the arguments
	instead of the ParameterCollection, and then cast that to a
	Parameter[] array.

	* parameter.cs: Drop the use of ParameterCollection and use
	instead arrays of Parameters.

	(GetParameterInfo): Use the Type, not the Name when resolving
	types. 

2001-08-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* parameter.cs: Eliminate the properties Name, Type and ModFlags,
	and instead use public readonly fields.

	* class.cs: Put back walking code for type containers.

2001-08-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* class.cs (MakeConstant): Code to define constants.

	* rootcontext.cs (LookupType): New function.  Used to locate types 

	
2001-08-08  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* rootcontext.cs: OH MY!  My trick works!   It is amazing how nice
	this System.Reflection code is.  Kudos to Microsoft
	
	* typemanager.cs: Implement a type cache and avoid loading all
	types at boot time.  Wrap in LookupType the internals.  This made
	the compiler so much faster.  Wow.  I rule!
	
	* driver.cs: Make sure we always load mscorlib first (for
	debugging purposes, nothing really important).

	* Renamespaced things that were on `CSC' to `CIR'.  Maybe I should
	have moved to `CSC' rather than `CIR'.  Oh man!  The confussion!  

	* rootcontext.cs: Lookup types on their namespace;  Lookup types
	on namespaces that have been imported using the `using' keyword.

	* class.cs (TypeContainer::TypeAttr): Virtualize.
	(Class::TypeAttr): Return attributes suitable for this bad boy.
	(Struct::TypeAttr): ditto.
	Handle nested classes.
	(TypeContainer::) Remove all the type visiting code, it is now
	replaced with the rootcontext.cs code

	* rootcontext.cs (GetClassBases): Added support for structs. 

2001-08-06  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* interface.cs, statement.cs, class.cs, parameter.cs,
	rootcontext.cs, gen-treedump.cs, enum.cs, cs-parse.jay:
	Drop use of TypeRefs, and use strings instead.

2001-08-04  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* rootcontext.cs: 

	* class.cs (Struct::Struct): set the SEALED flags after
	checking the modifiers.
	(TypeContainer::TypeAttr): new property, returns the
	TypeAttributes for a class.  

	* cs-parser.jay (type_list): Oops, list production was creating a
	new list of base types.

	* rootcontext.cs (StdLib): New property.
	(GetInterfaceTypeByName): returns an interface by type name, and
	encapsulates error handling here.
	(GetInterfaces): simplified.
	(ResolveTree): Encapsulated all the tree resolution here.
	(CreateClass, GetClassBases, GetInterfaceOrClass): Create class
	types. 
	
	* driver.cs: Add support for --nostdlib, to avoid loading the
	default assemblies.
	(Main): Do not put tree resolution here. 

	* rootcontext.cs: Beginning of the class resolution.

2001-08-03  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* rootcontext.cs: Provide better error reporting. 

	* cs-parser.jay (interface_base): set our $$ to be interfaces.

	* rootcontext.cs (CreateInterface): Handle the case where there
	are no parent interfaces.
	
	(CloseTypes): Routine to flush types at the end.
	(CreateInterface): Track types.
	(GetInterfaces): Returns an array of Types from the list of
	defined interfaces.

	* typemanager.c (AddUserType): Mechanism to track user types (puts
	the type on the global type hash, and allows us to close it at the
	end). 
	
2001-08-02  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* tree.cs: Removed RecordType, added RecordClass, RecordStruct and
	RecordInterface instead.

	* cs-parser.jay: Updated to reflect changes above.

	* decl.cs (Definition): Keep track of the TypeBuilder type that
	represents this type here.  Not sure we will use it in the long
	run, but wont hurt for now.

	* driver.cs: Smaller changes to accomodate the new code.

	Call ResolveInterfaceBases, Call ResolveClassBases, Save assembly
	when done. 

	* rootcontext.cs (CreateInterface):  New method, used to create
	the System.TypeBuilder type for interfaces.
	(ResolveInterfaces): new entry point to resolve the interface
	hierarchy. 
	(CodeGen): Property, used to keep track of the code generator.

2001-07-26  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* cs-parser.jay: Add a second production for delegate_declaration
	with `VOID'.

	(enum_body): Put an opt_comma here instead of putting it on
	enum_body or enum_member_declarations so we can handle trailing
	commas on enumeration members.  Gets rid of a shift/reduce.
	
	(type_list): Need a COMMA in the middle.

	(indexer_declaration): Tell tokenizer to recognize get/set

	* Remove old targets.

	* Re-add the parser target.

2001-07-13  Simon Cozens <simon@simon-cozens.org>

	* cs-parser.jay: Add precendence rules for a number of operators
	ot reduce the number of shift/reduce conflicts in the grammar.
	
2001-07-17  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* tree.cs: moved IGenerator interface and renamed it to ITreeDump
	and put it here.

	Get rid of old crufty code.

	* rootcontext.cs: Use this to keep track of the parsed
	representation and the defined types available to the program. 

	* gen-treedump.cs: adjust for new convention.

	* type.cs: Split out the type manager, and the assembly builder
	from here. 

	* typemanager.cs: the type manager will live here now.

	* cil-codegen.cs: And the code generator here. 

2001-07-14  Sean MacIsaac  <macisaac@ximian.com>

	* makefile: Fixed up for easy making.

2001-07-13  Simon Cozens <simon@simon-cozens.org>

	* cs-parser.jay (rank_specifier): Remove a conflict by reordering
	the 

	(unary_expression): Expand pre_increment_expression and
	post_decrement_expression to reduce a shift/reduce.

2001-07-11  Simon Cozens

	* cs-tokenizer.cs: Hex numbers should begin with a 0.

	Improve allow_keyword_as_indent name.

2001-06-19  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* Adjustments for Beta2. 

2001-06-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* decl.cs: Added `Define' abstract method.
	(InTransit): new property, used to catch recursive definitions. 

	* interface.cs: Implement `Define'. 

	* modifiers.cs: Map Modifiers.constants to
	System.Reflection.TypeAttribute flags.

	* class.cs: Keep track of types and user-defined types.
	(BuilderInit): New method for creating an assembly
	(ResolveType): New function to launch the resolution process, only
	used by interfaces for now.

	* cs-parser.jay: Keep track of Classes, Structs and Interfaces
	that are inserted into the name space. 

2001-06-08  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* ARGH.  I have screwed up my tree so many times due to the use of
	rsync rather than using CVS.  Going to fix this at once. 

	* driver.cs: Objetify driver.  Load assemblies, use assemblies to
	load types.

2001-06-07  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* Experiment successful: Use System.Type rather that our own
	version of Type.  

2001-05-25  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* cs-parser.jay: Removed nsAliases from here.

	Use new namespaces, handle `using XXX;' 

	* namespace.cs: Reimplemented namespace handling, use a recursive
	definition of the class.  Now we can keep track of using clauses
	and catch invalid using clauses.

2001-05-24  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* gen-treedump.cs: Adapted for all the renaming.

	* expression.cs (Expression): this class now has a Type property
	which returns an expression Type.

	(Probe::, New::, TypeOf::, SizeOf::, Constant::): renamed from
	`Type', as this has a different meaning now in the base

2001-05-22  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* interface.cs, class.cs: Removed from all the sources the
	references to signature computation, as we can not do method
	signature computation during the parsing time, as we are not
	trying to solve at that point distinguishing:

	class X {
		void a (Blah x) {}
		void a (NS.Blah x) {}
	}

	Which depending on the context might be valid or not, as we do not
	know if Blah is the same thing as NS.Blah at that point.

	* Redid everything so the code uses TypeRefs now instead of
	Types.  TypeRefs are just temporary type placeholders, that need
	to be resolved.  They initially have a pointer to a string and the
	current scope in which they are used.  This is used later by the
	compiler to resolve the reference to an actual Type. 

	* DeclSpace is no longer a CIR.Type, and neither are
	TypeContainers (Class and Struct) nor Interfaces nor Enums.  They
	are all DeclSpaces, but no Types. 

	* type.cs (TypeRefManager): This implements the TypeRef manager,
	which keeps track of all the types that need to be resolved after
	the parsing has finished. 

2001-05-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* ARGH.  We are going to have to store `foreach' as a class rather
	than resolving it, as we need to verify error 1579 after name
	resolution.   *OR* we could keep a flag that says `This request to
	IEnumerator comes from a foreach statement' which we can then use
	to generate the error.

2001-05-10  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* class.cs (TypeContainer.AddMethod): we now add methods to the
	MethodGroup instead of the method hashtable.  

	* expression.cs: Add MethodGroup abstraction, which gets us one
	step closer to the specification in the way we handle method
	declarations.  

	* cs-parser.jay (primary_expression): qualified_identifier now
	tried to match up an identifier to a local variable reference or
	to a parameter reference.

	current_local_parameters is now a parser global variable that
	points to the current parameters for the block, used during name
	lookup.

	(property_declaration): Now creates an implicit `value' argument to
	the set accessor.

2001-05-09  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* parameter.cs: Do not use `param' arguments as part of the
	signature, per the spec.

2001-05-08  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* decl.cs: Base class for classes, structs and interfaces.  This
	is the "Declaration Space" 

	* cs-parser.jay: Use CheckDef for checking declaration errors
	instead of having one on each function.

	* class.cs: Factor out some code for handling error handling in
	accordance to the "Declarations" section in the "Basic Concepts"
	chapter in the ECMA C# spec.

	* interface.cs: Make all interface member classes derive from
	InterfaceMemberBase.

2001-05-07  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* Many things: all interfaces are parsed and generated in
	gen-treedump.  Support for member variables, constructors,
	destructors, properties, constants is there.

	Beginning of the IL backend, but very little done, just there for
	testing purposes. 

2001-04-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* cs-parser.jay: Fix labeled statement.

	* cs-tokenizer.cs (escape): Escape " and ' always.
	ref_line, ref_name: keep track of the line/filename as instructed
	by #line by the compiler.
	Parse #line.

2001-04-27  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* System.CodeDOM/CodeBinaryOperatorExpression.cs: Rearrange enum
	to match the values in System.CodeDOM.

	Divid renamed to Divide.

	* System.CodeDOM/CodeForLoopStatement.cs: Always have valid
	statements. 
	(Statements.set): remove.

	* System.CodeDOM/CodeCatchClause.cs: always have a valid
	statements. 

	* System.CodeDOM/CodeIfStatement.cs: trueStatements and
	falseStatements always have valid values. 

	* cs-parser.jay: Use System.CodeDOM now.
