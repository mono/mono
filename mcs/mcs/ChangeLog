	* driver.cs: Allow negative numbers as an error code to flag.

	* cs-parser.jay: Handle 1551.

	* namespace.cs: Add 1537 checking (repeated using alias namespaces).

2002-01-15  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* cs-parser.jay: Report 1518 (type declaration can only contain
	class, struct, interface, enum or delegate)

	(switch_label): Report 1523 (keywords `case' or `default' must
	preced code)

	(opt_switch_sections): Report 1522 (empty switch)

	* driver.cs: Report 1515 (response file specified multiple times)
	Report 1516 (Source file specified multiple times).

	* expression.cs (Argument.Resolve): Signal 1510

	(BaseAccess.Resolve, BaseIndexer.Resolve): Signal 1511 (base
	access not allowed in static code)

2002-01-11  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* typemanager.cs (IsPointerType): Utility method which we are going
	to need a lot.

	* ecore.cs (ImplicitReferenceConversion): A pointer type cannot be cast to
	the object type, so we take care of that.

	* expression.cs (FullMethodDesc): Also include the return type in descriptions.
	
	* support.cs (ParameterDesc): Fix minor bug which was causing params tags to be
	added to non-params parameters :-)

	* typemanager.cs (CSharpName): Include 'void' type too.	

	(void_ptr_type): Include in the set of core types.

	* ecore.cs (ConvertImplicit): Make use of ConvertImplicitStandard instead of 
	duplicating code.

	(ConvertImplicitStandard): Handle standard implicit pointer conversions when we have 
	an unsafe context.

	* cs-parser.jay (local_variable_pointer_type): Add support for 'void *' as I had 
	completely forgotten about it.

2002-01-10  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* cs-parser.jay (pointer_type): Add. This begins our implementation
	of parsing rules for unsafe code.

	(unsafe_statement): Implement.

	(embedded_statement): Modify to include the above.

	* statement.cs (Unsafe): Implement new class for unsafe blocks.

	* codegen.cs (EmitContext.InUnsafe): Add. This determines
	if the current context is an unsafe one.

	* cs-parser.jay (local_variable_pointer_type): Since local variable types
	are handled differently, we need separate rules for them.

	(local_variable_declaration): Update to use local_variable_pointer_type
	to allow variable declarations of unmanaged pointer types.

	* expression.cs (Unary.ResolveOperator): Ensure that the '&' operator is used only
	in unsafe contexts.

	* ../errors/cs0214.cs : Add.

2002-01-16  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* makefile: remove 'response' file when cleaning.

2002-01-15  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* cs-parser.jay: Report 1524.

2002-01-14  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* typemanager.cs (RegisterMethod): drop checking if we have
	registered this from here

2002-01-12  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* class.cs (Method.EmitDestructor): Implement calling our base
	destructor. 

	* statement.cs (Try.Emit): Fix to reset the InFinally to the old
	value of InFinally.

	* codegen.cs (EmitContext.EmitTopBlock): Destructors will call
	this routine and will wrap the call in a try/catch block.  Deal
	with the case.

2002-01-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* ecore.cs (Expression.MemberLookup): instead of taking a
	parameter `same_type' that was used to tell whether we could
	access private members we compute our containing type from the
	EmitContext.

	(FieldExpr): Added partial support for volatile fields.  This does
	not work for volatile fields exposed from assemblies, as I can not
	figure out how to extract the modreq from it.

	Updated all the source files to use this.

	* codegen.cs (EmitContext): Compute ContainerType ahead of time,
	because it is referenced by MemberLookup very often. 

2002-01-09  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* typemanager.cs (IndexerPropertyName): If we have a TypeBuilder, use
	TypeBuilder.GetCustomAttributes to retrieve what we need.

	Get rid of redundant default_member_attr_type as this is the same as
	default_member_type which already exists.

	* interface.cs, attribute.cs : Update accordingly.
	
2002-01-08  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* typemanager.cs: Enable IndexerPropertyName again.  It does not
	work for TYpeBuilders though.  Ravi, can you please fix this?

	* cs-tokenizer.cs: Accept _ as a name in pp-expressions.

	* expression.cs (Argument.Emit): Handle the case of ref objects
	being passed to ref functions;  

	(ParameterReference.EmitLoad): Loads the content of the pointer
	without dereferencing.

2002-01-07  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* cs-tokenizer.cs: Implemented the pre-processing expressions.

2002-01-08  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* class.cs (Indexer.DefineMethod): Incorporate the interface
	type in the name of the method if we are doing explicit interface
	implementation.

	* expression.cs (ConversionExists): Remove as it is completely obsolete.

	(BetterConversion): Fix extremely trivial bug where we were referring to
	ConversionExists instead of StandardConversionExists ! Hooray, things are fine
	again !

	* ../errors/bug16.cs : Add although we have fixed it.

2002-01-07  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (BaseIndexer): Begin implementation.

	* class.cs (TypeContainer.IsInterfaceMethod): Bug fix.

	* cs-parser.jay (indexer_declarator): Use qualified_identifier
	production directly to remove a shift/reduce, and implement
	explicit interface implementation.

	* cs-tokenizer.cs: Fix tokenizer, it was consuming one extra char
	after a floating point suffix.

	* expression.cs (DoNumericPromotions): Improved the conversion for
	uint/uint.  If we have a constant, we avoid doing a typecast to a
	larger type.

	* class.cs (Indexer): Implement explicit interface implementation
	for indexers.
	
Sat Jan 5 16:08:23 CET 2002 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* class.cs: make the default instance constructor public and hidebysig.

2001-01-03  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* interface.cs (EmitDefaultMemberAttr): Make this helper method static
	so we can call it from elsewhere.

	* class.cs (TypeContainer.Emit): Emit the attribute here too. The rule is that
	we emit it internally if the class has a defined indexer; otherwise the user
	emits it by decorating the class definition with the DefaultMemberAttribute.

	* attribute.cs (ApplyAttributes): Perform checks to see that the DefaultMember
	attribute is not used on a type which defines an indexer.

	* cs-tokenizer.cs (get_cmd_arg): Ensure we trim whitespace and also include the tab
	character when we skip whitespace.

	* ../errors/cs0646.cs : Add.

2002-01-03  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* ecore.cs (SimpleName.ResolveSimpleName): Report error 120
	again. 

	* makefile: Add practical target `mcs3.exe' which builds the third
	generation compiler. 

	* expression.cs (New): Fix structures constructor calling.

	* class.cs (Property, Method, Indexer): Emit Final flag on the
	method if we are an interface implementation and we are not
	abstract. 

	* ecore.cs (PropertyExpr): New public field `IsBase', tells
	whether this property is referencing a `base' method.

	* expression.cs (Invocation.EmitCall): take an extra argument:
	is_base, this is used to determine whether the `call' or
	`callvirt' opcode should be used.

	
	* delegate.cs: update EmitCall.

	* class.cs (Method.Define): Set NewSlot for the cases where we are
	not implementing an interface method.

	(Property.Define): ditto.

2002-01-02  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* cs-tokenizer.cs: (Tokenizer.escape): Escape '\r' as '\r' not as
	'r'.  Allows mcs to parse itself fully.

2002-01-02  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (ArrayCreation.num_automatic_initializers): Keep track
	of the number of initializers that require the InitializeArray method.

	(CheckIndices): Store the Expression in all cases - not the plain value. Also
	update the above field where necessary.

	(MakeByteBlob): Update accordingly.

	(DoEmit): Call EmitStaticInitializers only if the number of initializers is 
	greater than 2.

	(EmitDynamicInitializers): Update in accordance with the new optimization.

	(ArrayAccess.EmitStoreOpcode): Include char type along with short and ushort - the
	same OpCode applies.

	* cs-parser.jay : Fix some glaring errors I introduced.

2002-01-01  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com> 

	* parameters.cs (AddVariable, AddConstant): Pass in current_local_parameters
	so that we can check for name clashes there too.

	* typemanager.cs (default_member_attr_type): The attribute that we need to emit
	for interface indexers.

	* interfaces.cs (Define): Emit the default member attribute.

	* expression.cs (MakeByteBlob): Fix extremely trivial bug where the wrong
	variable was being referred to while setting the value ;-)

2002-01-01  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (MakeByteBlob): Optimize: we do not need to fill
	byte-by-byte information when we know the data is zero.

	Make the block always a multiple of 4, because
	DefineInitializedData has a bug.

	* assign.cs: Fix, we should assign from the temporary, not from
	the source. 

	* expression.cs (MakeByteBlob): Fix my incorrect code.

2001-12-31  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* typemanager.cs (EnumToUnderlying): This function is used to get
	the underlying type from an enumeration, because it does not
	always work. 

	* constant.cs: Use the I4_S form for values between -128 and 127.

	* statement.cs (Block.LookupLabel): Looks up a label.
	(Block): Drop support for labeled blocks.

	(LabeledStatement): New kind of statement that represents a label
	only.

	(Goto): Finally implement this bad boy.
	
	* cs-parser.jay: Update to reflect new mechanism to implement
	labels.

2001-12-30  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* codegen.cs (EmitContext.This): a codegen property that keeps the
	a single instance of this instead of creating many different this
	instances. 

	* delegate.cs (Delegate.DoResolve): Update to use the property;

	* ecore.cs (SimpleName.SimpleNameResolve): Ditto

	* expression.cs (BaseAccess.DoResolve): Ditto.

2001-12-29  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* typemanager.cs (methodimpl_attr_type): Add to hold the type
	corresponding to System.Runtime.CompilerServices.MethodImplAttribute.

	(InitCoreTypes): Update accordingly.

	* attribute.cs (Resolve): Remember if the attribute is a MethodImplAttribute
	so we can quickly store the state.

	(ApplyAttributes): Set the correct implementation flags
	for InternalCall methods.

2001-12-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (EmitCall): if a method is not virtual, then do
	not use callvirt on it.

	(ArrayAccess.EmitAssign): storing non-builtin value types (ie,
	user defined stuff) requires the use of stobj, which takes an
	address on the stack instead of an array and an index.  So emit
	the Ldelema operation for it.

	(EmitStoreOpcode): Use stobj for valuetypes.

	(UnaryMutator.EmitCode): Use the right 1 value depending on
	whether we are dealing with int64/uint64, float or doubles.

	* class.cs (TypeContainer.AddConstructor): Fix the logic to define
	constructors that I implemented last night.

	(Constructor.IsDefault): Fix to work properly for static
	constructors.

	* cs-parser.jay (CheckDef): report method signature errors.
	Update error number 103 to be 132.

	* decl.cs: New AdditionResult enumeration value: MethodExists.
	Although we do this check for methods later on in the semantic
	analysis, catching repeated default constructors is so easy that
	we catch these here. 
	
	* expression.cs (Binary.DoNumericPromotions): Fix the uint64 type
	promotions code.

	(ParameterReference.EmitAssign, Emit): handle
	bools as bytes.

	(ArrayAccess.EmitLoadOpcode): Handle bool type here.
	(ArrayAccess.EmitStoreOpcode): ditto.

	* cs-tokenizer.cs (is_punct): Eliminated empty computation.

	* expression.cs (MakeByteBlob): Complete all the missing types
	(uint, short, ushort, byte, sbyte)

	* class.cs: Only init instance field initializers on instance
	constructors. 

	Rename `constructors' to instance_constructors. 

	(TypeContainer.AddConstructor): Only add constructors to the list
	if it is not static.

	Make sure that we handle default_static_constructor independently
	everywhere where we handle instance_constructors

2001-12-28  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* class.cs: Do not lookup or create a base initializer for a
	static constructor.

	(ConstructorInitializer.Resolve): use the proper type to lookup
	for constructors.

	* cs-parser.jay: Report error 1585 (modifiers between type and name).

	* enum.cs, interface.cs: Remove CloseType, this is taken care by
	in DeclSpace. 

	* decl.cs: CloseType is now an virtual method, the default
	implementation just closes this type.
	
2001-12-28  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* attribute.cs (DefinePInvokeMethod): Set the implementation flags
	to PreserveSig by default. Also emit HideBySig on such methods.

	Basically, set the defaults to standard values.

	* expression.cs (Invocation.BetterFunction): We need to make sure that for each
	argument, if candidate is better, it can't be worse than the best !

	(Invocation): Re-write bits to differentiate between methods being
	applicable in their expanded form and their normal form - for params
	methods of course.

	Get rid of use_standard everywhere as only standard conversions are allowed
	in overload resolution. 

	More spec conformance.
	
2001-12-27  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* driver.cs: Add --timestamp, to see where the compiler spends
	most of its time.

	* ecore.cs (SimpleName.DoResolve): Do not create an implicit
	`this' in static code.

	(SimpleName.DoResolve): Implement in terms of a helper function
	that allows static-references to be passed upstream to
	MemberAccess.

	(Expression.ResolveWithSimpleName): Resolve specially simple
	names when called by MemberAccess to implement the special
	semantics. 

	(Expression.ImplicitReferenceConversion): Handle conversions from
	Null to reference types before others, as Null's type is
	System.Object. 

	* expression.cs (Invocation.EmitCall): Handle the special case of
	calling methods declared on a reference type from a ValueType
	(Base classes System.Object and System.Enum)

	(MemberAccess.Resolve): Only perform lookups on Enumerations if
	the left hand side is a TypeExpr, not on every enumeration. 

	(Binary.Resolve): If types are reference types, then do a cast to
	object on operators != and == of both arguments.
	
	* typemanager.cs (FindMembers): Extract instance and static
	members if requested.

	* interface.cs (PopulateProperty): Use void_type instead of null
	as the return type for the setter method.

	(PopulateIndexer): ditto.

2001-12-27  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* support.cs (ReflectionParameters): Fix minor bug where we
	were examining the wrong parameter for the ParamArray attribute.

	Cope with requests for the type of the parameter at position
	greater than the params parameter's. We now return the element
	type of the params array as that makes more sense.

	* expression.cs (Invocation.IsParamsMethodApplicable): Update 
	accordingly as we no longer have to extract the element type
	ourselves.

	(Invocation.OverloadResolve): Update.

2001-12-27  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* statement.cs (Foreach.GetEnumeratorFilter): Do not compare
	against IEnumerator, test whether the return value is a descendant
	of the IEnumerator interface.

	* class.cs (Indexer.Define): Use an auxiliary method to implement
	the other bits of the method definition.  Begin support for
	explicit interface implementation.

	(Property.DefineMethod): Use TypeManager.void_type instead of null
	for an empty return value.

2001-12-26  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (MemberAccess.ResolveMemberAccess): if we are
	dealing with a FieldExpr which is composed of a FieldBuilder, in
	the code path we did extract the constant, but we should have
	obtained the underlying value to be able to cast it (otherwise we
	end up in an infinite loop, this is what Ravi was running into).

	(ArrayCreation.UpdateIndices): Arrays might be empty.

	(MemberAccess.ResolveMemberAccess): Add support for section
	14.5.4.1 that deals with the special case of E.I when E is a type
	and something else, that I can be a reference to a static member.

	(ArrayCreation.MakeByteBlob): It is not an error to not be able to
	handle a particular array type to create byte blobs, it is just
	something we dont generate byteblobs for.

	* cs-tokenizer.cs (get_cmd_arg): Ignore \r in commands and
	arguments. 

	* location.cs (Push): remove the key from the hashtable that we
	are about to add.   This happens for empty files.

	* driver.cs: Dispose files after we have parsed them.

	(tokenize): new function that only runs the tokenizer on its
	input, for speed testing.

2001-12-26  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* class.cs (Event.Define): Define the private field only if there
	are no accessors defined.

	* expression.cs (ResolveMemberAccess): If there is no associated
	field with the event, that means we have an event defined with its
	own accessors and we should flag error cs0070 since transforming
	ourselves into a field is not valid in that case.

	* ecore.cs (SimpleName.DoResolve): Same as above.

	* attribute.cs (DefinePInvokeMethod): Set the default calling convention
	and charset to sane values.

2001-12-25  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* assign.cs (DoResolve): Perform check on events only if they 
	are being accessed outside the declaring type.

	* cs-parser.jay (event_declarations): Update rules to correctly
	set the type of the implicit parameter etc.

	(add_accessor, remove_accessor): Set current local parameters.

	* expression.cs (Binary): For delegate addition and subtraction,
	cast the return value from the method into the appropriate delegate
	type.

2001-12-24  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* typemanager.cs (RegisterDelegateData, GetDelegateData): Get rid
	of these as the workaround is unnecessary.

	* delegate.cs (NewDelegate.DoResolve): Get rid of bits which registered
	delegate data - none of that is needed at all.

	Re-write bits to extract the instance expression and the delegate method
	correctly.

	* expression.cs (Binary.ResolveOperator): Handle the '-' binary operator 
	on delegates too.

	* attribute.cs (ApplyAttributes): New method to take care of common tasks
	of attaching attributes instead of duplicating code everywhere.

	* everywhere : Update code to do attribute emission using the above method.

2001-12-23  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (IsParamsMethodApplicable): if there are not
	parameters, return immediately.

	* ecore.cs: The 0 literal can be implicity converted to an enum
	type. 

	(SimpleName.DoResolve): First lookup the type, then lookup the
	members. 

	(FieldExpr.Emit): If the InstanceExpression is a ValueType, we
	want to get its address.  If the InstanceExpression is not
	addressable, store the result in a temporary variable, then get
	the address of it.

	* codegen.cs: Only display 219 errors on warning level or above. 

	* expression.cs (ArrayAccess): Make it implement the
	IMemoryLocation interface.

	(Binary.DoResolve): handle the operator == (object a, object b)
	and operator != (object a, object b) without incurring into a
	BoxedCast (because 5 != o should never be performed).

	Handle binary enumerator operators.

	(EmitLoadOpcode): Use Ldelema if the object we are loading is a
	value type, otherwise use Ldelem_ref.

	Use precomputed names;

	(AddressOf): Implement address of

	* cs-parser.jay (labeled_statement): Fix recursive block
	addition by reworking the production.

	* expression.cs (New.DoEmit): New has a special case:
		
		 If we are dealing with a ValueType, we have a few
		 situations to deal with:
		
		    * The target of New is a ValueType variable, that is
		      easy, we just pass this as the variable reference
		
		    * The target of New is being passed as an argument,
		      to a boxing operation or a function that takes a
		      ValueType.
		
		      In this case, we need to create a temporary variable
		      that is the argument of New.


2001-12-23  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* rootcontext.cs (LookupType): Check that current_type is not null before
	going about looking at nested types.

	* ecore.cs (EventExpr.EmitAddOrRemove): Rename from EmitAssign as we do
	not implement the IAssignMethod interface any more.

	* expression.cs (MemberAccess.ResolveMemberAccess): Handle EventExprs specially
	where we tranform them into FieldExprs if they are being resolved from within
	the declaring type.

	* ecore.cs (SimpleName.DoResolve): Do the same here.

	* assign.cs (DoResolve, Emit): Clean up code considerably. 

	* ../errors/bug10.cs : Add.

	* ../errors/cs0070.cs : Add.

	* typemanager.cs : Use PtrHashtable for Delegate data hashtable etc.

	* assign.cs : Get rid of EventIsLocal everywhere.
	
2001-12-23  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* ecore.cs (ConvertIntLiteral): finished the implementation.

	* statement.cs (SwitchLabel): Convert the value we are using as a
	key before looking up the table.

2001-12-22  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* codegen.cs (EmitTopBlock): Require a Location argument now.

	* cs-parser.jay (constructor_declarator): We need to setup
	current_local_parameters before we parse the
	opt_constructor_initializer, to allow the variables to be bound
	to the constructor arguments.

	* rootcontext.cs (LookupType): First lookup nested classes in our
	class and our parents before we go looking outside our class.

	* expression.cs (ConstantFold): Extract/debox the values at the
	beginnning. 

	* rootcontext.cs (EmitCode): Resolve the constants first before we
	resolve the types.  This is not really needed, but it helps debugging.

	* statement.cs: report location.
	
	* cs-parser.jay: pass location to throw statement.

	* driver.cs: Small bug fix.

	* report.cs: Updated format to be 4-zero filled digits.

2001-12-22  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (CheckIndices): Fix minor bug where the wrong
	variable was being referred to ;-)

	(DoEmit): Do not call EmitStaticInitializers when the 
	underlying type is System.Object.

2001-12-21  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* ecore.cs (EventExpr.Resolve): Implement to correctly set the type
	and do the usual workaround for SRE.

	* class.cs (MyEventBuilder.EventType): New member to get at the type
	of the event, quickly.

	* expression.cs (Binary.ResolveOperator): Handle delegate addition.

	* assign.cs (Assign.DoResolve): Handle the case when the target
	is an EventExpr and perform the necessary checks.

	* ecore.cs (EventExpr.EmitAssign): Implement the IAssignMethod
	interface.

	(SimpleName.MemberStaticCheck): Include check for EventExpr.

	(EventExpr): Set the type in the constructor itself since we 
	are meant to be born fully resolved.

	(EventExpr.Define): Revert code I wrote earlier.
		
	* delegate.cs (NewDelegate.Resolve): Handle the case when the MethodGroup's
	instance expression is null. The instance expression is a This in that case
	or a null, depending on whether it is a static method or not.

	Also flag an error if the reference to a method is ambiguous i.e the MethodGroupExpr
	refers to more than one method.

	* assign.cs (DoResolve): Check whether the event belongs to the same Type container
	and accordingly flag errors.

2001-12-21  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* statement.cs (Throw.Emit): Add support for re-throwing exceptions.

2001-12-22  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* location.cs (ToString): Provide useful rutine.

2001-12-21  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* ecore.cs (Expression.ConvertIntLiteral): Do not return Constant
	objects, return the actual integral boxed.

	* statement.cs (SwitchLabel): define an ILLabel for each
	SwitchLabel. 
	
	(Switch.CheckSwitch): If the value is a Literal, extract
	the underlying literal.
	
	Also in the unused hashtable we had, add the SwitchLabel so we can
	quickly look this value up.

	* constant.cs: Implement a bunch of new constants.  Rewrite
	Literal based on this.  Made changes everywhere to adapt to this.
	
	* expression.cs (Expression.MakeByteBlob): Optimize routine by
	dereferencing array only once, and also copes with enumrations.

	bytes are two bytes wide, not one.

	(Cast): Perform constant conversions.
	
	* ecore.cs (TryImplicitIntConversion): Return literals instead of
	wrappers to the literals here.

	* expression.cs (DoNumericPromotions): long literals can converted
	to ulong implicity (this is taken care of elsewhere, but I was
	missing this spot).

	* ecore.cs (Expression.Literalize): Make the return type Literal,
	to improve type checking.

	* rootcontext.cs: Lookup for nested classes in our class hierarchy.

2001-12-20  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* literal.cs: Revert code from ravi that checked the bounds.  The
	bounds are sane by the definition of the type itself. 

	* typemanager.cs: Fix implementation of ImplementsInterface.  We
	need to actually look up in our parent hierarchy for interfaces
	implemented. 

	* const.cs: Use the underlying type for enumerations

	* delegate.cs: Compute the basename for the delegate creation,
	that should fix the delegate test case, and restore the correct
	Type Lookup semantics in rootcontext

	* rootcontext.cs: Revert Ravi's last patch.  The correct way of
	referencing a nested type with the Reflection API is using the "+"
	sign. 

	* cs-parser.jay: Do not require EOF token at the end.

2001-12-20  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* rootcontext.cs (LookupType): Concatenate type names with
	a '.' instead of a '+' The test suite passes again.

	* enum.cs (Enum.DefineEnum): Set RTSpecialName on the 'value__'
	field of the enumeration.

	* expression.cs (MemberAccess.ResolveMemberAccess): Add support for
	the case when the member is an EventExpr.

	* ecore.cs (EventExpr.InstanceExpression): Every event which is not
	static has an associated instance expression.

	* typemanager.cs (RegisterEvent): The usual workaround, now for events.

	(GetAddMethod, GetRemoveMethod): Workarounds, as usual.

	* class.cs (Event.Define): Register event and perform appropriate checks
	for error #111.

 	We define the Add and Remove methods even if the use provides none because
	in that case, we provide default implementations ourselves.

	Define a private field of the type of the event. This is done by the CSC compiler
	and we should be doing it too ;-)

	* typemanager.cs (delegate_combine_delegate_delegate, delegate_remove_delegate_delegate):
	More methods we use in code we generate.

	(multicast_delegate_type, delegate_type): Two separate types since the distinction
	is important.

	(InitCoreTypes): Update accordingly for the above.

	* class.cs (Event.Emit): Generate code for default accessors that we provide

	(EmitDefaultMethod): Do the job in the above.

	* delegate.cs (DefineDelegate): Use TypeManager.multicast_delegate_type in the 
	appropriate place.

2001-12-20  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* class.cs (Indexer.Define): Fix bug, we were setting both Get/Set
	builders even if we were missing one.

	* interface.cs, class.cs, enum.cs: When calling DefineNestedType
	pass the Basename as our class name instead of the Name.  The
	basename will be correctly composed for us.

	* parameter.cs (Paramters): Now takes a Location argument.

	* decl.cs (DeclSpace.LookupType): Removed convenience function and
	make all the code call directly LookupType in RootContext and take
	this chance to pass the Location information everywhere.

	* Everywhere: pass Location information.

2001-12-19  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* class.cs (Constructor.Define): Updated way of detecting the
	length of the parameters.

	(TypeContainer.DefineType): Use basename as the type name for
	nested types.

	(TypeContainer.Define): Do not recursively define types here, as
	definition is taken care in order by the RootContext.

	* tree.cs: Keep track of namespaces in a per-file basis.

	* parameter.cs (Parameter.ComputeSignature): Update to use
	DeclSpace. 

	(Parameters.GetSignature): ditto.

	* interface.cs (InterfaceMethod.GetSignature): Take a DeclSpace
	instead of a TypeContainer.

	(Interface.SemanticAnalysis): Use `this' instead of our parent to
	resolve names.  Because we need to be resolve in our context, not
	our parents.
	
	* driver.cs: Implement response files.

	* class.cs (TypeContainer.DefineType): If we are defined, do not
	redefine ourselves.
	
	(Event.Emit): Emit the code for add/remove handlers.
	(Event.Define): Save the MethodBuilders for add/remove.

	* typemanager.cs: Use pair here too.

	* cs-parser.jay: Replaced use of DictionaryEntry for Pair because
	DictionaryEntry requires the first argument to be non-null.  
	
	(enum_declaration): Compute full name for registering the
	enumeration.
	
	(delegate_declaration): Instead of using
	formal_parameter_list, use opt_formal_parameter_list as the list
	can be empty.

	* cs-tokenizer.cs (PropertyParsing): renamed from `properties'
	(EventParsing): New property that controls whether `add' and
	`remove' are returned as tokens or identifiers (for events);

2001-12-19  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* class.cs (Event.Define): Revamp use of EventBuilder completely. We now
	use MyEventBuilder only and let it wrap the real builder for us.

	(MyEventBuilder): Revamp constructor etc.

	Implement all operations that we perform on EventBuilder in precisely the same
	way here too.

	(FindMembers): Update to use the EventBuilder member.

	(Event.Emit): Update accordingly.

2001-12-18  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* class.cs (MyEventBuilder.Set*): Chain to the underlying builder
	by calling the appropriate methods.

	(GetCustomAttributes): Make stubs as they cannot possibly do anything
	useful.

	(Event.Emit): Use MyEventBuilder everywhere - even to set attributes.

2001-12-17  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* delegate.cs (Delegate.Populate): Check that the return type
	and various parameters types are indeed accessible.

	* class.cs (Constructor.Define): Same here.

	(Field.Define): Ditto.

	(Event.Define): Ditto.

	(Operator.Define): Check that the underlying Method defined itself
	correctly - so it's MethodBuilder should not be null.

	* delegate.cs (DelegateInvocation.DoResolve): Bale out if the type of the Instance
	expression happens to be null.

	* class.cs (MyEventBuilder): Workaround for SRE lameness. Implement various abstract
	members but as of now we don't seem to be able to do anything really useful with it.

	(FindMembers): Handle events separately by returning the MyEventBuilder of the event,
	not the EventBuilder.

2001-12-18  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* cs-tokenizer.cs: Add support for defines.
	Add support for #if, #elif, #else, #endif
	
	(eval_var): evaluates a variable.
	(eval): stubbed for evaluating functions.

	* cs-parser.jay: Pass the defines information

	* driver.cs: Add --define command line option.

	* decl.cs: Move MemberCore here.

	Make it the base class for DeclSpace.  This allows us to catch and
	report 108 and 109 for everything now.

	* class.cs (TypeContainer.Define): Extract all the members
	before populating and emit the warning 108 (new keyword required
	to override) instead of having each member implement this.

	(MemberCore.Define): New abstract method, we will be using this in
	the warning reporting engine in Populate.
	
	(Operator.Define): Adjust to new MemberCore protocol. 

	* const.cs (Const): This does not derive from Expression, it is a
	temporary object we use to create fields, it is a MemberCore. 

	* class.cs (Method.Define): Allow the entry point to be in a
	specific class.

	* driver.cs: Rewrite the argument handler to clean it up a bit.

	* rootcontext.cs: Made it just an auxiliary namespace feature by
	making everything static.

	* driver.cs: Adapt code to use RootContext type name instead of
	instance variable.

	* delegate.cs: Remove RootContext argument.

	* class.cs: (Struct, TypeContainer, Class): Remove RootContext
	argument. 

	* class.cs (Event.Define): The lookup can fail.
	
	* cs-tokenizer.cs: Begin implementation of pre-procesor. 

	* expression.cs: Resolve the this instance before invoking the code.

2001-12-17  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* cs-parser.jay: Add a production in element_access that allows
	the thing to become a "type" reference.  This way we can parse
	things like "(string [])" as a type.

	Note that this still does not handle the more complex rules of
	casts. 
	

	* delegate.cs (Delegate.Populate): Register the delegage constructor builder here. 

	* ecore.cs: (CopyNewMethods): new utility function used to
	assemble the list of methods from running FindMembers.

	(MemberLookup): Rework FindMembers so that 

2001-12-16  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* class.cs (TypeContainer): Remove Delegates who fail to be
	defined.

	* delegate.cs (Populate): Verify that we dont get null return
	values.   TODO: Check for AsAccessible.

	* cs-parser.jay: Use basename to emit error 574 (destructor should
	have the same name as container class), not the full name.

	* cs-tokenizer.cs (adjust_int): Fit the integer in the best
	possible representation.  

	Also implements integer type suffixes U and L.

2001-12-15  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (ArrayCreation.DoResolve): We need to do the
	argument resolution *always*.

	* decl.cs: Make this hold the namespace.  Hold the root context as
	well.
	(LookupType): Move here.

	* enum.cs, class.cs, interface.cs: Adapt to new hierarchy.

	* location.cs (Row, Name): Fixed the code, it was always returning
	references to the first file.

	* interface.cs: Register properties defined through interfaces.

	* driver.cs: Add support for globbing on the command line

	* class.cs (Field): Make it derive from MemberCore as well.
	(Event): ditto.

2001-12-15  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* class.cs (Event::Define): Check that the type of the event is a delegate
	type else flag error #66.

	Also, re-use TypeContainer.MethodModifiersValid here too as the rules are the
	same.

	* attribute.cs (DefinePInvokeMethod): Handle named arguments and process
	values of EntryPoint, CharSet etc etc.

	Pass in the values to TypeBuilder.DefinePInvokeMethod; determine Type etc neatly.

	* class.cs (FindMembers): If a method is in transit, its MethodBuilder will
	be null and we should ignore this. I am not sure if this is really clean. Apparently,
	there's no way of avoiding hitting this because the call is coming from SimpleName.DoResolve,
	which needs this to do its work.

	* ../errors/cs0066.cs : Add.

2001-12-14  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* typemanager.cs: (GetPropertyGetter, GetPropertyGetter): New
	helper functions.

	* class.cs: (MethodSignature.MethodSignature): Removed hack that
	clears out the parameters field.
	(MemberSignatureCompare): Cleanup

	(MemberCore): New base class used to share code between MethodCore
	and Property.

	(RegisterRequiredImplementations) BindingFlags.Public requires
	either BindingFlags.Instace or Static.  Use instance here.

	(Property): Refactored code to cope better with the full spec.

	* parameter.cs (GetParameterInfo): Return an empty array instead
	of null on error.

	* class.cs (Property): Abstract or extern properties have no bodies.

	* parameter.cs (GetParameterInfo): return a zero-sized array.

	* class.cs (TypeContainer.MethodModifiersValid): Move all the
	method modifier validation to the typecontainer so we can reuse
	this on properties.

	(MethodCore.ParameterTypes): return an empty sized array of types.

	(Property.Define): Test property modifier validity.

	Add tests for sealed/override too.

	(Method.Emit): abstract or extern methods have no bodies.

2001-12-14  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* class.cs (Method.IsPInvoke): Get rid of it as it is an expensive
	thing.

	(Method::Define, ::Emit): Modify accordingly.

	* expression.cs (Invocation::OverloadResolve): Handle error # 121.

	(ArrayCreation::MakeByteBlob): Handle floats and doubles.

	* makefile: Pass in /unsafe.

2001-12-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* class.cs (MakeKey): Kill routine.
	
	* class.cs (TypeContainer.Define): Correctly define explicit
	method implementations (they require the full interface name plus
	the method name).

	* typemanager.cs: Deply the PtrHashtable here and stop using the
	lame keys.  Things work so much better.

	This of course broke everyone who depended on `RegisterMethod' to
	do the `test for existance' test.  This has to be done elsewhere.

	* support.cs (PtrHashtable): A hashtable that avoid comparing with
	the object stupid Equals method (because, that like fails all over
	the place).  We still do not use it.

	* class.cs (TypeContainer.SetRequiredInterface,
	TypeContainer.RequireMethods): Killed these two routines and moved
	all the functionality to RegisterRequiredImplementations.

	(TypeContainer.RegisterRequiredImplementations): This routine now
	registers all the implementations required in an array for the
	interfaces and abstract methods.  We use an array of structures
	which can be computed ahead of time to reduce memory usage and we
	also assume that lookups are cheap as most classes will not
	implement too many interfaces.

	We also avoid creating too many MethodSignatures.

	(TypeContainer.IsInterfaceMethod): Update and optionally does not
	clear the "pending" bit if we find that there are problems with
	the declaration.

	(TypeContainer.VerifyPendingMethods): Update to report errors of
	methods that look like implementations but are not.

	(TypeContainer.Define): Add support for explicit interface method
	implementation. 
	
2001-12-12  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* typemanager.cs: Keep track of the parameters here instead of
	being a feature of the TypeContainer.

	* class.cs: Drop the registration of parameters here, as
	InterfaceMethods are also interface declarations.

	* delegate.cs: Register methods with the TypeManager not only with
	the TypeContainer.  This code was buggy.

	* interface.cs: Full registation here.

2001-12-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs: Remove reducer for binary expressions, it can not
	be done this way.

	* const.cs: Put here the code that used to go into constant.cs

	* constant.cs: Put here the code for constants, this is a new base
	class for Literals.

	* literal.cs: Make Literal derive from Constant.

2001-12-09  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* statement.cs (Return.Emit): Report error 157 if the user
	attempts to return from a finally block.

	(Return.Emit): Instead of emitting a return, jump to the end of
	the function.

	* codegen.cs (EmitContext): ReturnValue, ReturnLabel: new
	LocalBuilder to store the result of the function.  ReturnLabel is
	the target where we jump.
	

2001-12-09  Radek Doulik  <rodo@ximian.com>

	* cs-parser.jay: remember alias in current namespace

	* ecore.cs (SimpleName::DoResolve): use aliases for types or
	namespaces

	* class.cs (LookupAlias): lookup alias in my_namespace

	* namespace.cs (UsingAlias): add alias, namespace_or_type pair to
	aliases hashtable
	(LookupAlias): lookup alias in this and if needed in parent
	namespaces

2001-12-08  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* support.cs: 

	* rootcontext.cs: (ModuleBuilder) Made static, first step into
	making things static.  I need this to avoid passing the
	TypeContainer when calling ParameterType.

	* support.cs (InternalParameters.ParameterType): Remove ugly hack
	that did string manipulation to compute the type and then call
	GetType.  Use Parameter.ParameterType instead.

	* cs-tokenizer.cs: Consume the suffix for floating values.

	* expression.cs (ParameterReference): figure out whether this is a
	reference parameter or not.  Kill an extra variable by computing
	the arg_idx during emission.

	* parameter.cs (Parameters.GetParameterInfo): New overloaded
	function that returns whether a parameter is an out/ref value or not.

	(Parameter.ParameterType): The type of the parameter (base,
	without ref/out applied).
	
	(Parameter.Resolve): Perform resolution here.
	(Parameter.ExternalType): The full type (with ref/out applied).

	* statement.cs (Using.Emit, Using.EmitExpression): Implement
	support for expressions on the using statement.

2001-12-07  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* statement.cs (Using.EmitLocalVariableDecls): Split the
	localvariable handling of the using statement.

	(Block.EmitMeta): Keep track of variable count across blocks.  We
	were reusing slots on separate branches of blocks.

	(Try.Emit): Emit the general code block, we were not emitting it. 

	Check the type of the declaration to be an IDisposable or
	something that can be implicity converted to it. 

	Emit conversions if required.

	* ecore.cs (EmptyExpression): New utility class.
	(Expression.ImplicitConversionExists): New utility function.

2001-12-06  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* statement.cs (Using): Implement.

	* expression.cs (LocalVariableReference): Support read only variables.

	* statement.cs: Remove the explicit emit for the Leave opcode.
	(VariableInfo): Add a readonly field.

2001-12-05  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* ecore.cs (ConvCast): new class used to encapsulate the various
	explicit integer conversions that works in both checked and
	unchecked contexts.

	(Expression.ConvertNumericExplicit): Use new ConvCast class to
	properly generate the overflow opcodes.

2001-12-04  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* statement.cs: The correct type for the EmptyExpression is the
	element_type, not the variable type.  Ravi pointed this out.

2001-12-04  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* class.cs (Method::Define): Handle PInvoke methods specially
	by using DefinePInvokeMethod instead of the usual one.

	* attribute.cs (DefinePInvokeMethod): Implement as this is what is called
	above to do the task of extracting information and defining the method.
	
2001-12-04  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (ArrayCreation::EmitStaticInitializers): Get rid
	of the condition for string type.

	(Emit): Move that here. 

	(ArrayCreation::CheckIndices): Keep string literals in their expression
	form.

	(EmitDynamicInitializers): Handle strings appropriately.

2001-12-04  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* codegen.cs (EmitContext): Replace multiple variables with a
	single pointer to the current Switch statement.

	* statement.cs (GotoDefault, Switch): Adjust to cleaned up
	EmitContext.

2001-12-03  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* statement.cs 

	* statement.cs (GotoDefault), cs-parser.jay: Implement `goto
	default'.
	
	(Foreach.Emit): Foreach on arrays was not setting
	up the loop variables (for break/continue).

	(GotoCase): Semi-implented.
	
2001-12-03  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* attribute.cs (CheckAttribute): Handle system attributes by using

	(Method::Define): Set appropriate flags if we have a DllImport attribute.

	(Method::Emit): Handle the case when we are a PInvoke method.

2001-12-03  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* constant.cs (EmitConstant): Make sure we resolve the associated expression
	before trying to reduce it.

	that are user-defined by doing a LookupConstantValue on them.

	(SimpleName::DoResolve): When we have a FieldExpr, cope with constants
	too, like above.

2001-11-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (BaseAccess, BaseIndexer): Also split this out.

	(BaseAccess.DoResolve): Implement.

	ResolveMemberAccess routine that can be used independently

2001-11-28  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (Probe, Is, As): Split Probe in two classes Is and
	As that share bits of the implementation.  Is returns a boolean,
	while As returns the Type that is being probed.

2001-12-01  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* enum.cs (LookupEnumValue): Re-write various bits, return an object value
	instead of a Literal - much easier.

	(EnumInTransit): Remove - utterly useless :-)

	(Populate): Re-write bits - remove duplicate code etc. The code is much neater now.

	* expression.cs (MemberLookup): Cope with user-defined enums when they are in transit.

	* enum.cs (LookupEnumValue): Auto-compute next values by going down the dependency
	chain when we have no associated expression.

2001-11-30  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* constant.cs (Define): Use Location while reporting the errror.

	Also emit a warning when 'new' is used and there is no inherited
	member to hide.

	* enum.cs (EnumInTransit): Used to tell if an enum type is in the process of being 
	populated.

	(LookupEnumValue): Implement to lookup an enum member's value and define it
	if necessary.

	(Populate): Re-write accordingly to use the above routine.

2001-11-27  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (This): Fix prototype for DoResolveLValue to
	override the base class DoResolveLValue.

	* cs-parser.cs: Report errors cs574 and cs575 (destructor
	declarations) 

	* ecore.cs (FieldExpr.EmitAssign): Handle value types specially
	(we need to load the address of the field here).  This fixes
	test-22. 
	
	(FieldExpr.DoResolveLValue): Call the DoResolve
	function to initialize the Instance expression.
	
	* statement.cs (Foreach.Emit): Fix the bug where we did not invoke

	case we are a FieldExpr and a Literal, we are not being accessed
	by an instance reference.

	* cs-parser.jay (local_constant_declaration): Implement.

	(declaration_statement): Implement for constant declarations.

2001-11-26  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* statement.cs (Switch): Catch double defaults.

	implementation.  It works for integral values now, need to finish
	string support.


2001-11-24  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* ecore.cs (Expression.ConvertIntLiteral): New function to convert
	integer literals into other integer literals.  To be used by
	switch. 

2001-11-24  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (ArrayCreation): Get rid of ArrayExprs : we save
	some memory.

	(EmitDynamicInitializers): Cope with the above since we extract data
	directly from ArrayData now.

	(ExpectInitializers): Keep track of whether initializers are mandatory
	or not.

	(Bounds): Make it a hashtable to prevent the same dimension being 
	recorded for every element in that dimension.

	(EmitDynamicInitializers): Fix bug which prevented the Set array method
	from being found.

	Also fix bug which was causing the indices to be emitted in the reverse
	order.

2001-11-24  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (ArrayCreation): Implement the bits that Ravi left
	unfinished.  They do not work, because the underlying code is
	sloppy.

2001-11-22  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* cs-parser.jay: Remove bogus fixme.

	* statement.cs (Switch, SwitchSection, SwithLabel): Started work
	on Switch statement.
	
2001-11-23  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* typemanager.cs (IsDelegateType, IsEnumType): Fix logic to determine
	the same. 
	
	* expression.cs (ArrayCreation::CheckIndices): Get rid of the require_constant
	parameter. Apparently, any expression is allowed. 

	(ValidateInitializers): Update accordingly.

	(CheckIndices): Fix some tricky bugs thanks to recursion.

	* delegate.cs (NewDelegate::DoResolve): Re-write large portions as 
	I was being completely brain-dead.

	* expression.cs (ArrayCreation::Emit): Handle string initialization separately.

	(MakeByteBlob): Handle types more correctly.

	* expression.cs (ArrayCreation:Emit): Write preliminary code to do
	initialization from expressions but it is incomplete because I am a complete
	Dodo :-|

2001-11-22  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* statement.cs (If.Emit): Fix a bug that generated incorrect code
	on If.  Basically, we have to return `true' (ie, we do return to
	our caller) only if both branches of the if return.

	* expression.cs (Binary.Emit): LogicalOr and LogicalAnd are
	short-circuit operators, handle them as short circuit operators. 

	(Cast.DoResolve): Resolve type.
	(Cast.Cast): Take an expression as the target type.

	* cs-parser.jay (cast_expression): Remove old hack that only
	allowed a limited set of types to be handled.  Now we take a
	unary_expression and we resolve to a type during semantic
	analysis.

	Use the grammar productions from Rhys to handle casts (this is
	not complete like Rhys syntax yet, we fail to handle that corner
	case that C# has regarding (-x), but we will get there.

	that used to be done in local_variable_declaration here.

	* parameter.cs (Parameters.GetEmptyReadOnlyParameters): New
	function used to return a static Parameters structure.  Used for
	empty parameters, as those are created very frequently.

	* cs-parser.jay, class.cs: Use GetEmptyReadOnlyParameters

2001-11-15  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* parameter.cs, expression.cs, class.cs, ecore.cs: Made all
	enumerations that are used in heavily used structures derive from

	This is the kind of pre-optimzations that you should not do at
	home without adult supervision.

	-- separatedly from the other unary operators.  Cleans up the
	code, and kills the ExpressionStatement dependency in Unary.

	argument based on whether the method takes or not a `this' pointer
	(ie, the method is static).

	methods in RootContext, only ported to be part of TypeContainer.

	(TypeContainer::GetInterfaceOrClass): Ditto.

	(TypeContainer::LookupInterfaceOrClass, ::MakeFQN): Ditto.

	* rootcontext.cs: Deal with field-less struct types correctly now

	in order from base classes to child classes, so that we can in
	child classes look up in our parent for method names and
	attributes (required for handling abstract, virtual, new, override
	constructs: we need to instrospect our base class, and if we dont
	populate the classes in order, the introspection might be
	incorrect.  For example, a method could query its parent before
	the parent has any methods and would determine that the parent has
	no abstract methods (while it could have had them)).

	FieldInfos which are literals.

	(ConvertNumericExplicit, ImplicitNumericConversion): Fix a few
	type casts, because they were wrong.  The test suite in tests
	caught these ones.

	(ImplicitNumericConversion): ushort to ulong requires a widening
	cast. 

	Int32 constant to long requires widening cast as well.

	* literal.cs (LongLiteral::EmitLong): Do not generate i4 constants
	for integers because the type on the stack is not i4.

	* expression.cs (Binary::CheckShiftArguments): Add missing type
	computation.
	(Binary::ResolveOperator): Add type to the logical and and logical
	or, Bitwise And/Or and Exclusive Or code paths, it was missing
	before.

	(Binary::DoNumericPromotions): In the case where either argument
	is ulong (and most signed types combined with ulong cause an
	error) perform implicit integer constant conversions as well.

2001-09-28  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (UserImplicitCast): Method should always be
	non-null. 
	(Invocation::BetterConversion): Simplified test for IntLiteral.

	(Expression::ImplicitNumericConversion): Split this routine out.
	Put the code that performs implicit constant integer conversions
	here. 

	(Expression::Resolve): Become a wrapper around DoResolve so we can
	check eclass and type being set after resolve.

	(Invocation::Badness): Remove this dead function

	(Binary::ResolveOperator): Do not compute the expensive argumnets
	unless we have a union for it.

	(Probe::Emit): Is needs to do an isinst and then
	compare against null.

	(::CanConvert): Added Location argument.  If the Location argument
	is null (Location.Null), then we do not report errors.  This is
	used by the `probe' mechanism of the Explicit conversion.  We do
	not want to generate an error for something that the user
	explicitly requested to be casted.  But the pipeline for an
	explicit cast first tests for potential implicit casts.

	So for now, if the Location is null, it means `Probe only' to
	avoid adding another argument.   Might have to revise this
	strategy later.

	(ClassCast): New class used to type cast objects into arbitrary
	classes (used in Explicit Reference Conversions).

	Implement `as' as well.

	Reverted all the patches from Ravi below: they were broken:

		* The use of `level' as a mechanism to stop recursive
		  invocations is wrong.  That was there just to catch the
		  bug with a strack trace but not as a way of addressing
		  the problem.

		  To fix the problem we have to *understand* what is going
		  on and the interactions and come up with a plan, not
		  just get things going.

		* The use of the type conversion cache that I proposed
		  last night had an open topic: How does this work across
		  protection domains.  A user defined conversion might not
		  be public in the location where we are applying the
		  conversion, a different conversion might be selected
		  (ie, private A->B (better) but public B->A (worse),
		  inside A, A->B applies, but outside it, B->A will
		  apply).

		* On top of that (ie, even if the above is solved),
		  conversions in a cache need to be abstract.  Ie, `To
		  convert from an Int to a Short use an OpcodeCast', not
		  `To convert from an Int to a Short use the OpcodeCast on
		  the variable 5' (which is what this patch was doing).
	
2001-09-28  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (Invocation::ConversionExists): Re-write to use
	the conversion cache
	
	(Expression::ConvertImplicit): Automatic bailing out if level != 0. Also
	cache all conversions done, not just user-defined ones.

	(Invocation::BetterConversion): The real culprit. Use ConversionExists
	to determine if a conversion exists instead of acutually trying to 
	perform the conversion. It's faster too.

	(Expression::ConvertExplicit): Modify to use ConversionExists to check
	and only then attempt the implicit conversion.

2001-09-28  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (ConvertImplicit): Use a cache for conversions
	already found. Check level of recursion and bail out if necessary.

	* expression.cs (Conditional::Resolve, ::Emit): Implement ?:
	operator. 

2001-09-27  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* codegen.cs: remove unnneded code 

	* expression.cs: Removed BuiltinTypeAccess class

	Fix the order in which implicit conversions are
	done.  

	The previous fixed dropped support for boxed conversions (adding a
	test to the test suite now)

	(UserImplicitCast::CanConvert): Remove test for source being null,
	that code is broken.  We should not feed a null to begin with, if
	we do, then we should track the bug where the problem originates
	and not try to cover it up here.

	Return a resolved expression of type UserImplicitCast on success
	rather than true/false.  Ravi: this is what I was talking about,
	the pattern is to use a static method as a "constructor" for
	objects. 

	Also, do not create arguments until the very last minute,
	otherwise we always create the arguments even for lookups that
	will never be performed. 

	(UserImplicitCast::Resolve): Eliminate, objects of type
	UserImplicitCast are born in a fully resolved state. 
	
	* typemanager.cs (InitCoreTypes): Init also value_type
	(System.ValueType). 

	* expression.cs (Cast::Resolve): First resolve the child expression.

	(LValue): Add new method AddressOf to be used by
	the `&' operator.  

	Change the argument of Store to take an EmitContext instead of an
	ILGenerator, because things like FieldExpr need to be able to call
	their children expression to generate the instance code. 

	(Expression::Error, Expression::Warning): Sugar functions for
	reporting errors.

	(Expression::MemberLookup): Accept a TypeContainer instead of a
	Report as the first argument.

	(Expression::ResolvePrimary): Killed.  I still want to improve
	this as currently the code is just not right.

	(Expression::ResolveMemberAccess): Simplify, but it is still
	wrong. 

	(Unary::Resolve): Catch errors in AddressOf operators.

	(LocalVariableReference::Emit, ::Store, ::AddressOf): typecast
	index to a byte for the short-version, or the compiler will choose
	the wrong Emit call, which generates the wrong data.

	(ParameterReference::Emit, ::Store): same.

	(FieldExpr::AddressOf): Implement.
	
	* typemanager.cs: TypeManager: made public variable instead of
	property.
	
	* driver.cs: document --fatal.

	Error and Warning classes.

	the work of all the checking. 
	(ConvertImplicit): Call CanConvert and only then create object if necessary.
	(UserImplicitCast::CanConvert, ::Resolve): Re-write.

	(Unary::Operator): Rename Add and Subtract to Addition and Subtraction because
	that is the right way. 

	(Invocation::MakeUnionSet): Convenience function to make unions of sets for 
	overloading resolution. Use everywhere instead of cutting and pasting code.

	(Binary::ResolveOperator): Use MakeUnionSet.

	(UserImplicitCast::CanConvert, ::Resolve): Update to take care of the case when 
	we have to convert to bool types. Not complete yet.
	
2001-09-27  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* typemanager.cs (TypeManager::CSharpName): support ushort.

	* expression.cs (Expression::TryImplicitIntConversion): Attempts

	conversion (section 6.1.6).
	(Expression::ConvertImplicitRequired): Reworked to include

	(Expression::ConvertNumericExplicit): Finished.

	(Invocation::Emit): If InstanceExpression is null, then it means

	* expression.cs (Unary::Emit): Remove some dead code.
	(Probe): Implement Resolve and Emit for `is'.

	that tell whether is it possible to apply an implicit constant
	expression conversion.

	* class.cs (Operator): Update the operator names to reflect the
	ones that the spec expects (as we are just stringizing the
	operator names).
	
	* expression.cs (Unary::ResolveOperator): Fix bug: Use
	MethodInfo's ReturnType instead of LookupMethodByBuilder as the
	previous usage did only work for our methods.
	(Expression::ConvertImplicit): Handle decimal implicit numeric
	conversions as well.
	(Expression::InternalTypeConstructor): Used to invoke constructors
	on internal types for default promotions.

	(Unary::Emit): Implement special handling for the pre/post
	increment/decrement for overloaded operators, as they need to have
	the same semantics as the other operators.

	(Binary::ResolveOperator): ditto.
	(Invocation::ConversionExists): ditto.
	(UserImplicitCast::Resolve): ditto.
	
2001-09-26  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	after being emitted leaves a single value on the stack.

	* codegen.cs (EmitContext::EmitStatementExpression): Use the
	facilties of ExpressionStatement if possible.

	* cs-parser.jay: Update statement_expression.

2001-09-25  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* typemanager.cs: declare and load enum_type, delegate_type and
	void_type. 

	* expression.cs (Expression::Emit): Now emit returns a value that

	* codegen.cs (CodeGen::EmitTopBlock): Pass initial sequence

	* expression.cs:  Instead of having FIXMEs in the Resolve
	functions, throw exceptions so it is obvious that we are facing a
	bug. 

	* cs-parser.jay (invocation_expression): Pass Location information.

	* codegen.cs (CodeGen::Save, CodeGen::CodeGen, CodeGen::Basename):
	Use a basename for those routines because .NET does not like paths
	on them.

	* expression.cs (Unary::Resolve): Implement.

	Bind instance variable to Field expressions.
	(FieldExpr::Instance): New field used to track the expression that
	represents the object instance.
	(FieldExpr::Resolve): Track potential errors from MemberLookup not
	binding 
	(FieldExpr::Emit): Implement.

	* codegen.cs (EmitIf, EmitStatement, EmitBlock): Propagate whether
	the last instruction contains a return opcode to avoid generating
	the last `ret' instruction (this generates correct code, and it is
	nice to pass the peverify output).

	* class.cs (TypeContainer::EmitFieldInitializers): Implement field
	initializer for static and instance variables.
	(Constructor::Emit): Allow initializer to be null in the case of
	static constructors.  Only emit initializer for instance
	constructors.

	Also fix the code for the MemberTypes.Method branch, as it was not
	scanning that for operators (or tried to access null variables before).

	argument.

	deal with this by semantically definining it as if the user had
	done it.

	(TypeContainer::FindMembers): Removed ad-hoc hack to deal with
	constructors as we now "emit" them at a higher level.

	(TypeContainer::DefineDefaultConstructor): Used to define the
	default constructors if none was provided.

	(ConstructorInitializer): Add methods Resolve and Emit. 
	
	* expression.cs: Cast to ConstructorInfo instead of MethodInfo

2001-09-17  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* tree.cs (Tree::namespaces): New hashtable to keep track of namespaces
	in the source.
	(Tree::RecordNamespace): Method to do what the name says ;-)
	(Tree::Namespaces): Property to get at the namespaces hashtable.

	* cs-parser.jay (namespace_declaration): Call RecordNamespace to 
	keep track.

	* rootcontext.cs (IsNamespace): Fixed it :-)

2001-09-14  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* class.cs (TypeContainer::FindMembers): Add support for

	(MethodCore): New class that encapsulates both the shared aspects
	of a Constructor and a Method.

	Load System assembly as well as part of the standard library.

	* report.cs: Allow throwing exceptions on errors for debugging.

	* modifiers.cs: Do not use `parent', instead use the real type
	container to evaluate permission settings.

	* class.cs: Put Ravi's patch back in.  He is right, and we will
	have to cope with the

2001-09-14  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* modifiers.cs (TypeAttr, MethodAttr, FieldAttr): Map protected internal to
	FamORAssem, not FamANDAssem.
	
2001-09-14  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* driver.cs: Added --parse option that only parses its input files
	and terminates.

	* class.cs: Reverted last change from Ravi to IsTopLevel.  That is
	incorrect.  IsTopLevel is not used to tell whether an object is
	root_types or not (that can be achieved by testing this ==
	root_types).  But to see if this is a top-level *class* (not
	necessarly our "toplevel" container). 

2001-09-14  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* enum.cs (Enum::Define): Modify to call the Lookup method on the

2001-09-14  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* class.cs (TypeContainer::TypeAttr): Remove property code and move it into

	* class.cs (TypeContainer::IsTopLevel): Re-write. root_types doesn't seem to be the parent
	of top-level types as claimed.
	
2001-09-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* expression.cs (MemberLookup): Fruitless attempt to lookup

	mapping here.

	(TypeContainer::FindMembers): Use ArrayList and then copy an array
	of the exact size and return that.

	(Class::LookupMethodByBuilder): New function that maps
	MethodBuilders to its methods.  Required to locate the information
	on methods because System.Reflection bit us again.

	* support.cs: New file, contains an interface ParameterData and
	two implementations: ReflectionParameters and InternalParameters
	used to access Parameter information.  We will need to grow this
	as required.

	* expression.cs (Invocation::GetParameterData): implement a cache
	and a wrapper around the ParameterData creation for methods. 
	(Invocation::OverloadResolve): Use new code.

	(Populate): Iterate thru the indexers we have and define them too.
	(Indexer.GetMethodBuilder, .SetMethodBuilder): New members to hold the method builders

	* class.cs (Property): Revamp to use the convention of making fields readonly.

	information about indexer_declarator.
	(indexer_declarator): Implement actions.

	on Expression Classification.  Now all expressions have a method
	`Resolve' and a method `Emit'.

	* codegen.cs, cs-parser.jay: Fixed the bug that stopped code
	generation from working.     Also add some temporary debugging
	code. 
	
2001-08-24  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* codegen.cs: Lots of code generation pieces.  This is only the
	beginning, will continue tomorrow with more touches of polish.  We
	handle the fundamentals of if, while, do, for, return.  Others are
	trickier and I need to start working on invocations soon.
	
	* gen-treedump.cs: Bug fix, use s.Increment here instead of
	s.InitStatement. 

	* codegen.cs (EmitContext): New struct, used during code
	emission to keep a context.   Most of the code generation will be
	here. 

	* cs-parser.jay: Add embedded blocks to the list of statements of
	this block.  So code generation proceeds in a top down fashion.

2001-08-23  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* statement.cs: Add support for multiple child blocks.

2001-08-22  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	(Block::Block constructors): Link children. 
	(Block::Child): Child Linker.
	(Block::EmitVariables): Emits IL variable declarations.

	* class.cs: Drop support for MethodGroups here, delay until
	Semantic Analysis.
	(Method::): Applied the same simplification that I did before, and
	move from Properties to public readonly fields.
	(Method::ParameterTypes): Returns the parameter types for the
	function, and implements a cache that will be useful later when I
	do error checking and the semantic analysis on the methods is
	performed.
	(Constructor::GetCallingConvention): Renamed from CallingConvetion
	and made a method, optional argument tells whether this is a class
	or a structure to apply the `has-this' bit.
	(Method::GetCallingConvention): Implement, returns the calling
	convention. 
	(Method::Define): Defines the type, a second pass is performed
	later to populate the methods.

	(Constructor::ParameterTypes): implement a cache similar to the
	one on Method::ParameterTypes, useful later when we do semantic
	analysis. 

	(TypeContainer::EmitMethod):  New method.  Emits methods.

	* expression.cs: Removed MethodGroup class from here.
	
	* parameter.cs (Parameters::GetCallingConvention): new method.

	* class.cs (TypeContainer::Populate): Drop RootContext from the
	argument. 

	(Constructor::CallingConvention): Returns the calling convention.
	(Constructor::ParameterTypes): Returns the constructor parameter
	types. 
	
	(TypeContainer::AddConstructor): Keep track of default constructor
	and the default static constructor.

	(Constructor::) Another class that starts using `public readonly'
	instead of properties. 

	(Constructor::IsDefault): Whether this is a default constructor. 

	(Field::) use readonly public fields instead of properties also.

	(TypeContainer::TypeAttr, TypeContainer::AddConstructor): Keep
	track of static constructors;  If none is used, turn on
	BeforeFieldInit in the TypeAttributes. 

	* cs-parser.jay (opt_argument_list): now the return can be null
	for the cases where there are no arguments. 

	(constructor_declarator): If there is no implicit `base' or
	`this', then invoke the default parent constructor. 
	
	* modifiers.cs (MethodAttr): New static function maps a set of
	modifiers flags into a MethodAttributes enum
	(FieldAttr): renamed from `Map'.  So now we have FieldAttr,
	MethodAttr, TypeAttr to represent the various mappings where the
	modifiers are used.
	(FieldAttr): Map also `readonly' to `FieldAttributes.InitOnly' 	

2001-08-19  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* parameter.cs (GetParameterInfo): Fix bug where there would be no
	method arguments.

	* interface.cs (PopulateIndexer): Implemented the code generator
	for interface indexers.

2001-08-17  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* interface.cs (InterfaceMemberBase): Now we track the new status
	here.  

	(PopulateProperty): Implement property population.  Woohoo!  Got
	Methods and Properties going today. 

	Removed all the properties for interfaces, and replaced them with
	`public readonly' fields. 

2001-08-16  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* interface.cs (AddEvent, AddMethod, AddIndexer, AddProperty):
	initialize their hashtables/arraylists only when they are needed
	instead of doing this always.

	* parameter.cs: Handle refs and out parameters.

	* cs-parser.jay: Use an ArrayList to construct the arguments
	instead of the ParameterCollection, and then cast that to a
	Parameter[] array.

	* parameter.cs: Drop the use of ParameterCollection and use
	instead arrays of Parameters.

	(GetParameterInfo): Use the Type, not the Name when resolving
	types. 

2001-08-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* parameter.cs: Eliminate the properties Name, Type and ModFlags,
	and instead use public readonly fields.

	* class.cs: Put back walking code for type containers.

2001-08-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* class.cs (MakeConstant): Code to define constants.

	* rootcontext.cs (LookupType): New function.  Used to locate types 

	
2001-08-08  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* rootcontext.cs: OH MY!  My trick works!   It is amazing how nice
	this System.Reflection code is.  Kudos to Microsoft
	
	* typemanager.cs: Implement a type cache and avoid loading all
	types at boot time.  Wrap in LookupType the internals.  This made
	the compiler so much faster.  Wow.  I rule!
	
	* driver.cs: Make sure we always load mscorlib first (for
	debugging purposes, nothing really important).

	* Renamespaced things that were on `CSC' to `CIR'.  Maybe I should
	have moved to `CSC' rather than `CIR'.  Oh man!  The confussion!  

	* rootcontext.cs: Lookup types on their namespace;  Lookup types
	on namespaces that have been imported using the `using' keyword.

	* class.cs (TypeContainer::TypeAttr): Virtualize.
	(Class::TypeAttr): Return attributes suitable for this bad boy.
	(Struct::TypeAttr): ditto.
	Handle nested classes.
	(TypeContainer::) Remove all the type visiting code, it is now
	replaced with the rootcontext.cs code

	* rootcontext.cs (GetClassBases): Added support for structs. 

2001-08-06  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* interface.cs, statement.cs, class.cs, parameter.cs,
	rootcontext.cs, gen-treedump.cs, enum.cs, cs-parse.jay:
	Drop use of TypeRefs, and use strings instead.

2001-08-04  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* rootcontext.cs: 

	* class.cs (Struct::Struct): set the SEALED flags after
	checking the modifiers.
	(TypeContainer::TypeAttr): new property, returns the
	TypeAttributes for a class.  

	* cs-parser.jay (type_list): Oops, list production was creating a
	new list of base types.

	* rootcontext.cs (StdLib): New property.
	(GetInterfaceTypeByName): returns an interface by type name, and
	encapsulates error handling here.
	(GetInterfaces): simplified.
	(ResolveTree): Encapsulated all the tree resolution here.
	(CreateClass, GetClassBases, GetInterfaceOrClass): Create class
	types. 
	
	* driver.cs: Add support for --nostdlib, to avoid loading the
	default assemblies.
	(Main): Do not put tree resolution here. 

	* rootcontext.cs: Beginning of the class resolution.

2001-08-03  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* rootcontext.cs: Provide better error reporting. 

	* cs-parser.jay (interface_base): set our $$ to be interfaces.

	* rootcontext.cs (CreateInterface): Handle the case where there
	are no parent interfaces.
	
	(CloseTypes): Routine to flush types at the end.
	(CreateInterface): Track types.
	(GetInterfaces): Returns an array of Types from the list of
	defined interfaces.

	* typemanager.c (AddUserType): Mechanism to track user types (puts
	the type on the global type hash, and allows us to close it at the
	end). 
	
2001-08-02  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* tree.cs: Removed RecordType, added RecordClass, RecordStruct and
	RecordInterface instead.

	* cs-parser.jay: Updated to reflect changes above.

	* decl.cs (Definition): Keep track of the TypeBuilder type that
	represents this type here.  Not sure we will use it in the long
	run, but wont hurt for now.

	* driver.cs: Smaller changes to accomodate the new code.

	Call ResolveInterfaceBases, Call ResolveClassBases, Save assembly
	when done. 

	* rootcontext.cs (CreateInterface):  New method, used to create
	the System.TypeBuilder type for interfaces.
	(ResolveInterfaces): new entry point to resolve the interface
	hierarchy. 
	(CodeGen): Property, used to keep track of the code generator.

2001-07-26  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* cs-parser.jay: Add a second production for delegate_declaration
	with `VOID'.

	(enum_body): Put an opt_comma here instead of putting it on
	enum_body or enum_member_declarations so we can handle trailing
	commas on enumeration members.  Gets rid of a shift/reduce.
	
	(type_list): Need a COMMA in the middle.

	(indexer_declaration): Tell tokenizer to recognize get/set

	* Remove old targets.

	* Re-add the parser target.

2001-07-13  Simon Cozens <simon@simon-cozens.org>

	* cs-parser.jay: Add precendence rules for a number of operators
	ot reduce the number of shift/reduce conflicts in the grammar.
	
2001-07-17  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* tree.cs: moved IGenerator interface and renamed it to ITreeDump
	and put it here.

	Get rid of old crufty code.

	* rootcontext.cs: Use this to keep track of the parsed
	representation and the defined types available to the program. 

	* gen-treedump.cs: adjust for new convention.

	* type.cs: Split out the type manager, and the assembly builder
	from here. 

	* typemanager.cs: the type manager will live here now.

	* cil-codegen.cs: And the code generator here. 

2001-07-14  Sean MacIsaac  <macisaac@ximian.com>

	* makefile: Fixed up for easy making.

2001-07-13  Simon Cozens <simon@simon-cozens.org>

	* cs-parser.jay (rank_specifier): Remove a conflict by reordering
	the 

	(unary_expression): Expand pre_increment_expression and
	post_decrement_expression to reduce a shift/reduce.

2001-07-11  Simon Cozens

	* cs-tokenizer.cs: Hex numbers should begin with a 0.

	Improve allow_keyword_as_indent name.

2001-06-19  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* Adjustments for Beta2. 

2001-06-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* decl.cs: Added `Define' abstract method.
	(InTransit): new property, used to catch recursive definitions. 

	* interface.cs: Implement `Define'. 

	* modifiers.cs: Map Modifiers.constants to
	System.Reflection.TypeAttribute flags.

	* class.cs: Keep track of types and user-defined types.
	(BuilderInit): New method for creating an assembly
	(ResolveType): New function to launch the resolution process, only
	used by interfaces for now.

	* cs-parser.jay: Keep track of Classes, Structs and Interfaces
	that are inserted into the name space. 

2001-06-08  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* ARGH.  I have screwed up my tree so many times due to the use of
	rsync rather than using CVS.  Going to fix this at once. 

	* driver.cs: Objetify driver.  Load assemblies, use assemblies to
	load types.

2001-06-07  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* Experiment successful: Use System.Type rather that our own
	version of Type.  

2001-05-25  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* cs-parser.jay: Removed nsAliases from here.

	Use new namespaces, handle `using XXX;' 

	* namespace.cs: Reimplemented namespace handling, use a recursive
	definition of the class.  Now we can keep track of using clauses
	and catch invalid using clauses.

2001-05-24  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* gen-treedump.cs: Adapted for all the renaming.

	* expression.cs (Expression): this class now has a Type property
	which returns an expression Type.

	(Probe::, New::, TypeOf::, SizeOf::, Constant::): renamed from
	`Type', as this has a different meaning now in the base

2001-05-22  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* interface.cs, class.cs: Removed from all the sources the
	references to signature computation, as we can not do method
	signature computation during the parsing time, as we are not
	trying to solve at that point distinguishing:

	class X {
		void a (Blah x) {}
		void a (NS.Blah x) {}
	}

	Which depending on the context might be valid or not, as we do not
	know if Blah is the same thing as NS.Blah at that point.

	* Redid everything so the code uses TypeRefs now instead of
	Types.  TypeRefs are just temporary type placeholders, that need
	to be resolved.  They initially have a pointer to a string and the
	current scope in which they are used.  This is used later by the
	compiler to resolve the reference to an actual Type. 

	* DeclSpace is no longer a CIR.Type, and neither are
	TypeContainers (Class and Struct) nor Interfaces nor Enums.  They
	are all DeclSpaces, but no Types. 

	* type.cs (TypeRefManager): This implements the TypeRef manager,
	which keeps track of all the types that need to be resolved after
	the parsing has finished. 

2001-05-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* ARGH.  We are going to have to store `foreach' as a class rather
	than resolving it, as we need to verify error 1579 after name
	resolution.   *OR* we could keep a flag that says `This request to
	IEnumerator comes from a foreach statement' which we can then use
	to generate the error.

2001-05-10  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* class.cs (TypeContainer.AddMethod): we now add methods to the
	MethodGroup instead of the method hashtable.  

	* expression.cs: Add MethodGroup abstraction, which gets us one
	step closer to the specification in the way we handle method
	declarations.  

	* cs-parser.jay (primary_expression): qualified_identifier now
	tried to match up an identifier to a local variable reference or
	to a parameter reference.

	current_local_parameters is now a parser global variable that
	points to the current parameters for the block, used during name
	lookup.

	(property_declaration): Now creates an implicit `value' argument to
	the set accessor.

2001-05-09  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* parameter.cs: Do not use `param' arguments as part of the
	signature, per the spec.

2001-05-08  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* decl.cs: Base class for classes, structs and interfaces.  This
	is the "Declaration Space" 

	* cs-parser.jay: Use CheckDef for checking declaration errors
	instead of having one on each function.

	* class.cs: Factor out some code for handling error handling in
	accordance to the "Declarations" section in the "Basic Concepts"
	chapter in the ECMA C# spec.

	* interface.cs: Make all interface member classes derive from
	InterfaceMemberBase.

2001-05-07  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* Many things: all interfaces are parsed and generated in
	gen-treedump.  Support for member variables, constructors,
	destructors, properties, constants is there.

	Beginning of the IL backend, but very little done, just there for
	testing purposes. 

2001-04-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* cs-parser.jay: Fix labeled statement.

	* cs-tokenizer.cs (escape): Escape " and ' always.
	ref_line, ref_name: keep track of the line/filename as instructed
	by #line by the compiler.
	Parse #line.

2001-04-27  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* System.CodeDOM/CodeBinaryOperatorExpression.cs: Rearrange enum
	to match the values in System.CodeDOM.

	Divid renamed to Divide.

	* System.CodeDOM/CodeForLoopStatement.cs: Always have valid
	statements. 
	(Statements.set): remove.

	* System.CodeDOM/CodeCatchClause.cs: always have a valid
	statements. 

	* System.CodeDOM/CodeIfStatement.cs: trueStatements and
	falseStatements always have valid values. 

	* cs-parser.jay: Use System.CodeDOM now.
