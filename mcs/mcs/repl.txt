Things to do for the REPL support in MCS:

Documentation for the REPL mode for MCS can be found here:

	      http://mono-project.com/CsharpRepl

Apply the patch repl.patch to this directory, then either rebuild
Mono, or go to mcs and type:

      	make q
	make repl

* Mix statements with other top-level declarations.

	Currently we only process statements, but it would be useful
	to define classes, interfaces and structs inline.   

	These pose a problem, as the grammar conflicts on a few 
	elements like delegate (delegate declaration or anonymous
	method declration).

	To address this issue, I should build a mini-parser into
	repl.cs that does an initial pass at the input stream and
	determines with as many lookahead tokens as needed whether the
	text is regular toplevel declaration or our statement
	declaration.

	This would solve the grammar ambiguity that happens if we just
	allow both to be starting nodes.

* Implement auto-insert-semicolon

	This is easy to implement, just retry the parse with a
	semicolon, the question is whether this is a good idea to do
	in the first place or not.

* Tab Completion

	Implement tab completion on names, variables and type lookups.

	This could be implemented by having the TAB key force the
	expression to be evaluated with a special COMPLETE token
	at the end.

	Then the various productions (one by one) would have to
	add support for COMPLETE, and having Resolve methods be
	aware of this.
