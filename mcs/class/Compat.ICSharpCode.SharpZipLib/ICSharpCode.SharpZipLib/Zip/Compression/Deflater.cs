			* (2) A dictionary may be set only when we are in INIT_STATE, then
			*     we change the state as indicated.
			* (3) Whether a dictionary is set or not, on the first call of deflate
			*     we change to BUSY_STATE.
			* (4) -- intentionally left blank -- :)
			* (5) FINISHING_STATE is entered, when flush() is called to indicate that
			*     there is no more INPUT.  There are also states indicating, that
			*     the header wasn't written yet.
			* (6) FINISHED_STATE is entered, when everything has been flushed to the
			*     internal pending output buffer.
