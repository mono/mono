	/// This class allows us to retrieve a specified amount of bits from
	/// the input buffer, as well as copy big byte blocks.
	///
	/// It uses an int buffer to store up to 31 bits for direct
	/// manipulation.  This guarantees that we can get at least 16 bits,
	/// but we only need at most 15, so this is all safe.
	///
	/// There are some optimizations in this class, for example, you must
	/// never peek more then 8 bits more than needed, and you must first
	/// peek bits before you may drop them.  This is not a general purpose
	/// class but optimized for the behaviour of the Inflater.
