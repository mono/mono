	* Options.cs: Fix RemoveItem() and SetItem() so that removing by index
	  and using the numeric indexer work as expected.

	* Options.cs: Don't overly split option values, only split to obtain
	  the maximum number of desired values.  This better supports e.g. DOS
	  paths in multi-value values, e.g. '-DPATH=C:\tmp' would now create
	  the values {"PATH", "C:\tmp"} instead of {"PATH", "C", "\tmp"}.

	* Options.cs: "Code sharing": Use StringCodea.WrappedLines() from
	  Cadenza for the line wrapping algorithm.  (Only fitting as
	  WrappedLines() came from Mono.Options in the first place!)
	  Patch thanks to Federico Di Gregorio.

	* Options.cs: GetLineEnd() shouldn't skip the start character, as it
	  may contain '\n' (thus preventing the following text from being
	  properly indented).

	* Options.cs: Viktor Lundgren reported that Option.Description text of 
	  `"aaa." . "a" x 64` (that is, "aaa." followed by 64 "a"s) would cause 
	  GetLines() to go into an infinite loop and (eventually) die from an 
	  OutOfMemoryException.  Oops.  Fix this, simplify the logic, and turn 
	  GetLines() into an IEnumerable<string>.

	* Options.cs: Options.cs: Use the underlying target type in the error 
	  message, because "Could not convert string `' to type Nullable`1..." 
	  is not nearly as helpful as "Could not convert string `' to type 
	  Int32...".

2008-10-22  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* Option.cs: Add support for nullable types to Options.Parse<T>().
	  Namespace "harmonization" with NDesk.Options so that the same source 
	  file can be used in each project.

2008-10-13  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* ChangeLog: Started.
	* Options.cs: Added; Command line option parser.  A (renamed) copy of
	  NDesk.Options 0.2.1 (see git repo for prior history).
