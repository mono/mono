	* HttpListenerManager.cs : finish pending wait handle when closing
	  a listener. Fixed the issue on closing host/listener/channels.

	* HttpStandaloneChannelListener.cs
	  HttpStandaloneReplyChannel.cs
	  HttpStandaloneRequestContext.cs
	  HttpListenerManagerTable.cs
	  HttpChannelListenerEntry.cs
	  HttpContextInfo.cs
	  HttpListenerManager.cs :
	  Refresh implementation for HTTP channel listener in new namespace,
	  which works fine with throttling.

	  It still has some issue in closing channels or listeners, so it
	  does not replace existing implementation yet.
