	search for a case-insenstitive match too here.

2004-05-02  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	corresponding resource types.

2003-09-07  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Temporary workaround for bug 43567, so that Npgsql at least
	can run.

2003-05-06  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ResourceManager.cs: fixed infinite loop when the resource is not
	found. Also fixes bug #34196.

2003-05-04  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ResourceManager.cs: enabled the code that calls GetSatelliteAssembly
	and ignore the exception thrown if the assembly cannot be loaded.

2003-05-04  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ResourceManager.cs: fixed the name for the file when the culture is
	not de invariant culture. Commented out the GetSatelliteAssembly code
	to avoid NotImplementedException being thrown.

2002-08-19  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* ResourceWriter.cs: Implemented all methods

	* ResourceReader.cs: Cope with our ResourceSet class name, as well
	as theirs

2002-08-18  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* ResourceReader.cs: Finished basic implementation.  Some
	optimisation in conjunction with ResourceSet still possible though

2002-08-14  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* ResourceSet.cs: Throw the correct exceptions

	* ResourceManager.cs: Implemented all unfinished methods

2002-03-12  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* MissingManifestResourceException.cs: This should inherit from
	SystemException, not Exception.

2002-01-26  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ResourceReader.cs: Finsished reading resource files with just strings
	in them.  Need to figure out other types, and also resources with
	multiple types in the same file.

2002-01-24  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ResourceReader.cs: Implemented constructors. Started on the 
	GetEnumerator() method.  Not done yet, but comitting for 
	'disaster recovery' purposes.

2002-01-19  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* *.cs: Fixed indentation. There was a stupid bug in my .emacs file.

2002-1-17  Duncan Mak  <duncan@duncan@ximian.com>

	* ResourceSet.cs: Implemented GetObject (string, bool) and GetString
	(string, bool). ResourceSet has no more MonoTODOs! Also added in the
	Serializable attribute.
	
	* *.cs: convert to Miguel's brace style.

2002-01-17  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* ResourceManager.cs: Fixed GetNeutralResourcesLanguage () and added
	new attributes documented in 1.0 SDK.

2002-01-17  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* ResourceWriter.cs: Added MonoTODO decorations.

	* SatelliteContractVersionAttribute.cs: added new attributes in 1.0 SDK.

	* NeutralResoucesLanguageAttribute.cs: added new attributes in 1.0 SDK
	
2002-01-16  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* ResourceReader.cs: Fixed some typos.

	* ResourceManager.cs: After reading the tutorial from the SDK,
	finished all the ResourceManager constructors and removed those
	MonoTODO tags.
	
	Removed MonoTODO from GetNeutralResourcesLanguage (Assembly)
	because Miguel just implemented the whole class, including the
	constructor that I needed (CultureInfo (string)).

	Updated fields after reading the new docs from the final SDK.

	* ResXFileRef.cs, ResXResourceReader.cs: Removed. They are part of
	Windows.Forms and require System.Xml, which we don't have access to.

2002-01-13  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* ResourceManager.cs: Added more MonoTODOs and cleaned up some 
	indenting.

2002-01-09  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* ResourceManager.cs: Fixed the GetSatelliteContractVersion()
	method. It was missing a cast before. Removed MonoTODO
	attribute. ;-) It was tested by John Barnette, so this shouldn't break
	the build.

	* ResourceManager.cs: Removed MonoTODO attribute on GetString
	(string), as I believe it's correct. However, GetString
	(string, CultureInfo) is definitely broken, so I'm marking it with
	MonoTODO there. I also added MonoTODO to IntenalGetResourceSet().

2002-01-06  Duco Fijma <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>
	* Finalizing IResourceReader and IResourceWriter interfaces: 
          Added "new"-modifier to IResourceReader.GetEnumerator
	* Fixed compilation issues in other *.cs, so that the 
          System.Resources namespaces can be included in the corlib build.

2002-01-05  Ravi Pratap  <ravi@ximian.com>

	* ResourceManager.cs : MonoTODO attribute decoration.
	
Tue Dec 18 13:18:32 CET 2001 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* *.cs: fixed some of the compilation issues: missing
	using directives, typos.

2001-12-11  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* Checked in to CVS.

2001-12-10  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* ResourceManager.cs (GetNeutralResourcesLanguage):
	(GetSatelliteContractVersion): Implemented.

	* ResourceManager.cs: First attempt.

2001-11-27  Duncan Mak <duncan@ximian.com>

	* ResourceSet.cs:
	First attempt, can't continue until ResourceReader and ResourceWriter are implemented.
		
	* SatelliteContractVersionAttribute.cs: First attempt. The spec is quite amibiguous here.

	* NeutralResoucesLanguageAttribute.cs: Complete.

	* MissingManifestResourceException.cs: Complete.

	* IResourceReader.cs: Complete.

	* IResourceWriter.cs: Complete.
