	* ResourceManager.cs: After reading the tutorial from the SDK,
	finished all the ResourceManager constructors and removed those
	MonoTODO tags.
	
	Removed MonoTODO from GetNeutralResourcesLanguage (Assembly)
	because Miguel just implemented the whole class, including the
	constructor that I needed (CultureInfo (string)).

	Updated fields after reading the new docs from the final SDK.

	* ResXFileRef.cs, ResXResourceReader.cs: Removed. They are part of
	Windows.Forms and require System.Xml, which we don't have access to.

	* ResourceManager.cs: Added more MonoTODOs and cleaned up some 
	indenting.

	* ResourceManager.cs: Fixed the GetSatelliteContractVersion()
	method. It was missing a cast before. Removed MonoTODO
	attribute. ;-) It was tested by John Barnette, so this shouldn't break
	the build.

	* ResourceManager.cs: Removed MonoTODO attribute on GetString
	(string), as I believe it's correct. However, GetString
	(string, CultureInfo) is definitely broken, so I'm marking it with
	MonoTODO there. I also added MonoTODO to IntenalGetResourceSet().

	* Finalizing IResourceReader and IResourceWriter interfaces: 
          Added "new"-modifier to IResourceReader.GetEnumerator
	* Fixed compilation issues in other *.cs, so that the 
          System.Resources namespaces can be included in the corlib build.

	* *.cs: fixed some of the compilation issues: missing
