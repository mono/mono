	* ResourceManager.cs: Fixed the GetSatelliteContractVersion()
	method. It was missing a cast before. Removed MonoTODO
	attribute. ;-) It was tested by John Barn, so this shouldn't break
	the build.

	* Finalizing IResourceReader and IResourceWriter interfaces: 
          Added "new"-modifier to IResourceReader.GetEnumerator
	* Fixed compilation issues in other *.cs, so that the 
          System.Resources namespaces can be included in the corlib build.
