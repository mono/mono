	overridden to check for weak keys). Also ensured that no weak keys
	would be generated.

	* HashAlgorithm.cs: Changed the ComputeHash(Stream) method to (a) not
	allocate the whole stream memory (big memory saver as suggested by

	Length and Stream.Position because they aren't implemented for every
	stream class (similar issue to the CryptoStream patch).
	* MD5CryptoServiceProvider.cs: Moved a buffer allocation from 
	ProcessBlock to constructor to reduce memory allocation. Optimization
	suggested by Peter Williams in bugzilla entry #54024.

	with the class (Read/WriteByte, reading by non-multiple of the
	block size, using Stream.Length and Stream.Position ...).
	* SymmetricAlgorithm.cs: Return an empty array when there's nothing
	to return (required for CryptoStream to work).

2004-01-31  David Sheldon      <dave-mono@earth.li>

	* FromBase64Transform.cs: Removed needless catch and rethrow.

2004-01-31  David Sheldon      <dave-mono@earth.li>

	* FromBase64Transform.cs: Fixes to what happens if a character in the
	input stream is not in the lookup table. IndexOutOfRangeException was 
	wrong.

2003-12-15  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* CryptoConfig.cs: Now use internal Environment.GetMachineConfigPath()
	to find machine.config.	Initialization removed from static constructor

	(like MS does but unlike MS documents).

2003-03-28  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	algorithm names documented in book ".NET Framework Security".

2003-02-03  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* PasswordDeriveBytes.cs: Finally got the derivation right. The

	* RSAPKCS1SignatureDeformatter.cs: No need to create the hash object
	in this class - the OID is enough.

2003-02-01  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

2003-01-05  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* CryptoAPITransform.cs: Removed all TODO. This class will not be
