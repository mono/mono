2003-03-03  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	keysize is a constructor parameter (major speed improvment when
	importing keys). Removed NotSupportedException when CspParameter is
	used in constructor (required for forthcoming security tools).

2003-02-08  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* Changes to refer Mono.Math and Mono.Security.Cryptography
	* Changes to refer Mono.Xml

2003-02-04  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	(limited to algorithms, not OIDs). Modified CreateFromName to use
	the fully qualified class names (and removed xmldsig hack). Added
	algorithm names documented in book ".NET Framework Security".

2003-02-03  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* PasswordDeriveBytes.cs: Finally got the derivation right. The
	class can now derive keys up to 1000 * HashSize (same limit as MS).
	* RSAPKCS1SignatureDeformatter.cs: No need to create the hash object
	in this class - the OID is enough.

2003-02-01  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* AsymmetricSignatureFormatter.cs: Call abstract SetHashAlgorithm
	when CreateSignature(hash) is called.
	* CryptoStream.cs: Fixed some issues in constructor.
	* DSACryptoServiceProvider.cs: Fixed a bug (1 chance in 256) that

	null).

2003-01-09  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* RNGCryptoServiceProvider.cs: Changed methods interacting with 
	the runtime as Internal<MethodName>. This will allow to make the
	class Windows-compatible by doing a switch at runtime.

2003-01-05  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* CryptoAPITransform.cs: Removed all TODO. This class will not be
	used by Mono. MS uses it with <algo>CryptoServiceProvider classes 
	to provide a common ICryptoTransform access to CryptoAPI. 

2003-01-03  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* RC2CryptoServiceProvider.cs: Now about 2 time faster by inlining 
	methods and changing to UInt16 (instead of UInt32). 

2003-01-02  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* RijndaelManaged.cs: Now 7 (encrypt) to 10 (decrypt) times faster

	* CryptoAPITransform.cs: Removed "= false" assignation from a private
	member (because this created an unwanted "ghost" constructor) and 
	modified Dispose declaration.
	* HashAlgorithm.cs: Removed destructor. Disposing unmanaged 
	ressources is the responsability of each class (not an abstract class).
	* RSAPKCS1SignatureDeformatter.cs: Removed a VerifySignature method
	which was present in the base class AsymmetricSignatureDeformatter.
	* RSAPKCS1SignatureFormatter.cs: Removed a CreateSignature method
