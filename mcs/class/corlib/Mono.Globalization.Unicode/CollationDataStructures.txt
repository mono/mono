* Collation Data structure and code


** General

	I will create a code generator named "collation-builder" (currently
	create-mscompat-collation-table.cs), which creates collation support
	source files:

	- collation-tables.h : C header that holds raw constant arrays
	- CollationTable.cs : C# source that declares raw constant arrays

	The latter one is totally optional. It is created just for ease of
	debugging in pure managed world.

	CollationSource class is used to represent a culture-specific collation
	resource set.



** Manual tasks required to maintain the source.

	We should always pay attention to the contants for CodePointIndexer
	that is likely not be in sync with the constant arrays.



** collation-tables.h

	typedef struct {
		ushort lcid;
		ushort tailoringIndex;
		ushort tailoringCount;
		short reverseAccentOrder; /* 1:French sort. 0:Normal */
	} CollationSource;

	Those [*] characters will be compressed using CodePointIndexer
	whose max value is char.MaxValue+1.

	// Holds sortkey basis.
	byte [*] category;
	byte [*] level1;
	byte [*] level2;
	byte [*] level3;
	char [*] widthCompat;

	// Holds special arrays for CJK order which is culture dependent.
	ushort [*] cjkCHS;
	ushort [*] cjkCHT;
	ushort [*] cjkJA;
	ushort [*] cjkKO;
	byte [*] cjkKOlv2;
	char [whole_tailoring_count] tailorings;
	CollationSource [culture_count] collationSources;



** CollatorSource.cs

	static byte [*] category;
	static byte [*] level1;
	static byte [*] level2;
	static byte [*] level3;
	static char [*] widthCompat;
	static CodePointIndexer category;
	static CodePointIndexer level1;
	static CodePointIndexer level2;
	static CodePointIndexer level3;
	static CodePointIndexer widthCompat;
	static char [] tailorings;
	static ushort [] cjkCHS;
	static ushort [] cjkCHT;
	static ushort [] cjkJA;
	static ushort [] cjkKO;
	static byte [] cjkKOlv2;
	static CodePointIndexer [] cjkIndexer;

	class CollationSource
	{
		// Primary constants
		int tailoringIndex;
		int tailoringCount;
		bool reverseAccentOrder;

		// This array is set according to CJK type, and CJK type
		// will be hardcoded, being identified from LCID.
		ushort [] cjk;

		// For Korean, level2 table is specially treated.

		// Computed values for optimization in use.
		byte [*] hasTailoringHead;
		byte [*] hasTailoringTail;
	}
