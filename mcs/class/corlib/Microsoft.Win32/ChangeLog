2010-07-11  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* RegistryKey.cs: Add 4.0 CreateSubKey overloads taking a RegistryOptions
	parameter.
	* IRegistryApi.cs: Add a new overload for CreateSubKey for the 4.0
	profile. Not nice, but better than to change the signature for each
	profile.
	* Win32RegistryApi.cs: Properly recognize a handle where a volatile
	key is requested.
	* UnixRegistryApi.cs: Stubbed.

2010-07-09  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Win32RegistryApi.cs: Use RegCreateKeyEx instead of RegCreateKey, as
	we need it to further support both the missing bits and the 4.0
	features.

2010-02-08  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* UnixRegistryApi.cs: When retrieving the registry keys from file in a
	unix system, if the value returned by a SecurityElement is null,
	use String.Empty, since at this point we know that this registry key
	*exists* and *cannot* have a null value, as specified in the public
	api.
	Fixes #543206.

2009-11-21  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* RegistryKey.cs: Implement a GetValueKind and a handful of
	methods. 

2009-04-25  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* *.cs: Exclude the files for the NET_2_1 profile, since they are
	unneeded and adds a bunch (23) [SecuritySafeCritical] to audit for
	Moonlight

2008-02-25  Robert Jordan  <robertj@gmx.net>

	* Win32RegistryApi.cs (ToString): Don't emit the handle value
	under NET_2_0.
	See http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa497241.aspx.

2008-02-01  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* RegistryKey.cs: Added missing checks on length of subkey and value
	names. On 2.0 profile, allow subkey <= 255 characters. Modified
	ArgumentNullException argument names to match MS.
	* UnixRegistryApi.cs: In SetValue (string, object, RegistryValueKind),
	use a zero-length string for name if it is null. In OpenSubKey,
	respect value of writable argument when creating well-known subkey.
	Fixes bug #357883. Removed argument names for ArgumentException's to
	match MS.

2008-01-15  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@gmail.com>

	* RegistryKey.cs: Fix some argument names to be consistent with MS.

2007-10-13  kevin.fitzgerald@soarce.us

	* UnixRegistryApi.cs: Escape the strings before passing them to
	SecurityElement.   This fixes bug #322839

2007-08-30  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* UnixRegistryApi.cs: properly retrieve values of type
	'bytearray'.

2007-08-13  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* RegistryKeyPermissionCheck.cs: Do not include in 1.0 profile.
	Removed extra using directive and empty lines.

2007-05-01  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* RegistryKeyPermissionCheck.cs: Not serializable

2007-04-30  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Registry.cs: 
	* RegistryHive.cs: 
	* RegistryKey.cs: 
	* RegistryValueKind.cs: 
	* RegistryKeyPermissionCheck.cs: Updated for 2.0 profile

2006-10-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* UnixRegistryApi.cs (KeyHandler.MachineStore): Add support for
	loading/storing values from the system registry, instead of having
	the system ones be user-based. 

	(KeyHandler, Load): turn IO exceptions into Security exceptions.

2006-09-03  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* IRegistryApi.cs: Added OpenRemoteBaseKey method.
	* Win32ResultCode.cs: Added code for win32 error 53.
	* RegistryKey.cs: Implemented support for OpenRemoteBaseKEy on
	Windows. To achieve this, the handle of the remote hive must be
	stored separately from the RegistryHive value. Removed isRoot field, as
	we now determine whether we're a root key (hive) by checking if hive
	is not null. Added internal ctor for registry hives that takes a 
	RegistryHive, a key handle and a bool to indicate whether its a remote
	hive. Renamed Data field to handle and added internal property to 
	access it. Throw ObjectDisposedException in ToString if key is
	closed/disposed. Added Hive property, which is used in UnixRegistryApi.
	Added GetHiveName method which translates a RegistryHive value to its
	(key) name.
	* Win32RegistryApi.cs: Added pinvoke for RegConnectRegistry. GetHandle
	no longer needs to know whether the key refers to a hive (base key) 
	or not. Implemented OpenRemoteBaseKey.
	* UnixRegistryApi.cs: Added OpenRemoteBaseKey implementation which
	always throws NotImplementedException.
	* Registry.cs: The key name of the base key no longer needs to be 
	passed to the ctor, as it's looked up in the ctor itself. This avoids
	having a different logical for local or remote base keys.

2006-08-23  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Win32RegistryApi.cs: Use a StringBuilder instead of byte [] for
	RegEnumKey. Fixed issue in GetSubKeyNames where buffer was not cleared
	while iterating over subkeys.

2006-08-20  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* RegistryValueOptions.cs: Add the real one.

2006-08-20  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* RegistryValueOptions.cs : build fix, easier than reverting all.

2006-08-20  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* IRegistryApi.cs: Modified GetValue to take RegistryValueOptions enum
	and removed obsolete return_default_value argument.
	* RegistryKey.cs: Added missing ComVisible attribute on SetValue.
	Use new GetValue method on IRegistryApi that takes RegistryValueOptions
	enum. Added GetValue overload that takes RegistryValueOptions (2.0).
	* Win32RegistryApi.cs: Modified GetValue to take RegistryValueOptions
	enum, and removed obsolete returnDefaultValue argument. Added support
	for ExpandString value type. Do no expand if DoNotExpand... is set.
	* UnixRegistryApi.cs: Modified KeyHandler.GetValue to take
	RegistryValueOptions enum, and do no expand environment variables in
	an ExpandString if DoNotExpandEnvironmentNames is set. Modified
	UnixRegistryApi.GetValue to take RegistryValueOptions enum, and 
	removed obsolete return_default_value argument.

2006-08-14  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* UnixRegistryApi.cs: Undo change for new eventlog implementation that
	was not rolled back earlier this week, and which does not make sense
	without that implementation anyway.

2006-08-14  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Win32ResultCode.cs: Added error code for attempting to perform an
	operation on registry key that is marked for deletion.
	* RegistryKey.cs: Keep writable state. Automatically flush changes to
	disk when closing key (to match MS). Allow values to be set on root
	keys. Throw UnauthorizedAccessException when attempting to set/delete
	value or create/delete sub key on registry key that is openen 
	read-only. Fixed DecodeString to only strip trailing nullchars (as
	documented).
	* Win32RegistryApi.cs: For a key that is marked for deletion, return
	null when attempting to get a value of that key (and no default value
	was specified) or open a subkey. Throw an IOException when attempting
	to perform the following operation on a key that is marked for
	deletion:
		1) set value on key
	 	2) obtain SubKeyCount
		3) obtain ValueCount
		4) create a sub key
		5) obtain value names
	and ignore deleting a value. Ignore flushing changes of a key and
	closing a when the key is closed.
	* UnixRegistryApi.cs: Maintain handler cache per directory instead of
	caching registry keys. This allows both a single key to be in memory
	in both read-only and read-write key configuration, while sharing the
	KeyHandler. Use case-insensitive hashtable for mapping directory to
	KeyHandler. Added support for keys that have been marked for deletion
	by another operation (eg. DeleteSubKeyTree). Allow different file store
	for machine-level and user-level hives (but have them use the same
	file store, needs further discussion). Allow KeyHandler failure when
	create directory, or saving values file to bubble up. Do not save
	values file when key is marked for deletion. Encapsulate access to
	values collection. When setting value with null name, use zero-length
	name instead. Treat key name case-insensitive in DeleteKey to match
	OpenSubKey.

2006-08-14  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* RegistryValueKind.cs: Make this public in 2.0, and rename from
	previous version.

	* Win32RegistryApi.cs: Include version to check for version;
	Eliminate old internal enum, and instead use the new 2.0 enum.

	* UnixRegistryApi.cs: Add support for typed versions of values.

	Add support for ExpandString.

	* Registry.cs (SetValue): implement version with type arguments.

2006-08-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Registry.cs (SetValue, GetValue): implement.

	* UnixRegistryApi.cs (KeyHandler.LoadKey, KeyHandler.Save): Add
	support for qwords.

	(KeyHandler.Save): Do not save the entries if they have been
	deleted/dropped.   Fixes a crash.

	(UnixRegistryApi.DeleteKey): bug fix, call ToUnix on the keyname.

2006-08-12  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Registry.cs: Fixed copy/paste bug.

2006-08-11  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* UnixRegistryApi.cs: Consider HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\
	EventLog a wellknown key. Required for new EventLog implementation. 
	Added RegistryStore property.

2006-06-06  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* UnixRegistryApi.cs: Do not crash if there are no values stored.

2006-05-28  Gert Driesen <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* UnixRegistryApi.cs: GetSubKeyNames returns only names of subkeys,
	not the qualified name. Fixes bug #78519.

2006-04-20  Gert Driesen <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* UnixRegistryApi.cs: In KeyHandler.SetValue, immediately convert
	instances of non-native registry types (meaning int, string, string[]
	or byte[]) to string. This avoids returning an instance of a non-native
	registry type in calls to UnixRegistryApi.GetValue. Allow instances of
	non-native registry types in UnixRegistryApi.SetValue. Fixes bug #78132.

2006-04-18  Gert Driesen <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* UnixRegistryApi.cs: Only consider the "software" subkey a well-known
	key if the parent is either HKEY_USERS or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

2006-04-15  Robert Jordan <robertj@gmx.net>

	* UnixRegistryApi.cs (DeleteValue): Avoid crash, fixes bug
	#77772. Patch reapplied, since r57881 was not applied correctly.
	
2006-04-13 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* UnixRegistryApi.cs: create well-known keys when trying to open them.

2006-03-12  Robert Jordan <robertj@gmx.net>

	* UnixRegistryApi.cs (DeleteValue): Avoid crash, fixes bug
	#77772

2006-01-14  Robert Jordan  <robertj@gmx.net>

	* RegistryKey.cs: Added internal IsRoot accessor.
	* Win32RegistryApi.cs: Fixed access to RegistryKey.Data.
	Fixes bug #77212. Thanks to Don Edvalson (don@edvalson.net)
	for spotting this out.

2005-12-02  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Win32RegistryApi.cs : fixed invalid cast. Now mono is not to blame
	  for not being able to run NAnt on Windows.
	
2005-11-12  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* RegistryKey.cs: Add support for a Registry on Unix based on
	files under ~/.mono/registry.

	Vastly refactored the code, reworked the interface between the
	frontend and the backends.  

	If "RegistryKey" was not sealed, things could have been a lot
	cleaner. 

2005-01-31  mei (mei@work.email.ne.jp)

	* RegistryKey.cs: Fixes bug 70451: When the key doesn't exist, and
	the default value is not specified, it is necessary to return
	null. and DecodeString function's bug is fixed.

2004-04-10  Gert Driesen (driesen@users.sourceforge.net)

	* RegistryKey.cs: explicit implementation of IDisposable to match 
	MS corlib

	registry. Patch  by Erik LeBel.
	* IRegistryApi.cs: New file - Interface to a registry backend
	(win32 on windows, no implementation on unix). This interface will
	probably change when we write a Linux backend.

	check pinvoke. Patch by Erik LeBel.
	* Registry.cs: Create the keys. Patch by Erik LeBel.
