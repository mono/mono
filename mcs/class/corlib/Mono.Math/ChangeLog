	* BigInteger.cs: Added Clear to zeroize big integers and code to allow
	compares with null (because operators == and != are re-defined). Note:
	The class may still leak some private info in temp arrays (thanks Ben).

	* BigInteger.cs: New, much faster, version by Ben Maurer. 
	Warning: this version requires "unsafe" compilation switch
	(which isn't a problem in corlib but may be elsewhere)

	* BigInteger.cs: Renamed namespace to match new location.
