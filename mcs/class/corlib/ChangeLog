	* corlib.build: Put the linux target at the top.  I keep changing the 
	build for windows 'cause it's at the top.  Then when I do make, nothing
	changes.  It seems like it always takes me half a day to remember
	that the linux target comes second.  Old age I guess.

	* ChangeLog: Add the change log to this directory

	* corlib.build: Add dependancy on linux target to test target. Need to have the dll before we can test it, right?  Plus is encourages other to try 'make test'.
