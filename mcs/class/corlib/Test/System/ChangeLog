2003-01-28  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

        * ArrayTest.cs: Avoid nulls in arrays. This crashes mono.
        * ConsoleTest.cs: Ignore some tests that hang mono.
        * ConvertTest.cs: Ignore some tests that hang mono.

2003-01-27  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* StringTest.cs: Added tests for out-of-bounds indexes in GetChars().

2003-01-13  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* DateTimeTest.cs: Use 2003, since that' the year now.  Need to work
	on this test so we don't have it fail each new year.

2002-12-21  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* all: make tests build and run under nunit2

2002-11-13  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* StringTest.cs: added 1 more check.

2002-10-29  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* EnumTest.cs: Added tests for whitespaces in Enum:Parse().

2002-10-16  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* EnumTest.cs: Find out which Assert is causing the error on mono.

2002-10-09  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* BufferTest.cs: Test for ArgumentExceptions where they should be 
	thrown
	* Int32Test.cs: Enable tests for custom format strings.  We do have
	implementation for them now.

2002-09-29  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* DecimalTest.cs: Change from Assert() with == to AssertEquals(). This
	gets the tests to pass on linux, but they shouldn't need that.  Now
	to find out why.  This seems deep...

2002-09-19  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ArrayTest.cs: Report errors with CopyTo().

2002-09-19  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ArrayTest.cs: Can check for exception throw now on CopyTo(). Re-
	enable test.

2002-09-13  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* EnumTest.cs: Add an extreme value test for format.

2002-09-11  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* DoubleTest.cs: Add test for bad format string passed to ToString().

	delegate firing.

2002-09-08  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* DateTimeTest.cs: Disable test bug file it in bugzilla.

2002-09-04  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* EnumTest.cs: 
	  - Added additional "x" formatter test case to test most recent Enum.cs patch
		- Code cleanup so that all TestFormat test cases would be executed
		- Change exception types in TestFormat_Args so that it passes on .NET.
		  (Some ArgumentNullExceptions should be been ArgumentExceptions.)

2002/08/09  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* DecimalTest.cs: Add try-catch block to find which one is throwing
	the Overflow.  Also started making each Assert using a unique message
	to differentiate those as well.

	* MulticastDelegate.cs: Disable tests checking the order that delegates
	are executed.  There's a bugzilla entry for this already because we do
	it in reverse order. See:
	http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=28306

2002/08/02  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ConvertTest.cs (TestGetTypeCode): Find out which test is failing on
	linux.

2002-08-02  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* BufferTest.cs (TestBlockCopy): BlockCopy uses the number of bytes,
	so hard-code some of that info into the test since sizeof() is a very
	unsafe thing to do.

2002-07-31  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* BufferTest.cs: Fixed noisy compiler warnings about unused vars.

2002-07-22  Cesar Octavio Lopez Nataren  <cesar@ciencias.unam.mx>

	implementation.

2002-07-17  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* ConvertTest.cs: Commented out line 456 which contains a non-printable
	character which mcs does not like.  See also bug #27655.

	* DecimalTest.cs, DecimanTest2.cs: Removed the `using S = System'.

2002-07-11  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ArrayTest.cs: Disable a test for now.  Bugzilla'd this one.
	* ConvertTest.cs: Make message unique for this mistaken duplicate.

2002-07-04  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* DateTimeTest.cs: Made tests pass on ms.net.  Well, they pass in
	timezone JST.  Need to test in others.  Maybe I'll fly over to GMT
	and see how they work.  Supposed to be eaiser there.

2002-07-04  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ConvertTest.cs: Make the test generate the overflow exceptions on
	mono on Linux.
	* DecimalTest2.cs: Report exception thrown during subtraction.

	* DoubleTest.cs: Fix some Assert/AssertEquals usage.

2002-07-03  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

2002/06/14  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* Int64Test.cs: Make currency symbol test more culturally sensitive.

2002-06-14  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* DateTimeTest.cs: Make some of the tests a bit more timezone neutral.

2002-06-12   Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ConvertTest.cs: Punt bug in DateTime.Parse() over to that test.
	* DateTimeTest.cs: Add test for date format of yyyy-mm-dd which mono
	doesn't handle automagically like ms.net does.  This smells like a 
	LAMESPEC, however.

2002/06/12  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* RandomTest.cs: Exercise Next(min,max) a little more, especially
	boundary conditions.

2002-06-11  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* UInt64Test.cs: Fix currency symbol/culture issues

2002/06/11  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* DateTimeTest.cs: Remove RunTest override and put culture manipulation
	in SetUp and TearDown like the other tests.
	* TimeZoneTest.cs: Same.

2002-06-11  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* Int64Test.cs: Set the culture to en-US for testing.
	* MathTest.cs: mono is more precise in Log2, so change test to compare
	values within a slightly larger margin of error.

2002/06/10  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* DecimalTest.cs: More culture indepenence. Fixes the problems we were
	having with tests failing against MS.NET.
	* Int64Test.cs: Same plus some formatting fixes.
	* RandomTest.cs: Split Assert into two to figure out which one part is
	failing.

2002-06-09  Lawrence Pit  <loz@cable.a2000.nl>

	* DateTimeTest.cs: Making tests culture independent

2002-06-07  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* DecimalTest.cs: Catch unexpected exception and report it.

2002/06/04  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ByteTest.cs: Fix currency constant that we use for the expected
	value.  Try to be more culture-diverse.

2002/06/03  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* DecimalTest.cs: Fix some errors that were showing up when run against
	ms.net.

2002-06-02  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ConvertTest.cs: Use en-US culture since that's all we support in our
	corlib right now. Change constants accordingly.  Also added a bunch of
	try-catch blocks to show which Assert is failing.

2002-06-02  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* ConvertTest.cs (TestToDecimal): Fixed typo in case #H11.

	* AllTests.cs: Include BugTest.cs in the suite.

2002-05-29  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* DecimalTest.cs: Use AssertEquals to get nice error report, and mark
	each one with a unique message string so we know which one failed.

2002-05-29  Lawrence Pit  <loz@cable.a2000.nl>

	* DateTimeTest.cs: Added tests M01 to M03 to TestParseExact, 
	passing typeof this class as arg in property Suite.

2002-05-22  Lawrence Pit  <loz@cable.a2000.nl>

	* ConsoleTest.cs: Added test writing null.

	* MathTest.cs:
		(TestPow): Add try-catch to determine where we are throwing.
		(TestLog): Re-enable failing test
		(TestLog2): same although this test still fails on mono. Not
		sure what the proper value	to use here. It works on MS.NET

2002-05-21  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* MathTest.cs: Better reporting of failures
	* Int64Test.cs: Add try-catch to determine where we are throwing.

2002-05-07  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ExceptionTest.cs: New File. Provided by Linus Upson.

2002-05-05  Lawrence Pit  <loz@cable.a2000.nl>

	* StringTest.cs: Added test for replace function

2002-04-30  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* UInt32Test.cs: More verbose on unexepected exception to eliminate
	compiler warning.

2002-04-28  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* StringTest.cs: Mark Assert() messages with unique identifiers.
	* DecimalTest2.cs: Write out more info in the Report method.  Need this
	to determine why op_Subtraction() is failing in the next line.
	* MathTest.cs:
	* DoubleTest.cs:
	* UInt32Test.cs: Add try-catch blocks to find out where the test is
	failing.

2002-04-28  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ArrayTest.cs (TestIList_IndexOf): Display exception details if we get
	an unexpected one.

2002/04/24  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* IntegerFormatterTest.cs: Remove Console.WriteLines and use 
	AssertEquals() instead.

2002-04-22  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* StringTest.cs: Add unique markers to Assert messages.

2002-04-09  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ArrayTest.cs: Remove BinarySearch test on unsorted arrays. The
	behavior is undefined if the array isn't sorted.

2002/04/09  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* DecimalTest.cs: Use AssertEquals() for better diagnostic message.

2002-04-09  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ByteTest.cs: Use AssertEquals() for better diagnostic message.

2002-04-08  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* EnumTest.cs: Add a few tests for differently underlying types and
	the [Flags] attribute to test ToString().

2002-04-08  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* EnumTest.cs: Add test for ToString for the case where the enum
	has [Flags] on it, and a mask value is used.

2002-04-04  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* EnumTest.cs: Change one Assert() message string so the two are 
	unique. And clean up exception catching logic.

2002/03/28  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* IntegerFormatterTest.cs: Eliminate warnings about unused exception
	variables.

2002-03-28  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* EnumTest.cs(TestFormat): Use Fail() instead of AssertEquals() in
	try-catch blocks. Add test to check if correct exception is being 
	thrown.

2002/03/18  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ByteTest.cs:
	* Int64Test.cs:
	* SByteTest.cs: Do not hard code the "$" as the currency symbol to
	use for Parse tests. This isn not really the fix we need. These
	number formats vary wildly depending on the culture the system
	runs with.  We need a much better strategy here for testing this.
	* Int32Test.cs: Use #if NOTYET-#endif to disable a test.  This removes
	an annoying compile warning.

2002-03-18  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* DoubleTest.cs:
	* EnumTest.cs: Add unique identifier to Assert()'s. Needed to find
	which one was faling on Linux.

2002-03-12  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ArrayTest.cs: Add tests for IList methods and for enumerator on
	an array with non-zero lower bounds.

2002-03-09  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ArrayTest.cs: Enable the enumerator test and include test for
	Multi-dimensional array enumerator.  Also include test for
	mutation _not_ invalidating the enumerator.

2002-03-09  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* Int16Test.cs, Int32Tests.cs, UInt16Tests.cs: Use "en-US" culture and
	don't let the user override.

	* Int32Tests.cs: Cleanup. Use unique names in Assert()s, use AssertEquals()
	where appropriate etc.

2002-03-08  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* StringTest.cs: More String.Split tests.

2002-03-07  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* StringTest.cs: Added a few more tests for the bug fixes I just
	committed to String.cs.

2002-03-07  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* ArrayTest.cs: Fixed the FIXME in test #E05.

2002-03-06  Duco Fijma  <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>

	to an empty array.

2002-03-06  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* ArrayTest.cs: Use unique labels for all the tests.
	(TestSetValue4): A big new testcase.

2002-03-06  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* VersionTest.cs: Fix for mscorlib behavior vs. docs. CompareTo(null)
	is legal.
	* UInt16Test.cs:
	* UInt32Test.cs:
	* UInt64Test.cs: Use NumberFormatInfo.InvariantInfo.CurrencySymbol
	where "$" was used. Should help suppress false negatives on systems
	where "$" is not the currency symbol.

2002-03-04  Duco Fijma  <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>
	* VersionTest.cs: created test cases for System.Version

2002-03-03  Duco Fijma  <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>
	* CharEnumeratorTest.cs: completed the test cases

2002-03-03  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* DateTimeTest.cs: make static member non-static -- wouldn't work on 
	Windows if it was static. Doesn't _need_ to be static anyway.

2002-03-01  Duco Fijma  <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>
	* AttributeTest.cs: created, far from complete. 
	* CharEnumeratorTest.cs: created. Contains just the basic case.
	* AllTests.cs: added the two new tests above

2002-03-01  Duco Fijma  <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>
	* BitConverterTest.cs: added one test for bug fix made to BitConverter
	* class.

2002-03-01  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* ArrayTest.cs: Commented out a few bits which are not yet implemented and
	marked them with FIXME's.

	* DecimalTest.cs, DecimalTest2.cs: Added zero-arg constructors.

	* MartinTests.cs: Enabled ArrayTests.cs.

2002-03-01  Duco Fijma <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>

	* BitConverterTest.cs: completed test cases

2002-03-01  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MartinTests.cs: 15 tests currently work on Linux, call them all and
	provide comments for the non-working tests.

2002-02-28  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* MathTest.cs: Committed for Jon Guymon <gnarg@slackworks.com>.

2002-02-28  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* String.cs (TestCompare): Added a few tests.
	(TestFormat): Please don't compare two strings with Assert (... == ...),
	use AssertEquals instead - this gives you a better idea what went wrong
	if the test fails.

2002-02-28  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* BitConverterTest.cs: Test was trying to catch the wrong Exception.
	The MSDN docs clearly say ArgumentOutOfRangeException, but that's
	not what get's thrown.

	* DoubleTest.cs: Get working against mscorlib reference.

2002-02-27  Duco Fijma <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>
	* GuidTest.cs: changed to reflect new meaning of Guid.ToString("")
	and Guid.ToString(null)

2002-02-26  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MartinTests.cs: New file. This contains all the test which already
	work on Linux.

	* String.cs: Added two testcases to TestTrim(), TestTrimStart() and
	TestTrimEnd().

2002-02-26  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* DateTimeTest.cs: Added testcases for the parsers. Use the invariant
	culture to run this test suite.

	* TimeZoneTest.cs: Use the invariant culture to run this test suite.

2002-02-26  Duco Fijma <duco@lorentz.xs4all>
	* TimeSpanTest.cs: added test from TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds

2002-02-26  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* DateTimeTest.cs: New test.

	* TimeZoneTest.cs: New test.

2002-02-25  Duco Fijma <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>
	* GuidTest.cs: all methods of System.Guid are now covered
	* BitConverterTest.cs: created, not yet complete

2002-02-21  Duco Fijma <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>
	* GuidTest.cs: changed according to fix in System.Guid

2002-02-20  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* Int64Test.cs: One array was giving us trouble.  Not sure why, but
	it's related to the number of elements in an Array.  For short Arrays
	the compiler doesn't use the PrivateImplmentationDetails struct,
	but for longer ones it does.  That's when our corlib fails. I paired
	down the array for now.

2002-02-19  Duco Fijma <duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl>
	* GuidTest.cs: added a few cases

2002-02-18  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* GuidTest.cs: Fix compile error.  Needed to cast the null in the call to
	constructor to avoid ambiguity.

2002-02-11  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* Int64Test.cs: Various fixes to make tests work against the ms corlib.
	Currency Symbol tests seem to be system dependant.  Not sure if this
	will work on other systems, so please test it if you can. The most
	disturbing one is negative numbers.  Should they be (n) or -n ?

2002-02-10  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* AllTests.cs: Add Int64Test to the Suite
	* Int64Test.cs: Change static member to instance member. This was
	causing NUnitConsole some grief.  Should be instance member anyway.

2002-02-09  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ByteTest.cs:
	* Int16Test.cs:
	* Int32Test.cs:
	* SByteTest.cs:
	* UInt16Test.cs:
	* UInt32Test.cs:
	* UInt64Test.cs: Fixed tests where a "$" was hard coded.  Change it to
	use NumberFormatInfo.CurrentInfo.CurrencySymbol.  Also used
	NumberFormatInfo.InvariantInfo.CurrencySymbol where appropriate. These
	tests all pass now with mscorlib.

2002-01-06  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ResolveEventArgsTest.cs: New test.
	* AllTests.cs: Added new test to suite.

2001-12-27  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* UInt32Test.cs: Added messages to Asserts()'s to find out which one was faliing.

2001-12-21  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* UInt32Test.cs: Added tests for UInt32.Parse.

	* Int32Test.cs: Added tests for Int32.Parse for various cases.

2001-12-08  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ByteTest.cs: Added messages to Assert()'s to find out which one was failing.

2001-11-28  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* Int16Test.cs Int32Test.cs SByteTest.cs: Surgically removed tests that rely on culture of system.  These need to be crafted a bit differently.

2001-11-27  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* SByteTest.cs: Add messages to Assert()'s so we can tell where the tests fail.

2002-02-21  Bob Doan  <bdoan@sicompos.com>

	* BooleanTest.cs: Added New test suite
	* AllTests.cs: Added new Boolean test to suite.

2002-02-24  Bob Doan  <bdoan@sicompos.com>

	* BooleanTest.cs: Use correct argument order in AssertEquals
	* AllTests.cs: Added new Double test to suite.
	* DoubleTest.cs: Add new test suite

2002-02-24  Bob Doan  <bdoan@sicompos.com>

	* DoubleTest.cs: Added parse tests to Double test suite, removed GetHashCodeTests
