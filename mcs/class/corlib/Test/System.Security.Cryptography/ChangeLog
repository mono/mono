2002-11-20  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* RSAPKCS1SignatureDeformatterTest.cs: Removed patch from Nick - 
	as it doesn't seems to work on my system and the exception behavior 
	isn't logical (only MD5 not SHA1, ...).

2002-11-18  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* RSAPKCS1SignatureDeformatterTest.cs: MS .NET throws an exception when
	verifying a bad signature.  Test for that.

	pre-generated vectors from Mono/Windows (cannot yet compare 
	with CryptoAPI/Windows as OAEP isn't available on my system).

	is compatible with the Deformatter.
	* RSAPKCS1KeyExchangeDeformatterTest.cs: Compare results with

2002-10-05  Andrew Birkett  <andy@nobugs.org>

	five work fine under mono, but fail under MS corlib, so I've 
	commented them out.

	* AllTests.cs: Added RC2Test.

2002-09-23  Andrew Birkett  <andy@nobugs.org>
