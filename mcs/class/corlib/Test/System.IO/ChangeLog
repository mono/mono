2002/05/08  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* FileTest.cs: Use "resources" directory and use OS friendly

	* FileTest.cs: Added to CVS. However, this portion of the code
	can't be tested right now.

2002-01-20 Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* AllTests.cs: removed duplicate MemoryStream test
	* MemoryStreamTest.cs: wrapped try-catch blocks around read/write/seek
	tests. These were throwing exceptions that NUnit wasn't catching.  I 
	don't think it used to behave this way before .NET.1.0.
