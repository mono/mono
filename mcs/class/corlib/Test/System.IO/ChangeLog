	* FileTest.cs: Use "resources" directory and use OS friendly
	directory separator characters.  This makes the tests run correctly
	against MS.NET, but not yet in mono on Linux.

	* StreamWriter.cs: Wrap a try-catch around block of code to find out
	what exception is being thrown when it shouldn't.

2002-05-07  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* FileTest.cs: Added TestOpen() from Mike Gray.
	* AllTests.cs: Added missing FileTest.Suite as pointed out by Mike 
	as well.

	* StreamReaderTest.cs: Change location of sample file. In some places,
	use memory stream instead of file stream to eliminate reliance on file 
	io for now.  That area is still a bit immature. Added a bunch of 
	markers to tell where errors were occuring.

	* resources: New directory to hold files open/read, etc. by unit
	tests.

	* StreamReaderTest.cs:
	* StreamWriterTest.cs: Catch and display exception info where it wasn't
	being caught before.

	* StringReader.cs: Added test for peeking and reading at the end of
	a string.

	* MemoryStreamTest.cs 
	* StreamWriterTest.cs 
	* StringReaderTest.cs: Fix test bugs found by running against mscorlib.
	AssertEquals() requires the expected and atual values to be the same
	type if they are to be considered equal.

	* FileTest.cs: Added to CVS. However, this portion of the code
	can't be tested right now.

2002-01-20 Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* AllTests.cs: removed duplicate MemoryStream test
	* MemoryStreamTest.cs: wrapped try-catch blocks around read/write/seek
	tests. These were throwing exceptions that NUnit wasn't catching.  I 
	don't think it used to behave this way before .NET.1.0.
