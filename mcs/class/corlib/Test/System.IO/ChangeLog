	* FileTest.cs: Added to CVS. However, this portion of the code
	can't be tested right now.

	* AllTests.cs: removed duplicate MemoryStream test
	* MemoryStreamTest.cs: wrapped try-catch blocks around read/write/seek
	tests. These were throwing exceptions that NUnit wasn't catching.  I 
	don't think it used to behave this way before .NET.1.0.
