	* X509CertificateTest.cs: Changed how the dates are compared. This
	should stop the nunit errors in X509Certificate.

	* all: make tests build and run under nunit2

2002-12-15  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	GetExpirationDateString tests. Added a test for ToString(true).

2002-11-03  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* AllTests.cs: New. Include all (1) tests files for X509Certificates.
	* X509CertificateTest.cs: New. Generated tests using some (11 right 
	now) X.509 certificates. There is a bigger version (346 certs today)
	to spot new problems (but once spotted they move into this small file).
	GetEffectiveDateString and GetExpirationDateString tests are commented.
