	*  Hashtable.cs: Fixed bug in Clear(), the Count wasn't zeroed.
           From now, Clear() increases modification count.
           Fixed HCP bug in GetHash(object) - hcp.GetHashCode() was used
           instead of hcp.GetHashCode(key). This was resulted in the
           insanely long lookup times when HashCodeProvider was used to
           construct Hashtable. Added thread-safe wrapper.

	* IDictionary.cs (Collections): IDictionary implements ICollection
	as well.  Thanks Sergey!

	* Stack.cs Removed unnecessary locking from many methods of 
	SyncStack, removed SyncEnumerator because it was unnecessary, 
	added a modCount member to Stack and Stack.Enumerator, to 
	ensure that the Stack has not been modified out form under the 
	Enumerator, and changed the Enumerator to use a reference to the 
	stack rather than copying over the contents array.

        * Added implementation of BitArray.

	* Hashtable.cs: Removed call to d.Count in the Hashtable
	constructor that takes an IDictionary as IDictionary does not
	provide a Count field.
