	* Thread.cs: added missing field used by the runtime and
	a new field to support thread-static data.

2003-04-17  Pedro Martínez Juliá  <yoros@wanadoo.es>

	* Timer.cs: Change the position of two lines because they were
	before the "if" that ensures the integrity. After this, the first of
	that two lines was producing a NullReferenceException.

2003-04-09  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Thread.cs: Make sure a reference to the ThreadStart delegate is
	held.  There's no telling how long it will be before
	Thread.Start() is called, and GC might destroy the delegate.
	Thread() and Start() need to be rewritten so that the runtime
	creates the new thread when Start() is called, which will simplify
	the code a great deal.

2003-03-20  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* Thread.cs (CurrentCuluture): use the invaraint culture instead
	of "" for the current_culture setting.

	* Monitor.cs:
	* Thread.cs:
	* ThreadPool.cs:
	* Timer.cs:
	* WaitHandle.cs: Use TotalMilliseconds to convert a TimeSpan to
	ms, not Milliseconds.

2002-12-07  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* Timer.cs: Make it actually work; now it no longer sets your
	application on fire if you use a zero periode and Timer.Change()
	actually works.

2002-11-11  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

2002-10-25  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* Thread.cs: Implement GetDomain() and GetDomainID().

2002-10-24  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ThreadPool.cs: now the monitor thread is not sleeping and checking if

	there's data in the queue it checks if more worker threads needed and
	then sleeps 0.5s before waiting for queued data again.
