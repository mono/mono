	* Thread.cs: DataSlot uses a single system TLS slot, and a
	hashtable per thread.  Some minor changes to reflect the new
	internal calls using the new IO library, and the newly-supported
	bool returns from internal calls.

	* Monitor.cs: Use bool returns from internal calls now they are
	supported by the runtime.  Coalesce enter with the try_enter
	internal call.
