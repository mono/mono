	  if the thread already has the lock. Added readyWaitingReaders variable to
	  keep track of threads ready to get the reader lock.

2004-04-11  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* LockQueue.cs: Moved lockCount change inside the rwlock lock. Removed

	  is not empty (even if state==0).

2004-04-09  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	  AcquireReaderLock works like a call to AcquireWriterLock.

2004-04-06  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* Monitor.cs: In Wait(), release the synchronization context when 
	  exitContext is true.

2004-04-06  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* LockCookie.cs: Keep in this class the count of reader or writer locks
	  for a thread, not only whether it has locks or not.
	* LockQueue.cs: Added property for checking if a thread is waiting in
	  the queue. Wait now returns a boolean that set to false on timeout 
	  expiration.
	* ReaderWriterLock.cs: Started fixing bugs but I had to rewrite a lot of it.
	  The main change is that now it keeps a reader lock count for each
	  thread. This is needed since methods like ReleaseLock or 
	  UpgradeToWriterLock need to return a per-thread status in LockCookie.
	  Also added support for recursive writer-lock requests.

2004-03-21  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ThreadAbortException.cs: use same HResult as MS.

	* Thread.cs: Implemented CurrentPrincipal.

2004-01-22  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ManualResetEvent.cs: added check for disposed.
	* Thread.cs: no need to init this field.

2003-10-01  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	FreeNamedDataSlot.

Wed Aug 20 12:01:36 CEST 2003 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	more fields needed by the runtime.

2003-08-14  Lluis Sanchez Gual  <lluis@ximian.com>

	API, mark it as 'internal'.

2003-07-01  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Thread.cs: Throw an exception if thread creation failed.
	(Better than just blowing up later.)

2003-06-27  Dietmar Maurer  <dietmar@ximian.com>

	* ThreadPool.cs: use async delegate invoke.

2003-06-25  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* WaitHandle.cs: Default handle value should be InvalidHandle, not
	Zero.

	milliseconds.

	* WaitHandle.cs: fixes for WaitAny/All and TimeSpan.

2003-06-06  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WaitHandle.cs: checks and exceptions.

2003-05-31  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* RegisteredWaitHandle.cs: check that the callback is not null before
	invoking.

	* ThreadPool.cs: fixed timeout -> TimeSpan conversions (closes bug
	#43963). Queue the item before setting the handle. If there's a timeout,
	avoid trying to Dequeue, getting the exception et al, just continue the
	loop.

Mon May 19 09:07:45 CEST 2003 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

2003-04-17  Pedro Martï¿½ez Juliï¿½ <yoros@wanadoo.es>

	before the "if" that ensures the integrity. After this, the first of
	that two lines was producing a NullReferenceException.

2003-04-09  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Thread.cs: Make sure a reference to the ThreadStart delegate is
	held.  There's no telling how long it will be before
	Thread.Start() is called, and GC might destroy the delegate.
	Thread() and Start() need to be rewritten so that the runtime
	creates the new thread when Start() is called, which will simplify
	the code a great deal.

2003-03-20  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* Thread.cs (CurrentCuluture): use the invaraint culture instead
	of "" for the current_culture setting.

                    model more equal to the MS one.

2002-12-10  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Monitor.cs:
	* Thread.cs:
	* ThreadPool.cs:
	* Timer.cs:
	* WaitHandle.cs: Use TotalMilliseconds to convert a TimeSpan to
	ms, not Milliseconds.

2002-12-07  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* Timer.cs: Make it actually work; now it no longer sets your
	application on fire if you use a zero periode and Timer.Change()
	actually works.

2002-11-11  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Timer.cs: implemented more stuff. It works now.

2002-10-25  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* Thread.cs: Implement GetDomain() and GetDomainID().

2002-10-24  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ThreadPool.cs: now the monitor thread is not sleeping and checking if
	more worker threads needed. It waits on _DataInQueue. If (and only if)
	there's data in the queue it checks if more worker threads needed and
	then sleeps 0.5s before waiting for queued data again.

2002-09-28  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	Thread.cs, ThreadAbortException.cs, ThreadPool.cs, Timer.cs, WaitHandler.cs : Ditto.

2001-12-11  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* WaitHandle.cs: Implemented WaitAll(), WaitAny() and WaitOne() as
	internal calls.

2001-11-26  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	hashtable per thread.  Some minor changes to reflect the new
	internal calls using the new IO library, and the newly-supported
	bool returns from internal calls.

	* Monitor.cs: Use bool returns from internal calls now they are
	supported by the runtime.  Coalesce enter with the try_enter
