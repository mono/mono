System.Object:
	Need a mechanism for getting an object underlying type.

System.ValueType:
	Need to lock memory and "scan" the actual contents to compute
	hash code and do comparissions.  Should be simple to do with
	C#, the problem is figuring out the size of the object.

System.String:
	Need to implement the Format() and CompareOrdincal() methods 
	as we all implement all of the methods that take into account 
	CultureInfo.
