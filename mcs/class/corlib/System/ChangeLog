	implemented the stdin stuff

	* Int32.cs: impl. real op_Equal

2001-08-24  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* (common.src): Removed IAsyncResult as it is not on CVS yet.

	* UIntPtr.cs: Removed CLSCompliant attribute before the namespace,
	as it breaks the build.

2001-08-23  Michael Lambert <michaellambert@email.com>

	* IntPtr.cs: Optimized unsafe declaration, implemented GetObjectData, 
	added CLSCompliant attribute

	* IAsyncResult.cs: Added

2001-08-20  Dietmar Maurer  <dietmar@ximian.com>

	* Attribute.cs: uncomment some code to make it compile again

2001-08-16  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* Attribute.cs: implemented all methods except GetHashCode()

	* common.src: added Attribute.cs so it would compile in

2001-08-10  Dietmar Maurer  <dietmar@ximian.com>

	* Object.cs: changed MemberWiseClone to MemberwiseClone, and
	marked it as InternalCall

2001-08-06  Bob Smith  <bob@thestuff.net>

        * Random.cs: Compile fix. Needs more testing.

2001-08-06 Garrett Rooney <rooneg@electricjellyfish.net>

	* Uri.cs: Initial Implementation.  Parsing needs to be fixed to take 
	into account IPv6 addresses, url encoding needs to be implemented, and 
	various minor methods need to be written, but this is a decent start.

2001-08-06  Dietmar Maurer  <dietmar@ximian.com>

	dependend stuff, the Parse and ToString members

2001-08-01  Dietmar Maurer  <dietmar@ximian.com>

	* Type.cs (GetTypeFromHandle): added placeholder 

2001-07-24  Derek Holden  <dholden@draper.com>

	* Boolean.cs: Formatted to code style standard. Added GetTypeCode
	which is really an IConvertible defined method.

	* Byte.cs: Added a missing Parse method. Put in Parse and ToString
	behavior, still need to do the main Parse and ToString.

	* Char.cs: Added a bunch of missing ECMA methods. Commented a
	specification discrepency. Still didn't any unicode stuff, though
	every IsFoo(char c) method has an IsFoo(string, index)
	counterpart, added wrappers for those.
	
	* Convert.cs: Fixed NaN/Inf checking and double/float
	rounding. Added ToType for IConvertible classes

	* Double.cs: Fixed ECMA min and max values. Added IsInfinity /
	IsNaN methods. Changed Inf/NaN internals.

	overloaded ToString and Parse methods.

	overloaded ToString and Parse methods.

	* Attribute.cs: New file.

	* Type.cs: New file.

	* ParamArrayAttribute.cs: New file.

	* RuntimeTypeHandle.cs: New file.

	* MulticastDelegate.cs: Added.

	* DateTime.cs: Added

	* Delegate.cs: Added

2001-07-18  Michael Lambert <michaellambert@email.com>

        * AttributeTargets.cs: Add.

2001-07-19  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* Char.cs: Made ToUpper and ToLower public methods.

	* String.cs: Lots and lots of compile fixes - just need to write
	DateTime.cs and this should build completely now.

2001-07-19  Bob Smith (bob@thestuff.net)

	* Math.cs: Implemented. 

2001-07-19  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* String.cs: Removed tolower and toupper.

	* Char.cs: Moved ToLower and ToUpper from string to here. 

	* Convert.cs ToByte (float value), ToByte (double value) Use IsNan
	instead of comparing the value to Nan.

2001-07-19  Duco Fijma (duco@lorentz.xs4all.nl)

	* TimeSpan.cs: New implementation.

2001-07-18  Scott Sanders <scott@stonecobra.com>

         * UriFormatExcpetion.cs: Add - 85% complete

2001-07-17  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* String.cs (IndexOf): Slight optimization that allows skipping
	over a few chars here and there. This isn't as good as using my
	Boyer-Moore implementation, however, Boyer-Moore is only really
	good for long strings (I plan on making the code decide which
	string search algorithm it should use on-the-fly at some point).
	(LastIndexOf): Fix to work correctly.
	(BoyerMoore): Took out some unneeded code and fixed an edge-case.

2001-07-16  Michael Lambert <michaellambert@email.com>

	* EventArgs.cs: Add.
	
2001-07-16  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* Version.cs: Remove my buggy comment.

2001-07-15  Sean MacIsaac  <macisaac@ximian.com>

	* String.cs: Spelling error of IComparable, object's
	MemberwiseClone cannot be overridden.  Made indexer valid for now,
	but not sure what to do about this in the long run.  Seems to be a
	couple bugs in csc.exe having to do with multiple pointer defs in
	the same statement, and returning subclasses of a class in the
	return type of an interface function implementation.  Also moved
	operators inside of class definition.

2001-07-14  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* String.cs: A tom of compile fixes, although we still don't compile.

	* IConvertible.cs: The To*Int64() methods return *Int64's, not
	*Int32's. Also, it's ToDateTime() not ToDateType().

2001-07-14  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* String.cs: Apparently I needed to at least write stubs for the
	IConvertible interfaces. *sigh*

2001-07-14  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* String.cs: Many logic/other fixes and better usage of the
	features of c#
	(tolower): New convenience method to help condense code.
	(toupper): Another new helper method.
	(Compare): Use the new helper methods.
	(ToLower): use tolower().
	(ToUpper): use toupper().
	(LastIndexOfAny): Implemented.
	(BoyerMoore): New private helper method that implements a modified
	version of the Boyer-Moore search algorithm. Noothing uses it yet
	as I'm not 100% sure it even works properly with unicode strings
	not to mention it uses a huge lookup-table :-)
	(Split): Implemented.

2001-07-13  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* TODO: Added things that need to be finished in System.String

	* String.cs: New source file implementing the System.String class

	error.

2001-07-12  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* Array.cs: Fix backwards parameters to Array.SetValue()
	throughout.
	(BinarySearch): Fix backward logic surrounding whether to call
	value.CompareTo or comparer.Compare.
	(LastIndexOf): Stop being stupid. I am so not used to strongly
	bounded arrays...
	(Sort): Implement a quicksort.

2001-07-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* Array.cs: Change all instances of trying to access an array with
	the index operator to calls to GetValue and SetValue, and add
	InternalGetValue and InternalSetValue which are internal calls
	into the runtime. Ew.

2001-07-10  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* Array.cs: Implemented everything but Sort().

2001-07-09  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* Object.cs (Object::Equals): Object variable name is `o'.

2001-07-06  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* Int16.cs, Int32.cs, Int64.cs, UInt16.cs, UInt32.cs, UInt64.cs:
	Implement the IComparable and IFormattable interfaces. Fix a typo
	(publig -> public)

	* ApplicationException.cs, ArgumentException.cs,
	ArgumentNullException.cs, ArgumentOutOfRangeException.cs,
	ArtithmeticException.cs, ArrayTypeMismatchException.cs,
	DivideByZeroException.cs, DuplicateWaitObjectException.cs,
	ExecutionEngineException.cs, FormatException.cs,
	IndexOutOfRangeException.cs, InvalidCastException.cs,
	InvalidOperationException.cs, InvalidProgramException.cs,
	MulticateNotSupportedException.cs, NotFiniteNumberException.cs,
	NotSupportedException.cs, NullReferenceException.cs,
	OutOfMemoryException.cs, OverflowException.cs, RankException.cs,
	StackOverflowException.cs, SystemException.cs,
	TypeInitializationException.cs: Added all of the exceptions
	specified by the language spec. Mmmm... bloat.

2001-07-06  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* Int64.cs, Int32.cs: Put.  Parsing and ToString missing.  Should
	do a generic routine all of these guys use.

	* Int16.cs: identified missing methods.

	* UInt16.cs, UInt32.cs, UInt64.cs: Add.

2001-06-26  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>
