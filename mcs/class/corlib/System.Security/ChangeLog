2005-05-09  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SecurityContext.cs: Capture the CompressedStack when the current 
	context one is empty.
	* SecurityManager.cs: Class is now static (2.0).
	* SecurityTreatAsSafeAttribute.cs: Fixed AttributeTargets.

2005-05-06  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CodeAccessPermission.cs: Reworked frames check to check only for
	the stack modifiers. Throwing a SecurityException now calls Assembly.
	UnprotectedGetName () to avoid throwing (recursively) other 
	SecurityExceptions.
	* PermissionSet.cs: Reworked frames check to include Assembly (moved) 
	and AppDomain (new) transitions.
	* SecurityFrame.cs: Added Domain member to match the runtime structure
	definition. Removed debugging code (will be moved into the runtime 
	later) as it can cause SecurityException is some cases.
	* SecurityManager.cs: Added a method to check if a PermissionSet is
	granted by an AppDomain.

2005-04-28  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* PermissionSetCollection.cs: Updated wrt beta2. Seems this will be
	removed before 2.0 final.
	* HostProtectionException.cs: Updated wrt beta2. Added TODO as it 
	isn't support by the runtime.
	* SecurityContext.cs: Updated wrt beta2. Class is now internal in 
	NET_1_1 to allow the compressed stack propagation to other threads.
	* SecurityCriticalAttribute.cs: Added support for property Scope.
	* SecurityException.cs: Removed PermitOnlySetInstance property to 
	match beta2.
	* SecurityTransparentAttribute.cs: Fixed AttributeUsage. Added TODO
	as it isn't support by the runtime.
	* SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurityAttribute.cs: Added delegates to usage
	in NET_2_0.

2005-04-27  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SecurityCriticalScope.cs: New. Enum introduced in 2.0 beta2.
	* SecurityTreatAsSafeAttribute.cs: New. Attribute introducted in 2.0
	beta2.

2005-04-25  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* HostSecurityManager.cs: Now refers to HostSecurityManagerOptions.
	* HostSecurityManagerFlags.cs: Renamed enum to 
	HostSecurityManagerOptions.

2005-03-31  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SecurityException.cs: Added try/catch in GetObjectData because the
	PermissionState property is serialized only if both ControlEvidence 
	and ControlPolicy are granted.

2005-03-24  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CodeAccessPermission.cs: Fixed PermitOnly when used in a set. Added
	an InheritanceDemand for ControlEvidence and ControlPolicy on the 
	class.
	* PermissionSet.cs: Added an InheritanceDemand for MS public key on 
	class.
	* SecurityException.cs: Moved PermissionType up in ToString as this
	property isn't restricted (i.e. will be part of the output even if
	the other properties can't make it).

2005-03-15  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CodeAccessPermission.cs: Fixed depth for starting the stack walk
	(imperative) and fixed assert condition.
	* PermissionSet.cs: Fixed depth for starting the stack walk.
	* SecurityFrame.cs: Reversed stack. Added optional debugging code.

2005-03-14  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SecurityManager.cs: Fix CodeAccessPermissionTest.CustomCAS unit test
	when --security is enabled (code was over-optimized ;-).

2005-03-11  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SecurityManager.cs: Added methods to support reflection query and 
	invoke for LinkDemand and InheritanceDemand. Added method to do a
	stack walk (demand) when a p/invoking (called by JIT generated code).

2005-03-02  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CodeAccessPermission.cs,
	* PermissionSet.cs: Don't throw NotSupportedException if the security 
	manager (SecurityManager.SecurityEnabled) is off.

2005-02-25  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* CodeAccessPermission.cs: Implement Equals for NET_2_0 profile.
	* PermissionSet.cs: Added code to decode the metadata format used for
	declarative security in 2.0 (except enums and arrays now).
	* PermissionSetCollection.cs: Added code to decode from the new metadata
	format used for declarative security in 2.0.
	* SecurityManager.cs: Added support for LinkDemandChoice, Inheritance
	DemandChoice and DemandChoice (2.0). Added support for reflected 
	LinkDemand (promotes the demand to a full Demand).

2005-02-15  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* SecurityException.cs: Show the method informations when displaying a
	SecurityException.
	* SecurityManager.cs: Reworked InheritanceDemand implementation. Added
	a new method to throw a SecurityException for an InheritanceDemand.

2005-02-10  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 
 
	* SecurityManager.cs: Reduced the number of parameters for LinkDemand.
	Removed a (forgotten) debugging message.

2005-02-10  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SecurityException.cs: Show more information when a SecurityException
	occurs to help debugging.
	* SecurityManager.cs: Reworked LinkDemand implementation. Supply more
	informations when throwing a SecurityException for LinkDemand.
	* PermissionSet.cs: Remove (now) unused code for LinkDemand.

2005-02-08  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SecurityManager.cs: Updated code for LinkDemand (and it's special
	cases).

2005-01-27  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CodeAccessPermission.cs: Process Deny for empty PermissionSet (e.g.
	an unrestricted permission set must deny all permissions).
	* SecurityException.cs: Added missing HResult to NET_2_0 constructors.
	Added securiy permissions for GrantedSet, RefusedSet and 
	PermissionState properties (to avoid leaking policy informations). 
	Make sure that ToString() always works.
	* SecurityManager.cs: Remove outdated comments (now that the 
	declarative attributes are in place).

2005-01-25  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SecurityManager.cs: Now use Environment.InternalGetFolderPath to
	avoid recursion when initializing security policies.

2005-01-24  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CodeAccessPermission.cs: Made ThrowSecurityException static so it 
	can be reused from PermissionSet.
	* SecurityManager.cs: Use the new icalls for SecurityEnabled and
	CheckExecutionRights properties. Fix IsGranted for unrestricted 
	permissions. Set type correctly when loading policy files.
	* PermissionSet.cs: Now supports unrestricted permission set when
	evaluating demands.

2005-01-22  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SecurityFrame.cs: Keep RuntimeDeclSecurityEntry enum in sync with
	runtime (added index to allow AOT to work with declarative security).

2005-01-19  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SecurityManager.cs: Fix the regressions on NET_1_1 introduced by my
	refactoring 10 days ago.

2005-01-11  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* PermissionSet.cs: Simplified GetHashCode as two exact copies may 
	have different hash codes (documented as such). This fix some unit
	tests for 2.0.

2005-01-10  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* HostSecurityManager.cs: Fix signature as DetermineApplicationTrust
	doesn't return a boolean anymore.
	* SecurityElement.cs: The attributes and children elements are not
	indented in 2.0. This fix many unit tests that do string compares.
	* PermissionSetCollection.cs: We can't trust all IList implementations
	to throw the ArgumentOutOfRangeException - so we better do it here.

2005-01-09  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CodeAccessPermission.cs: CheckAssert, CheckDemand, CheckDeny and
	CheckPermitOnly are no more publicly avaiable in Fx 2.0 and have been
	changed to internal for all profiles. Updated comments to reflect the
	(better) documentation available with 2.0.
	* HostSecurityManager.cs: Updated to Dec CTP specs. There is missing
	documentation (and/or classes) to implement completly the 
	DetermineApplicationTrust method at this point.
	* PermissionSetCollection.cs: Completed implementation.
	* PermissionSet.cs: Fix the case where Assert, Deny and PermitOnly 
	must be ignored for non-CAS permissions.
	* SecurityManager.cs: Refactored resolve methods to implements 
	ResolveSystemPolicy (a resolve without the AppDomain policy level).
	Added a default implementation for GetZoneAndOrigin (empty ArrayList) 
	which seems to be right (at least) for FullTrust. 

2005-01-08  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* AllowPartiallyTrustedCallersAttribute.cs: Cleanup;
	* HostSecurityManagerFlags.cs: Updated flags for 2.0 Dec CTP.
	* SecurityCriticalAttribute.cs: New. New 2.0 attribute.
	* SecurityTransparentAttribute.cs: New. New 2.0 attribute.
	* SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurityAttribute.cs: Cleanup;

2004-12-20  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CodeAccessPermission.cs: Refactored to play more nicely with 
	PermissionSet and the new functionalities in the runtime.
	* PermissionSet.cs: Modified to use the new functionalities in the
	runtime. This allows the declarative stack modifiers to work in a 
	stack walk.
	* SecurityFrame.cs: New. This is the managed representation of the
	security informations associated with a stack frame. This current
	version only support declarative stack modifiers.
	* SecurityManager.cs: Modified to use the new functionalities in the
	runtime.

2004-11-30  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CodeAccessPermission.cs:
	* NamedPermissionSet.cs:
	* PermissionSet.cs:
	* SecurityElement.cs:
	* SecurityException.cs:
		Added ComVisible attributes to match 2.0 October Preview.
	* SecureString.cs: Added an internal method to get the unencrypted 
	string (required to use the string inside mscorlib).

2004-10-19  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SecurityManager.cs: Changed private static methods to use a single
	parameter (as method permissions overrides class permissions for
	demand, assert, deny and permitonly).

2004-10-15  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CodeAccessPermission.cs: Implemented stubs (soon to be icalls) to
	get/set/clear the current security frame on the stack. Implemented
	Assert, Deny and PermitOnly with the new methods. Changed Demand to
	use the CheckAssert, CheckDeny, CheckPermitOnly and CheckDemand 
	introduced in 2.0.
	* PermissionSet.cs: Fixed IsEmpty using documentation from 2.0 beta 1.
	Implemented immediate (i.e. no stack walk) caller demand (CAS and 
	non-CAS) required for LinkDemand and InheritanceDemand. Implemented
	Assert, Deny and PermitOnly using CodeAccessPermission new methods.
	Re-implement Demand to separate CAS and non-CAS permissions.
	* SecurityManager.cs: Added new private static methods that will 
	either be called by the JIT (linkdemand), runtime (inheritancedemand)
	or by code emitted by the JIT (demand, assert, deny and permitonly).

2004-10-15  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SecurityException.cs: Provide more details when a security exception
	is raised (to help debugging).

2004-09-02  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* PermissionSet.cs: Updated to match latest unit tests, i.e. match
	Fx 1.1 on NET_1_1 and Fx 2.0 (beta 1) in NET_2_0.
	* SecurityElement.cs: FromString is now internal before NET_2_0.

2004-09-01  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* NamedPermissionSet.cs: FromXml now calls base class instead of an
	internal method of PermissionSet. This should allow class to inherit
	from NamedPermissionSet properly.
	* PermissionSet.cs: Added an internal PolicyLevel property to allow
	policy file class name resolution. Fixed IsEmpty to return true if
	the list contains "empty" permissions. Fixed Copy to copy permissions
	even for unrestricted sets (again because of IUnrestrictedPermission).
	* SecurityManager.cs: Fixed Resolve(Evidence) because permission 
	classes	Intersect methods can either return null or an empty 
	PermissionSet.  Fixed ResolvePolicy(Evidence[]) for null (NET_2_0).

2004-08-31  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* PermissionSet.cs: Fixed RemovePermission and Intersect (due to typos
	in unit tests). Fixed SetPermission (null).

2004-08-30  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* NamedPermissionSet.cs: Fixed Description in copies, GetHashCode and
	Equals (for NET_2_0). Fixed handling of null Name when deserialized 
	from XML.
	* PermissionSet.cs: AddPermission now unions permissions of the same
	type. CopyTo throw (most) exceptions only if there are items in the
	set. Implemented Demand (but without support for Assert, Deny and 
	PermitOnly). Fixed deserialized from XML when no class is specified.
	Started implementation of ConvertPermissionSet (error cases). Fixed
	Intersect to be compatible (including bugs like FDBK14612) with MS.
	RemovePermission now compatible with MS (bug? FDBK14622). Fixed Union
	to work with permissions that do not implement IUnrestrictedPermission.

2004-08-26  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SecurityElement.cs: Fixed the new Copy() in Fx 2.0 as it isn't a 
	deep copy. Throw proper exceptions in FromString (Fx 2.0).
	* SecurityManager.cs: Throw a NullReference exception in 
	SavePolicyLevel as MS won't fix it (FDBK13121).

2004-08-19  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* CodeAccessPermission.cs : csc build fix. Currently mcs has bugs on
	  CS0136 error detection (variable identifiers in switch cases share
	  the scope).

2004-08-17  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CodeAccessPermission.cs: Added common methods to help building all
	Permissions classes in corlib. Most are declared static as they can 
	also help non CodeAccessPermission-derived permissions.

2004-08-12  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SecurityManager.cs: Change ResolvePolicy to only care about host
	provided evidence to create identity permissions.
	* SecurityContextSwitcher.cs: Added missing [ReliabilityContract] to 
	Undo method.

2004-08-11  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CodeAccessPermission.cs: Basic implementation for Demand (without
	full stack trace, i.e. Assert, Deny and PermitOnly aren't considered).
	Added TODO to unimplemented NET_2_0 methods.
	* HostSecurityManager.cs: Added comments (as it looked not implemented
	even to myself).
	* PermissionSet.cs: Fixed Unrestricted when copied. Changed exception
	ordering in Copy (ArgumentNullException couldn't work). Made IsEmpty
	more robust.
	* SecurityManager.cs: Implemented IsGranted using Assembly.Demand. 
	Basic implementation for policy resolution.

2004-08-03  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* PermissionSetCollection.cs: New class in Fx 2.0.
	* SecureString.cs: New class in Fx 2.0. Not yet encrypted.

2004-08-02  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* PolicyTypeLevel.cs: Removed duplicate license.
	* SecurityManager.cs: Moved secuirty demands as attributes (but mcs 
	doesn't seem to encode them properly as they show up in corcompare).
	Implemented IsGranted, ResolvePolicy (but some code is still missing
	in related classes) and SavePolicy/SavePolicyLevel.

2004-07-14  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CodeAccessPermission.cs: Added CheckAssert, CheckDemand, CheckDeny,
	CheckPermitOnly, Equals and GetHashCode to NET_2_0 profile. Actualized

	NET_2_0 profile. Removed duplicate license.
	* SecurityManager.cs: Added GetZoneAndOrigin and ResolvePolicy to 
	NET_2_0 profile. Removed duplicate license.
	* VerificationException.cs: Implements _Exception for NET_2_0 profile.
	Removed duplicate license.
	* XmlSyntaxException.cs: Implements _Exception for NET_2_0 profile. 
	Removed duplicate license.

2004-07-14  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	  to allow namespaced elements.

2004-01-27  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* SecurityElement.cs: Attributes are now kept in an ArrayList (but
	still returned in an Hashtable) so the attributes order can be
	kept like MS implementation (but Hashtable cannot guarantee this).

2004-01-26  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* NamedPermissionSet.cs: Changed internal constructor 
	NamedPermissionSet (SecurityElement e) to NamedPermissionSet ().

	PermissionSet (SecurityElement e) to PermissionSet ().

2004-01-24  David Sheldon <dave-mono@earth.li>

       * SecurityElement.cs: Changed indentation in ToString, it seems
        MS indent by 3 spaces, not 4. Also added NewLine to childless 
	elements.

2004-01-24  David Sheldon <dave-mono@earth.li>

       * SecurityElement.cs: Changed newline distribution in ToString.
         Matches MS better.

2004-01-06  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	(permissions that do not implement, the internal, IBuiltInPermission).
	Ref. http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52626
	* SecurityException.cs: Fixed ToString() which could, when no 
	PermissionType where specified, throws a NullReferenceException.
	Ref. http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52626

2004-01-05  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* CodeAccessPermission.cs: Fixed Union to match 1.1/1.2 documentation.
