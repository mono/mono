	* FileStream.cs: when running on Windows and a path with Unix
	directory separator chars is passed (including an UNC share), get
	the canonical form of the path before attempting to retrieve its
	directory name. Fixes bug #607502

	* Path.cs: typo fix

2010-05-08  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* Path.cs: vararg overload of Combine now correctly concatenates
	segments.
	The 3 and 4 argument overloads of Combine check whether the passed
	segments are null or not.

2010-05-05 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* Path.cs: prevent infinite loop when TMPDIR (or equivalent)
	points to a non-existent directory.

	Moonlight. Name property returns "[Unknown]" unless a Moonlight
	application is executed with elevated trust.
	* Path.cs: Ensure elevated trust when calling a GetTempPath,
	GetTempFileName or GetFullPath on Moonlight. Add a shared 
	internal method to validate paths to reduce code duplication.

2010-04-15  Jb Evain  <jbevain@novell.com>

	* Directory.cs: don't fully qualify name when not it's necessary.

2010-03-29  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* DirectoryInfo.cs, FileInfo.cs: Moonlight needs the default ctor
	to decorate them with [SecuritySafeCritical] for corclr 
	inheritance rules

2010-03-25 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* Directory.cs: a directory named ":" is legal in unix.
	This gets rid of the annoying ":" folder when running
	corlib tests.

2010-03-22  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Directory.cs, DirectoryInfo.cs: Disble new NET_4_0 API used in
	SL4 until we have elevated trust working correctly (since they 
	are *not* decorated as [SecurityCritical])

2010-03-17 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* StreamReader.cs: if the detected encoding is different from the
	provided to the constructor, adjust the decoded buffer size if
	needed. Fixes bug #589236.

2010-03-17  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Stream.cs: CopyTo methods are part of SL4 too

	part of SL4. Throw a SecurityException in Moonlight in non-debug
	builds until we're ready for elevated trust.

2010-03-11  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@gmail.com>

	* Path.cs (GetTempFileName): Fix infinite loop if the process doesn't have
	write access to /tmp. Fixes #585017.

2010-02-22  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MemoryStream.cs: When setting Capacity, don't create a new buffer if
	the new expected value is the same as the current one.

2010-02-15 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* StreamWriter.cs:
	* FileStream.cs: if flushing fails when disposing the stream, make
	sure it is closed before throwing the exception. Fixes bug #579146.

2010-01-31  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@gmail.com>

	* UnmanagedMemoryStream.cs: add the SafeBuffer overloads.

2010-01-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* StreamReader.cs: When detecting the encoding we usually check the
	four first bytes looking for either UTF32 or UTF8 BOM, since they share
	the first two bytes, but if we happen to have less than 4 bytes at
	detection time, just check for Unicode and use it as the current
	encoding - this is exactly what .Net does, and it is specially visible
	with NetworkStream.
	Fixes #534137.

2010-01-19  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>
	* BufferedStream.cs: Patch by Tom Philpot to optimise ReadByte and

	directly reading from the buffer.

2010-01-14  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* UnmanagedMemoryStream.cs: Read: don't read bytes one-by-one, read all
	at once.

2010-01-03  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MemoryStream.cs: Don't clear the bytes beyond Length when shrinking
	it. Instead just save the related information for it and do it when
	Length grows and touchs that dirty region. Refactor the code where
	needed to avoid duplication as well.
	Fixes #327053.

2009-12-21  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* File.cs (ReadAllBytes): We cannot assume that a single call to
	Read will return all the data we require.

2009-11-24  Marek Safar <marek.safar@gmail.com>

	* StreamReader.cs, FileStream.cs: Use recycle buffer to avoid
	repeated underlying buffer initialization (saves hefty 10MB
	during corlib compilation).

	short-writes as those can happen when a FileStream is used on top
	of a pipe on Unix.

	probing if there was data on a stream before to avoid blocking. o

2009-04-24 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* StreamReader.cs: if Peek() needs to block, do it.

	throw IsolatedStorageException instead of FileNotFoundException and
	DirectoryNotFoundException.

2008-08-21  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* FileStream.cs: Adjust exception being thrown for Silverlight 2.0.
	* FileSystemInfo.cs: In Silverlight 2 this type does not inherit from 
	MarshalByRefObject nor does it implement ISerializable.

	it's needed for IsolatedStorage.

2008-04-17  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* DirectoryInfo.cs: Added new internal ctor, which takes a bool that
	indicates whether the original path should only container the last
	part of the directory. Moved logic for determining the Name and
	Parent to Initialize method, to allow it to be re-used on
	deserialization. Renamed argument names to fix corcompare issues.
	Added missing argument checks.
	* Directory.cs (CreateDirectoriesInternal): Use internal ctor for

2007-11-21  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* FileStream.cs : Close() does not exist in 2.0 (Stream does).
	  Move GC.SuppressFinalize() to Dispose(true).

2007-11-12  Juraj Skripsky  <js@hotfeet.ch>

	* Path.cs (GetRandomFileName): Return filenames containing only
	characters from the range [a..z0..9] as MS.NET does. 

2007-11-02  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* StreamReader.cs : Encoding.GetMaxCharCount() does not always return
	  the maximum max char count for Decoder.GetChars() since it might
	  contain pending buffer by flush. Fixed bug #338370.

2007-11-01  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Path.cs (GetDirectoryName): The paths returned from this routine
	should be canonical, not just a substring.   In addition to fixing
	this, it also fixes #324742.

2007-10-26  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* BinaryReader.cs, BinaryWriter.cs : use unsafe encoding that has ""
	  for replacement fallback. Binary serialization regression is fixed.

2007-09-06  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Stream.cs, BufferedStream.cs, MemoryStream.cs: in 2.0 override
	  Dispose(bool) rather than Close().

	* IntPtrStream.cs : added internal get_BaseAddress(), for the same.

2007-05-25  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* UnmanagedMemoryStream.cs: In Read and ReadByte, use Marshal.ReadByte
	to read bytes as this allows us to start reading from the current
	position. In Read, return 0 when reading beyond the end of the stream
	and only read bytes until the end of the stream (not capacity).
	In ReadByte, return -1 when reading beyond the end of the stream.
	In SetLength: changed argument validation (and reported exceptions) to
	match MS, removed duplicate access check and changed the current
	position if length is less than position. In Write: throw
	NotSupportedException when attempting to write beyond capacity, use
	Marshal.WriteByte since that allows us to start writing from the
	current position. Adjust length when position moves beyond length
	in both Write and WriteByte. Allow position to be moved beyond
	capacity of stream. Fixed position using Seek (=+ typo). Changed
	CanRead to ignore current position. Allow Position to be used to move
	beyond capacity of stream.

2007-05-24  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* UnmanagedMemoryStream.cs: Changed argument names and exceptions 
	(msg, params) to match MS. Verify access argument in ctor. 

2007-05-23  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* UnmanagedMemoryStream.cs : couple of bugfixes. in Read(), don't
	  return buffer beyond the requested length. Fixed .ctor() for wrong
	  capacity initialization.

	* FileStream.cs: Respect request for buffering in all cases.

	Gonzalo added code in r42667 that disables buffering even when it is
	requested, in the case that ftype != MonoFileType.Disk. This was
	killing performance for users who do Console.OpenStandardOutput(1024)
	but were ending up with a non-buffered FileStream.

	The new behaviour appears correct but we should watch for any
	regressions.

2007-04-05  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	docs, UnauthorizedAccessException is thrown if the underlying
	platform does not support it and *also* if there are no
	permissions to access it, which is more convenient than the
	PlatformNotSupportedException that only states that it needs Win2k
	or newer).

2006-12-23  Alp Toker  <alp@atoker.com>

	* Directory.cs: "platfor" typofix

2006-12-22  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	always use file/assembly load failure message when no message is set
	(regardless of whether a filename was specified or not). Made some

	because we need to implement the method on Windows.
	* Path.cs 
	(CanonicalizePath) Added new function to get
	rid of . and .. in path names. Need to figure out what
	other functions should call this.

2003-04-20  Igor Nosyryev <nosyryev@attbi.com>

	* StringReader.cs (Read): Increment nextChar by charsToRead
	instead of count, that will guarantee that the next time the
	method is called, it will return 0 on an empty string rather than
	throwing an exception

2003-04-19  Ville Palo <vi64pa@kolumbus.fi>

	* BufferedStream.cs: Some fixes, mostly throwing exceptions.

	ObjectDisposedException if the handle has been released.
	
	(Read): Throw exceptions specified in the spec.

	(Read, Write, ReadSegment, WriteSegment): There is no requirement for any

	the new MemoryStreamTest.

2003-03-05  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	SetCreationTime, SetLastAccessTime and SetLastWriteTime.

2003-02-26  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* MemoryStream.cs:
	(ToArray): return only the portion of the buffer that contains
	data, not the whole buffer. (note: this makes XmlDocument.Load work
	again with documents that have a <?xml without the 'encoding'
	attribute, which makes gtk-sharp generator work again).

2003-02-25  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* MemoryStream.cs: create the buffer of the specified capacity.

2003-01-31  Patrik Torstensson

	* MemoryStream.cs: use BlockCopyInternal instead of Array.Copy, this is
	the same way as MS does it (performance improvement)

	too, not only with relative ones.

2002-12-07  Peter Williams  <peterw@ximian.com>

	* StreamWriter.cs: Changed all Encoding.UTF8 to Encoding.UTF8Unmarked.

2002-10-31  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* FileStream.cs: Fix buffering properly this time.  Also kludge
	around broken pipe errors, treating them as EOF instead of
	throwing an IO exception.

	GetLastError() value has long since been blown away if we try and
	look it up in a subsequent internal call invocation.

	* FileSystemInfo.cs:

	* File.cs:

	calls to MonoIO.Seek.  Fixed buffering in Read() so that it
	doesn't block forever on short reads.

	* MonoIO.cs: Added GetFileType

2002-10-21  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	\n (this is what MS does).

2002-10-18  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* TextWriter.cs (Null): The Null field should be an instance of a
	TextWriter class that does nothing, so it is an instance of the
	NullTextWriter class.

2002-09-16  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* MemoryStream.cs (Close): Don't throw an exception if the stream
	is already closed.

2002-09-15  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* FileStream.cs (Dispose): Call FlushBuffer(), and not Flush, as
	Flush calls fsync().  

	The API docs show no explicit mention that Flush() should even do
	an fsync, I am thinking that we should drop that from the
	runtime. 

2002-09-09  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* StreamWriter.cs: When no encoding is provided, create an
	encoding without markers, this is what MS does.

	that there is no directory information about the path.

2002-08-20  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* FileNotFoundException.cs: use Message and InnerException from base
	class. Changed Message and ToString ().

	chars

2002-05-17  Dan Lewis  <dihlewis@yahoo.co.uk>

	* FileStream.cs: Enforce lower bound on buffer size.

2002-05-16  Piers Haken <piersh@friskit.com>

	* Stream.cs: Implement synchronous {Begin|End}{Read|Write}() methods.

2002-05-17  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

2002-05-07  Mike Gray     <mikeg_us@hotmail.com>

	use new internal class since null cannot be passed to constructor 
	anymore. Also, fix a coule of small bugs.

2002-05-03  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* MemoryStream.cs: Refrain from allocating array until the space is
	really needed. This fixes a bug in the Length property when the
	constructor without the byte array is used.

2002-05-01  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* DirectoryNotFoundException.cs (constructor): Added missing
	serialization constructor.

2002-04-30  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* FileLoadException.cs (constructors): Added missing (string,
	string) ctor, as well as (string, string, Exception) ctor.

	(Message): Added more info to the error message

	(ToString): Added. We'll need to add the StackTrace stuff when
	that works.

	* FileShare.cs: Add a missing field, Inheritable.
	
	* TextReader.cs: Renamed Synchronised method to Synchronized.

	* TextWriter.cs: Renamed Synchronised method to Synchronized.
	Renamed protected member coreNewLine to CoreNewLine.

2002-04-30  Sergey Chaban  <serge@wildwestsoftware.com>

	* BinaryReader.cs: Allocate buffer before its first use.
	Handle end of stream properly. Methods to read native types
	(ReadInt* etc.) are little-endian (see Compact Framework docs).

	* BinaryWriter.cs: Store data in little-endian format.
	Use internal buffer for conversions.

2002-03-31  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Directory.cs: Strip out "." and ".." from returned list

	* StreamReader.cs : Fill out, add buffering, and use encoding.

2002-03-19  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* StreamWriter.cs (StreamWriter (string)): The default is to override
	the file, not to append to it.
	(StreamWriter (string path, bool append)): When appending, seek to the
	end of the file, otherwise truncate the file to zero length.
	(Dispose (bool)): Close the internalStream.
	(Flush): Flush the interalStream.

	* Directory.cs: Changed to use SearchPattern instead of mono_glob_*()

2002/03/15 Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* DirectoryInfo.cs: Fixed the overloaded GetDirectories and GetFiles.
	This code seemed to be copied from somewhere, and it was close,
	but didn't match the docs.  This was the last bit needed to get
	NAnt to compile with our class libs.

2002-03-12  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* EndOfStreamException.cs:
	* FileLoadException.cs:

	int, so just make it a normal Enum.

2002-03-02  Jason Diamond  <jason@injektilo.org>

	* StringReader.cs: Fixed off-by-one error in Peek() and Read().

2002-02-12  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* BufferedStream.cs: Initial implemenation.  The synchronous
	methods for both reading and writing are implemented.  I'll do the
	asynchronous methods in a bit.
	
Wed Jan  9 16:04:39 MST 2002 Matt Kimball <matt@kimball.net>

	* BinaryWriter.cs: Initial implementation.  And it's all there.

2001-07-19  Marcin Szczepanski <marcins@zipworld.com.au>

	* System.IO.MemoryStream.cs: Added.  Had quite a few cases of
	"LAMESPEC", but the tests work against the MS implementation so
	the major functions are right (ie. Read/Write/Seek).  Some more
	tests required for the various constructors and exceptions.
