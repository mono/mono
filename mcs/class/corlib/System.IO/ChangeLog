	* FileInfo.cs:
	  - Exists: If file does not exists when instance is created the
	  value of the Exists property does not change even if file is created
	  afterwards.
	  - Delete: If path is a directory UnauthorizedException is thrown.
	  - CopyTo: Now we can overwrite file if wanted.

	because we need to implement the method on Windows.
	* Path.cs 
	(CanonicalizePath) Added new function to get
	rid of . and .. in path names. Need to figure out what
	other functions should call this.

2003-04-20  Igor Nosyryev <nosyryev@attbi.com>

	* StringReader.cs (Read): Increment nextChar by charsToRead
	instead of count, that will guarantee that the next time the
	method is called, it will return 0 on an empty string rather than
	throwing an exception

2003-04-19  Ville Palo <vi64pa@kolumbus.fi>

	* BufferedStream.cs: Some fixes, mostly throwing exceptions.

	ObjectDisposedException if the handle has been released.
	
	(Read): Throw exceptions specified in the spec.

	(Read, Write, ReadSegment, WriteSegment): There is no requirement for any

	the new MemoryStreamTest.

2003-03-05  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	SetCreationTime, SetLastAccessTime and SetLastWriteTime.

2003-02-26  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* MemoryStream.cs:
	(ToArray): return only the portion of the buffer that contains
	data, not the whole buffer. (note: this makes XmlDocument.Load work
	again with documents that have a <?xml without the 'encoding'
	attribute, which makes gtk-sharp generator work again).

2003-02-25  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* MemoryStream.cs: create the buffer of the specified capacity.

2003-01-31  Patrik Torstensson

	* MemoryStream.cs: use BlockCopyInternal instead of Array.Copy, this is
	the same way as MS does it (performance improvement)

	too, not only with relative ones.

2002-12-07  Peter Williams  <peterw@ximian.com>

	* StreamWriter.cs: Changed all Encoding.UTF8 to Encoding.UTF8Unmarked.

2002-10-31  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* FileStream.cs: Fix buffering properly this time.  Also kludge
	around broken pipe errors, treating them as EOF instead of
	throwing an IO exception.

	GetLastError() value has long since been blown away if we try and
	look it up in a subsequent internal call invocation.

	* FileSystemInfo.cs:

	* File.cs:

	calls to MonoIO.Seek.  Fixed buffering in Read() so that it
	doesn't block forever on short reads.

	* MonoIO.cs: Added GetFileType

2002-10-21  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	\n (this is what MS does).

2002-10-18  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* FileStream.cs: SeekOrigin.End still calculates the offset from
	the end of the file with positive values extending the length.

	* FileStream.cs: Do not call FSync on the file.

2002-09-16  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* TextWriter.cs (Null): The Null field should be an instance of a
	TextWriter class that does nothing, so it is an instance of the
	NullTextWriter class.

2002-09-16  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* MemoryStream.cs (Close): Don't throw an exception if the stream
	is already closed.

2002-09-15  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* FileStream.cs (Dispose): Call FlushBuffer(), and not Flush, as
	Flush calls fsync().  

	The API docs show no explicit mention that Flush() should even do
	an fsync, I am thinking that we should drop that from the
	runtime. 

2002-09-09  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* StreamWriter.cs: When no encoding is provided, create an
	encoding without markers, this is what MS does.

	the build for gtk#.

2002-08-27  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* BinaryReader.cs:
	* BinaryWriter.cs:
	* MemoryStream.cs:
	* StreamReader.cs:
	* StreamWriter.cs:

	that there is no directory information about the path.

2002-08-20  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* FileNotFoundException.cs: use Message and InnerException from base
	class. Changed Message and ToString ().

	chars

	* StreamReader.cs: Guard against ^\n lines as pointed out by Gonzalo.

2002-07-02  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

2002-05-17  Dan Lewis  <dihlewis@yahoo.co.uk>

	* FileStream.cs: Enforce lower bound on buffer size.

2002-05-16  Piers Haken <piersh@friskit.com>

	* Stream.cs: Implement synchronous {Begin|End}{Read|Write}() methods.

2002-05-17  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* Path.cs (GetDirectoryName): Return String.Empty if there is no
	directory

	exist.

2002-05-08  Mike Gray     <mikeg@mikegray.org>

2002-05-07  Mike Gray     <mikeg_us@hotmail.com>

	use new internal class since null cannot be passed to constructor 
	anymore. Also, fix a coule of small bugs.

2002-05-03  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* MemoryStream.cs: Refrain from allocating array until the space is
	really needed. This fixes a bug in the Length property when the
	constructor without the byte array is used.

2002-05-01  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* DirectoryNotFoundException.cs (constructor): Added missing
	serialization constructor.

2002/03/15 Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* DirectoryInfo.cs: Fixed the overloaded GetDirectories and GetFiles.
	This code seemed to be copied from somewhere, and it was close,
	but didn't match the docs.  This was the last bit needed to get
	NAnt to compile with our class libs.

2001-07-19  Marcin Szczepanski <marcins@zipworld.com.au>

	* System.IO.MemoryStream.cs: Added.  Had quite a few cases of
	"LAMESPEC", but the tests work against the MS implementation so
	the major functions are right (ie. Read/Write/Seek).  Some more
	tests required for the various constructors and exceptions.
