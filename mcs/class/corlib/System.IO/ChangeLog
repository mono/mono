        *SeekOrigin.cs.cs, FileShare.cs, FileMode.cs, FileAccess.cs: Add.

2001-07-19  Marcin Szczepanski <marcins@zipworld.com.au>

	* System.IO.MemoryStream.cs: Added.  Had quite a few cases of
	"LAMESPEC", but the tests work against the MS implementation so
	the major functions are right (ie. Read/Write/Seek).  Some more
	tests required for the various constructors and exceptions.

	* StringReader.cs, StringWriter.cs, TextReader.cs, TextWriter.cs:
	New class implemenations.

	* StringReaderTest.cs, StringWriterTest.cs: Test suite for the above.
