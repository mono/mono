	* DataConverter.cs: Fix the PutBytesLE and PutByteBE, they were
	overwriting memory that was out of range.    

	Fix based on patch from Luis Gomes.

	A couple of fixes to compile with MS.NET 2.0 (from Luis as well).

	* a.cs: Test this stuff.

	* DataConverter.cs: Implement Paolo's suggestion: provide a
	PutBytes interface that stores data into an existing byte array
	and make the GetBytes operations be wrappers around PutBytes.
