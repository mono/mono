2004-11-23  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* PKCS1.cs: Merge from HEAD. Fix PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption when the 
	ciphertext isn't exactly the same of the public key and some level 4 
	compiler warnings.

2004-09-29  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* RSAManaged.cs: KeySize is now always a multiple of 8 bits. 
	Fix #66929.

2004-06-23  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SymmetricTransform.cs: Reduce by one the number of block when 
	decrypting. This operation was in CryptoStream before but is only
	required for decryption (which CryptoStream can't know). 
	Fix bug #60573.

2004-05-27  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SymmetricTransform.cs: Fixed possible integer overflow. Added 
	missing exception handling in TransformBlock and TransformFinalBlock.

2004-05-01  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CryptoConvert.cs: Synched with Mono.Security.dll. Fix bug #57941 
	(truncated key pair).
	* RSAManaged.cs: Synched with Mono.Security.dll. Fix bug #57941 
	(truncated key pair).

2004-04-28  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CryptoConvert.cs: In sync with Mono.Security.dll version.
	* CryptoTools.cs: In sync with Mono.Security.dll version.
	* DSAManaged.cs: Changed delegate to please FxCop.
	* PKCS1.cs: In sync with Mono.Security.dll version.
	* RSAManaged.cs: In sync with Mono.Security.dll version.
	* SymmetricTransform.cs: Fixed a bug when offset > 0 in destination
	buffer. Changed Array.Copy to Buffer.BlockCopy.

2004-04-23  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* KeyPairPersistence.cs: Completed key pair protection for both
	Linux and Windows (protection done by runtime).

2004-04-08  Bernie Solomon  <bernard@ugsolutions.com>

	* PKCS1.cs: Use BitConverterLE

2004-04-06  Bernie Solomon  <bernard@ugsolutions.com>

	* CryptoConvert.cs: Add private methods to always
	handle data as little endian (GetBytesLE, ToInt32LE, ToUInt32LE).

2004-03-23  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CryptoConvert.cs: Added support for public keys preceded by an 
	header like the one generated by "sn -e".

2004-03-23  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CryptoConvert.cs: Added exception for null and bad parameters.
	* RSAManaged.cs: CryptographicException thrown when trying to export
	the private key when only the public key is present (CRT aware).

2004-03-22  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CryptoConvert.cs: Added new methods to convert [From|To]Hex. Added
	new version of FromCapiPublicKeyBlob with an integer offset.

2004-02-06  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* DSAManaged.cs: Added an event after key generation (so that
	DSACryptoServiceProvider can persist the keypair if required). Added
	PublicOnly property (like 1.2) so we do not have to catch an exception
	to know if a private key is present or not. Added a Random property so
	we do not always have to create a RNG instance (not always required).
	* RSAManaged.cs: Added an event after key generation (so that
	DSACryptoServiceProvider can persist the keypair if required). Added
	PublicOnly property (like 1.2) so we do not have to catch an exception
	to know if a private key is present or not.
	* SymmetricTransform.cs: This class was split from S.S.C.
	SymmetricAlgorithm.cs so it could be reused in Mono.Security 
	assembly for other symmetric algorithms transforms.

2004-02-05  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* KeyPairPersistence.cs: New. Class to persist keypairs in an XML
	format to mimic the CryptoAPI key containers.

2004-01-12  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* CryptoConvert.cs: RSA doesn't start with a Q - at least that what
	a strongname told me. Sorry Ron :(

2003-12-15  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* MACAlgorithm.cs: Fixed difference between 1.0 and 1.1 framework. 
	The 1.0 framework is adding an additional  padding block (empty) 
	to MAC when MACing an exact multiple of the TripleDES block size.
	* PKCS1.cs: Fixed a typo which prevented "lame" (without OID) 
	signature verification.

2003-10-30  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* CryptoConvert.cs: Fixed strongname generation for small exponents 
	(like 17). Part of the fixed for bug #50341.

2003-10-17  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* CryptoConvert.cs: Added from Mono.Security to support StrongNames.

2003-07-05  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* DSAManaged.cs: Fixed bugs that appeared with the new unit tests.
	* RSAManaged.cs: Fixed bugs that appeared with the new unit tests.

2003-07-02  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* PKCS1.cs DSAManaged.cs: Changed strange characters in comments to 
	human-readable ones, since they break XML export in monocov.

2003-06-15  Sebastien Pouliot <spouliot@motus.com>

	* RSAManaged.cs: Now includes CRT (Chinese Remainder Theorem) 
	optimization when using the private key (DecryptValue). This
	cut more than 5 seconds of nunit on my system (out of 14 sec
	for complete asymmetric tests). Thanks to Ben Maurer for help!

2003-06-11  Sebastien Pouliot <spouliot@motus.com>

	* DSAManaged.cs: Refactored from DSACryptoServiceProvider.cs. Cannot
	be reused outside [ms]corlib because DSA constructor is internal :-(

	* PKCS1.cs: Now support any hash algorithm when encoding PKCS 1.5
	(i.e. not limited to pre-calculated values for known hashes). Some
	other API changes to ease the use of other hash algorithms.

	* RSAManaged.cs: Refactored from RSACryptoServiceProvider.cs. This 
	class is required for custom PKCS#1 padding in SSL (which is not 
	possible using RSACryptoServiceProvider).

2003-05-12  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* PKCS1.cs: Corrected I2OSP to match PKCS#1 v.2.1 test vector
	and fix the OAEP incompatibility issue.

2003-04-01  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* PKCS1.cs: Corrected fix (partially) for the lame PKCS1 v1.5
	signatures done without specifying an OID.
	
2003-03-01  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* PKCS1.cs: Fix for some (lame) PKCS1 v1.5 signatures done
	without specifying an OID.

2003-02-08  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* CryptoTools.cs: Renamed namespace to match new location.
	* PKCS1.cs: Renamed namespace to match new location.
	* HMACAlgorithm.cs: New. Generic class to implement HMAC
	using any hash algorithm (was in S.S.C.HMACSHA1.cs).
	* MACAlgorithm.cs: New. Generic class to implement MAC
	using any symmetric algorithm (was in S.S.C.MACTripleDES.cs).
