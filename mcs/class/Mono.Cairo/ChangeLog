	* Mono.Cairo/Cairo.cs: csc was having trouble resolving the type
	name because the namespace name (Cairo) is the same as the class
	name (also Cairo). To resolve this ambiguity while keeping the
	code looking decent, the Cairo.Cairo class is now Cairo.CairoAPI.

	* Mono.Cairo/Cairo.cs: Now that the namespace is called 'Cairo',
	the enums no longer need to be nested inside the Cairo class.

	* Mono.Cairo/Matrix.cs:
	* Mono.Cairo/Object.cs:
	* Mono.Cairo/Surface.cs: I never liked having the word 'Object' in
	the name of a class, esp. now that we have namespaces. So I have
	decided to rename them.

		CairoObject        -> Cairo.Object
		CairoMatrixObject  -> Cairo.Matrix
		CairoSurfaceObject -> Cairo.Surface

	I didn't like the Mono.Cairo namespace either, so they're just in
	the Cairo namespace now. I know it's icky that the directory is
	called Mono.Cairo, and the dll we write to is called
	'Mono.Cairo.dll', and yet the namespace now gonna just be 'Cairo'
	and not 'Mono.Cairo'. C'est la vie.

	* Mono.Cairo/CairoObject.cs (Pattern): Re-enable this. This
	is actually a CairoSurfaceObject (a C cairo_surface_t); the
	CairoPatternObject is just something I made up...
