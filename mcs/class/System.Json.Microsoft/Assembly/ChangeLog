	* AssemblyInfo.cs : use the same pub key in 2.0 (dummy), to ease
	  testing locally.

2008-05-07  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* AssemblyInfo.cs: Remove AssemblyDelaySign(true) since it's
	not always needed and can be controlled from the Makefile.
	Adjust public key for System.Windows (InternalsVisibleTo)
