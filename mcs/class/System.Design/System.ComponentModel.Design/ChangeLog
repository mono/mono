	* CollectionEditor.cs: 
	 - Fix CreateCollectionItemType to deal with "Item" overloads.
	 - Implement Create/DestroyInstance to check for the 
	   IDesignerHost service and use that.
	 - Check if SetItems produces a new object(will happen for arrays)
	   and update EditValue.

2006-11-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* ComponentDesigner.cs: Remove a few exceptions being thrown from
	a few popular calls.   This will just make code that is
	automatically generated to run, it will not actually provide any
	real designer functionality.

	* ComponentDesigner.cs: Added a call to GC.SuppressFinalize in Dispose
	method (even if we throw an NotImplementedException afterward). This
	will remove warnings from gendarme.
