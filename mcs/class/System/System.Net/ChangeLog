	* HttpRequestCreator.cs: added internal .ctor.

2003-06-24  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: SetWriteStream(): SendRequestHeaders should be
	called before asyncWrite.SetCompleted, to make sure that the waiting
	thread does not start to send more information before
	SendRequestHeaders has finished.

2003-06-22  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* WebConnectionStream.cs: Only increment pendingReads if an asynchronous
	read is really needed.

2003-06-20  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WebHeaderCollection.cs: prevent duplication headers used niternally.

2003-06-14  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: if CookieContainer has not been set, make
	HttpWebResponse ignore Set-Cookie* headers.

	* HttpWebResponse.cs: Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie headers removed if
	CookieContainer have been provided to the request.

2003-06-13  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

2003-06-13  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: *really* take care of requestSent to prevent
	sending the same request twice.
	* WebAsyncResult.cs: don't close the handle. Just Reset.
	* WebConnectionStream.cs: removed unneeded line.

2003-06-12  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: use InternalClose when we are not going to send the
	rest of the request stream because of an error after sending the
	headers.

	* WebConnection.cs: check for completion after setting the response.
	Enable reading in NextRead.

	* WebConnectionStream.cs: re-fixed the count for partially buffered
	reads. If the network stream returns 0 bytes, we're done.

2003-06-11  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WebClient.cs: implemented UploadFile. Fixed SetupRequest to set the
	special headers *after* the others.

2003-06-10  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WebConnectionStream.cs: when the read is partially filled from the
	initial buffer, add those bytes too. Thanks to Lluis for debugging this.

2003-06-09  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: added ExpectContinue property.
	* WebConnection.cs: allow 100 Continue to be delayed after waiting for
	it.

2003-06-08  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: don't send "Expect: 100-continue" is the server
	is known not to respond to that.

	* ServicePoint.cs: added SendContinue property.

	* WebConnection.cs: only wait 2 seconds for a continue reply. If it
	timeouts, set SendContinue to false and proceeed sending data.

	* WebConnectionStream.cs: if 100-continue is not received and instead we
	get a 417 or anything else, don't send the data.

	* WebClient.cs: implemented all missing properties and methods except
	UploadFile.

2003-06-06  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* FileWebRequestCreator.cs: splitted from WebRequest.
	* HttpRequestCreator.cs: splitted fromWebRequest.

2003-05-30  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs (EndGetResponse): Do not throw exceptions on
	InternalServerError (500)

2003-05-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs (Close): Move the code that accumulates the
	output to Close from Flush.  Flush could have been called in the
	middle of the processing, and would have generated invalid results
	(which it did).

2003-05-23  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* Dns.cs (GetHostByAddress): Return the local host when called with
	IF_ANY.

2003-04-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* WebClient.cs (DownloadData): Close the underlyng stream.
	(DownloadFile): Use using, so the file gets closed.

2003-04-24  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* WebClient.cs (DownloadData): Instead of using a MemoryStream,
	keep track of all the small chunks in an ArrayList.  The
	MemoryStream had the property of reallocating itself, and the
	problem was that MemoryStream.GetBuffer would return the buffer
	(correctly), but not something of the right size.  So clients of
	DownloadData would get the extra unused bytes as part of the
	result.

	The solution would have been to make another copy at this point,
	instead, we only keep the small allocations around in the
	ArrayList, and we only do one large allocation at the end.

	* HttpWebResponse.cs: If there is a Content-Length header, pass
	this information to our HttpWebResponseStream, so it knows when to
	stop, instead of waiting for the stream to be shut down by the
	other end.

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: Only set the `delay-header-writing' mode on
	the underlying stream if the method will do a content transfer and
	no Content-Length was provided. If not (HEAD and GET or
	Content-Length provided), keep going.
	
2003-04-23  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: .NET Allows the HttpWebRequest to not have
	the ContentLength specified on the request.  If that happens, we
	have to accumulate all the data written, and once we accumulate
	the data, we send it off.  

	Notice that the documentation in .NET is actually incorrect, they
	state that setting ContentLength is mandatory.  It is not.

2003-04-12  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebResponse.cs: fixes bug #41180.

2003-03-25  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: throw an exception is the response code is >= 300.

2003-03-07  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: implemented IDisposable, make the request stream
	read only. Changed the way of disposing the socket.

	* HttpWebResponse.cs: wrapped the socket in a write-only NetworkStream,
	handle chunked transfer encoding (no more hangs), added serialization
	stuff, call CheckDisposed at the beginning of methods/properties (not
	in a finally clause).

2003-02-17  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* WebClient.cs : Implemented Credentials property.

2003-02-04  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* SocketAddress.cs: byte 1 of the data is the high byte of the family,
	not the size.

2003-01-29  Atsushi Enomoto <ginga@kit.hi-ho.ne.jp>

	* WebClient.cs : hacked OpenRead, DownloadData and DownloadFile.

2002-10-24  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: applied patch from Tim Haynes
	(thaynes@openlinksw.com).

	Avoided double-sending of the request to the server when both
	GetRequestStream() and GetResponse() are called.
	System Header attributes survive the Headers attribute set.
	Added handling of Connection: KeepAlive/Close

2002-10-03  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>
