	* WebConnection.cs: handle errors on chunked streams. Fixes bug #66858.
	* ChunkStream.cs: added error checking all over.

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: throw the exception received in SetResponseError
	if we already have a response.
	(SetRequestData): Don't nest the exception if it's a WebException.

2004-12-03 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WebConnection.cs: remove prevStream and don't set busy to false in
	HandleError. prevStream is not needed any more and setting 'busy' so
	early might let a request skip the queue.
	
	* WebConnectionGroup.cs: decrement the indexer when removing a dead
	reference from the arraylist.

	* WebConnectionStream.cs:
	(ReadAll): call NextRead if it has not been called before even when
	we have completed the request. Reuse the read buffer when reading a
	response of unknown size. Increase the buffer to 8kB.
	(BeginRead): increase pendingReads earlier and even when reading from
	the internal buffer.
	(EndRead): decrease pendingReads later and always.

2004-12-01 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* CookieCollection.cs: reformatted, fixed Add by adding a new method to
	search across the arraylist, as list.IndexOf is not what we want.

2004-11-19 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WebConnection.cs: check for FIN or RST on the socket before reusing.
	Fixes bug #69388.

2004-11-09 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ChunkStream.cs: simplified condition for WantMore property.

	* WebConnection.cs: in Connect(), finish any pending reads we might
	have for chunked data. Ignore possible blank lines at the very
	beginning of the server response. Honor user set KeepAlive in
	HttpWebRequest for HTTP/1.1 connections. Thanks to Eyal Alayuf for
	his suggestions and code.

2004-11-01 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebResponse.cs: don't lock up when the cookie received ends with
	a semicolon. Patch by Darryl VanDorp. Fixes bug #68956.

2004-10-27 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: don't fail if the request has already been sent
	when accessing ContentType setter. Fixes bug #68848.

2004-10-25 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ChunkStream.cs:
	(WantMore): we're not done until we get a 0 chunk size and the trailer.
	The 0 can be expressed as more than one character too (ie, 000000).

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: new argument in SetResponseError.
	* WebConnection.cs: added argument to HandleError as a hint for
	debugging.
	(Connect): make the chunked stream be in the expected state when
	reusing.

	* WebConnectionStream.cs: removed unused method (ResetWriteBuffer).

2004-10-11 David Sheldon <dave-mono@earth.li>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: Use RemoveAndAdd for AddRange. Fixes unittest. 

2004-10-04 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: ProxyQuery returns true when we use a proxy without
	tunneling a secure connection.

	* ServicePoint.cs: added UseConnect property.

	* ServicePointManager.cs: set the UseConnect property when we use a http
	proxy for a https connection.

	* WebConnection.cs: setup the tunnled connection when using a proxy and
	https.

2004-10-04 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: ProxyQuery returns true when we use a proxy without
	tunneling a secure connection.

	* ServicePoint.cs: added UseConnect property.

	* ServicePointManager.cs: set the UseConnect property when we use a http
	proxy for a https connection.

2004-08-11 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Cookie.cs: don't fail when using default constructor. Fixes bug
	#62890.

2004-08-11 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebResponse.cs: set-cookie and set-cookie2 can be present more
	than once and have multiple values. Don't rely on string.split when
	parsing cookie values.

	* WebHeaderCollection.cs: same thing for set-cookie and set-cookie2.
	Fixed GetValues (it was splitting values that contained a comma) and
	changed SetInternal to handle multi-value headers.

	Fixes bug #62744.

2004-07-26 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WebProxy.cs: fix scheme detection. Patch by Konstantin Triger
	(kostat@mainsoft.com).

2004-07-16 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: detect changes in scheme or port when redirecting.
	Fixes las take on bug 61218.

2004-07-14 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WebConnection.cs: moved loading of the ssl stream Type to its own
	method. Don't create a new ssl stream if we're reusing the connection.

	* WebConnectionStream.cs: ensure the number of bytes copied in ReadAll
	is the expected even if the dta from the server has extra bytes.

2004-07-12 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WebConnection.cs:
	* WebConnectionStream.cs: when the status code is 1xx, 204 or 304,
	"responses MUST NOT include a message-body". We tried to read the
	stream even when getting those codes and considered the 0 length
	read as a failure.

2004-07-09 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: removed bogus Monitor.Exit.
	* WebConnection.cs: use Address instead of RequestUri when checking for
	the scheme in order to select the stream type. Fixes bug #61218.

	* ChunkStream.cs: added ChunkLeft property.
	* WebConnection.cs:
	(EndRead): when using small byte arrays to read from a chunked stream,
	ensure we've read the chunk size and try to fulfill the request
	completely. fixes bug 59653.

2004-05-29  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WebConnectionStream.cs: fixed CanRead property. Closes bug #59273.

2004-05-28  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* DigestClient.cs: cache the sessions based on address and
	credentials, not only address. Added poor men's expiration to
	the session cache. Fixes bug #59202.

2004-05-26  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* IPAddress.cs:
	* IPEndPoint.cs:
	* IPv6Address.cs: no more warnings about IPAddress.Address.

2004-05-18  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WebException.cs: implemented serialization .ctor and
	GetObjectData().

2004-05-13  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WebAsyncResult.cs: don't create the WaitHandle if not needed.

2004-05-13  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	used yet.

	* NetConfig.cs: added MaxResponseHeadersLength field.

	* ServicePoint.cs:
	* ServicePointManager.cs: added missing properties for 1.1. 

2004-05-03  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* WebConnection.cs: Use assembly name const to load Mono.Security.

2004-05-03  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* NtlmClient.cs: Use assembly name const to load Mono.Security.

2004-04-24  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WebConnectionStream.cs: avoid the exception when getting the content
	length if possible.

2004-03-29  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: Use a lock block instead of Monitor.Enter/Exit, so
	the lock is released in case of exception (for example, a 
	ThreadAbortException). This also "fixes" bug #52417.
	Beware, this requires a runtime update (due to a bug in Monitor.Exit).
	* ServicePoint.cs: Changed method from internal to private, since it
	is not called from outside the class.

2004-03-24  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: added the exception status to the error message.
	* WebConnection.cs: add headers using SetInternal instead of Add to
	bypass header name validation. Fixes bug #55994.
	* WebHeaderCollection.cs: added SetInternal (string header).

2004-03-04  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WebConnection.cs:
	* WebConnectionGroup.cs: the requests queue is now shared for all the
	connections belonging to the same connection group.

2004-02-26  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* DefaultCertificatePolicy.cs: New. Certificate validation
	policy compatible with the documented one present in Fx. It
	allows valid certificates and expired certificates to be used
	for SSL connections.
	* ServicePointManager.cs: Removed the DummyPolicy. Now creates
	a DefaultCertificatePolicy to validate certificates. 

2004-02-26  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ServicePoint.cs: SendContinue is always false for HTTP/1.0

	* WebConnection.cs: get rid of WaitForContinue() (yes!) and prevent
	calling more the ContinueDelegate more than once when we get the
	headers in several packets.

	* WebConnectionStream.cs: removed call to WaitForContinue.

2004-02-25  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* WebConnection.cs: Update previous patch to use HttpsClientStream
	(internal in Mono.Security assembly) in place of SslClientStream.
	This will reduce reflection and allow to use ICertificatePolicy.

2004-02-25  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* DigestClient.cs: fix quote handling. Reordered attributes in response.
	Fixed typo (QOP->CNonce). Now Digest works with apache2.

2004-02-25  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* DigestClient.cs: removed Console.
	* HttpWebRequest.cs: 401/407 were hanging for GET. Fixed.

2004-02-24  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* DigestClient.cs: Fixed issue with Apache server which do not use "
	for specifying the digest algorithm (.e.g. algorithm=MD5 not ="MD5").

2004-02-20  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: arghhh. I used the server response headers instead
	of what the client is supposed to send. Thanks to Helge Hess.

2004-02-19  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* AuthenticationManager.cs: implemented PreAuthenticate().

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: once we know the version of the server, use it if
	below the requested one. Remove 'Expect', 'Content-Length' and /or 
	'Transfer-Encoding' if appropiate due to changes in version. Fixed 
	'Host' header for non-standard ports. Support preauthentication. Closes
	bug #50530.

2004-02-19  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: check for missing or wrong URI in Location header
	when redirecting.

	* WebConnection.cs: if the data read does not contain all the headers,
	keep it around and read the rest until we get to the response body.
	Allow response code with no description. Fixed bug #54543.

2004-02-18  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SecurityProtocolType.cs: Added missing [Serializable] to enum. Added 
	Default and Ssl2 to NET_2_0 profile. Enum is now internal for NET_1_0
	profile (as we need it for SslClientStream).
	* ServicePoint.cs: Added internal SetCertificates(client,server).
	* ServicePointManager.cs: Added CheckCertificateRevocationList and
	CheckCertificateRevocationList static properties (public in 1.1, 
	internal for 1.0).
	* WebConnection.cs: Dynamically creates a SslClientStream (from 
	Mono.Security assembly) in case of https. Changed NetworkStream to 
	Stream everywhere.

2004-02-18  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: send the 'Connection: keep-alive' header when we
	don't know the server version or it's 1.0.

	* ServicePoint.cs: added SetVersion.

	* WebAsyncResult.cs: remove ChunkAsyncResult.

	* WebConnection.cs: set the ServicePoint version when getting a response
	from the server.

	* WebConnectionStream.cs: when posting chunked content, send the head,
	body and trailer of the chunk at once instead of doing 3 separate
	writes, which may cause troubles.

2004-02-18  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WebConnection.cs: if we get a 100 when we're not waiting for it, set
	that information in the ServicePoint.

	* WebConnectionStream.cs: send headers in the right order for
	non-chunked POST.

2004-02-17  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WebConnectionStream.cs: fixed nullrefs in BeginWrite/EndWrite.

2004-02-17  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: on second and sucesive tries when authenticating,
	don't use chunked encoding for POST, as we know the content length and
	have the body. Nullify bodyBuffer always in CheckFinalStatus.

	* WebAsyncResult.cs: added ChunkAsyncResult property. It holds the
	IAsyncResult when writing CRLF at the end of a chunk.

	* WebConnectionStream.cs: support sending chunked data.

2004-01-24  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: When retrying a POST request after an
	authentication failure, resend the body. This fixes bug #51841.
	* WebConnectionStream.cs: Added properties for getting what's been
	written.

2004-02-12  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: don't send 'Expect: 100-continue' for 1.0 version.

2004-02-12  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: support proxy authentication.

2004-02-12  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* BasicClient.cs:
	* DigestClient.cs: use IndexOf instead of StartsWith to deal with
	servers that provide several authentication schemas.

2004-02-12  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ChunkStream.cs: use an array of buffers instead of a MemoryStream for
	storing the chunks. This way, we won't miss traling data from the
	previous chunk when a new one is received before the other is fully
	read.

2004-01-27  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@ieee.org>

	* DigestClient.cs:
	* HttpWebRequest.cs:
	* IPv6Address.cs:
	* WebClient.cs:
	* WebConnection.cs:
	* WebConnectionStream.cs: Remove unused variables thus eliminating some
	build warnings.

2004-01-26  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WebConnection.cs: patch by Yaacov Akiba Slama that fixes 100-continue
	handling for the case when the same packet also contains the actual
	[2-5]xx response.

2004-01-24  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: Added missing property.

2004-01-23  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Dns.cs: don't block forever in EndResolve and EndGetHostByName. Fixes
	bug #53222.

2004-01-16  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* ChunkStream.cs: The "size" parameter of Write is not the number of
	bytes to write, but the last offset to be written. Thus, in WriteAndRead
	Back, since "read" is not an offset but the number of bytes, it must be 
	added to the offset. Maybe it would be a good idea to change the name of
	the parameter, since it is confusing. This should fix bug #52591.

2004-01-12  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* WebConnection.cs: Yet another fix for WebConnection. This fixes 
	bug #52169.

2004-01-09  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WebConnection.cs: Data.Init is a bad boy. Lluis realized. He also
	tidied up the end of ReadDone. Disabled relaunching the request if 2
	InitRead are called, since now we don't throw everything into
	RegisterWaitForSingleObject but one request at a time.

	* WebConnectionGroup.cs: when checking available connections, allow them
	not to be Connected but allocated to honor the connection limit.
	
	* WebConnectionStream.cs: CheckComplete() now checks for nextReadCalled
	too. ReadAll don't mess contentLength if it's provided in the headers.

	BIG thanks to Lluis. Turns out that we were debugging the same stuff and
	his Data.Init discovery was THE thing I was missing.

	Fixes bug #51277.

2004-01-09  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ServicePointManager.cs: use GetMaxConnections to get the appropiate
	number of connections limit.

2004-01-09  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* MonoHttpDate.cs: use the invariant culture, not en-US. Suspected
	guilty for bug 52629.

2003-12-16  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* CredentialCache.cs: return null instead of throwing NotImplemented.

2003-12-12  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: fixed checking if method allows a body. Patch by
	Benjamin Jemlich (pcgod@gmx.net).

2003-12-12  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: deal with authentication schemes that have more
	than 1 round trip (Ntlm).

2003-12-11  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* NtlmClient.cs: new class that actually uses one from Mono.Http to do
	the authentication.

2003-12-02  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: when building the redirect URI, use the previous
	one as the base URI, which makes relative URIs work.

2003-12-02  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* DigestClient.cs: merged in code from Sebastien Pouliot and Greg
	Reinacker that Supports cnonce and preauthentication.

2003-12-02  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* DigestClient.cs: initial Digest authentication. Works with apache
	mod_digest.

2003-11-27  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: removed unneeded StringBuilder.
	* WebConnection.cs: default to keep the connection open for HTTP/1.1
	only or HTTP/1.0 + (Proxy-)Connection header. Fixes bug #51208.

2003-11-17  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WebConnection.cs: turns out that socket.Connected is not useful until
	we actually try to send/receive data, even if the other end has already
	closed the socket. Added TryReconnect() and Connected.

	* WebConnectionData.cs: default value for StatusCode is 0 now.

	* WebConnectionGroup.cs: reuse the connection since the beginning,
	instead of opening up to ConnectionLimit and then reusing.

	* WebConnectionStream.cs: reopen the socket if we're trying to reuse
	one which fails on first write.

2003-11-14  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WebConnectionStream.cs: when a callback is passed to BeginRead/Write,
	wrap it and do our job before calling it. Fixes bug #48497.

2003-11-12  Andreas Nahr <ClassDevelopment@A-SoftTech.com>

	* WebExceptionStatus.cs: Restyled, Added .Net 1.1 members
	* SecurityProtocolType.cs: Added and implemented

2003-11-06  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* IPAddress.cs: prevent exceptions when trying to parse the static IPv6
	addresses.

2003-10-17  Pedro Martínez Juliá  <yoros@wanadoo.es>

	* WebClient.cs: use Path.DirectorySeparator instead of "/" for
	windows compatibility. Add some checks for file paths like
	"C:/xxx/yyy/..." and like "/home/xxx/...".

2003-10-16  Pedro Martínez Juliá  <yoros@wanadoo.es>

	* WebClient.cs: added a slash between directory and file names.

2003-10-13  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs:
	* HttpWebResponse.cs: better abort handling and leave the stream in a
	stable status on abort.

2003-10-12  Pedro Martínez Juliá  <yoros@wanadoo.es>

	* WebClient.cs: refine reading of local files (like MS.NET).

2003-10-10  Pedro Martínez Juliá  <yoros@wanadoo.es>

	* WebClient.cs: MS.NET works right when we try OpenRead("file.txt")
	but we didn't. Now, when Uri fails with an exception, it adds
	"file://" before the URI and tries again.

2003-10-09  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ServicePoint.cs: preparing for recycling. Not yet finished.
	* ServicePointManager.cs: this is the one that reads config.
	* WebConnectionGroup.cs: don't read config here.

	Initialize the connection data in a place where it does not depend on
	the execution order of the requests in threadpool. More error handling.

	* WebConnectionGroup.cs: use the limits in the config file and reuse
	connections when the limit is reached.

2003-10-02  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: handle 304 à la MS.
	* WebConnection.cs: set the response data when reading 0 bytes.

	invalid state.

2003-08-14  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* WebRequest.cs: Check lower case string since that is what we will add.

2003-08-04  Jerome Laban <jlaban@wanadoo.fr>

	called before asyncWrite.SetCompleted, to make sure that the waiting
	thread does not start to send more information before
	SendRequestHeaders has finished.

2003-06-22  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* WebConnectionStream.cs: Only increment pendingReads if an asynchronous
	read is really needed.

	rest of the request stream because of an error after sending the
	headers.

	* WebConnection.cs: check for completion after setting the response.
	Enable reading in NextRead.

	* WebConnectionStream.cs: re-fixed the count for partially buffered
	reads. If the network stream returns 0 bytes, we're done.

	* WebClient.cs: implemented UploadFile. Fixed SetupRequest to set the
	special headers *after* the others.

2003-06-10  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	get a 417 or anything else, don't send the data.

	* WebClient.cs: implemented all missing properties and methods except
	UploadFile.

2003-06-06  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	Reworked HttpWebRequest and related classes.

2003-05-30  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs (EndGetResponse): Do not throw exceptions on
	InternalServerError (500)

2003-05-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs (Close): Move the code that accumulates the
	output to Close from Flush.  Flush could have been called in the
	middle of the processing, and would have generated invalid results
	(which it did).

2003-05-23  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* Dns.cs (GetHostByAddress): Return the local host when called with
	IF_ANY.

2003-04-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* WebClient.cs (DownloadData): Close the underlyng stream.
	(DownloadFile): Use using, so the file gets closed.

2003-04-24  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* WebClient.cs (DownloadData): Instead of using a MemoryStream,
	keep track of all the small chunks in an ArrayList.  The
	MemoryStream had the property of reallocating itself, and the
	problem was that MemoryStream.GetBuffer would return the buffer
	(correctly), but not something of the right size.  So clients of
	DownloadData would get the extra unused bytes as part of the
	result.

	The solution would have been to make another copy at this point,
	instead, we only keep the small allocations around in the
	ArrayList, and we only do one large allocation at the end.

	* HttpWebResponse.cs: If there is a Content-Length header, pass
	this information to our HttpWebResponseStream, so it knows when to
	stop, instead of waiting for the stream to be shut down by the
	other end.

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: Only set the `delay-header-writing' mode on
	the underlying stream if the method will do a content transfer and
	no Content-Length was provided. If not (HEAD and GET or
	Content-Length provided), keep going.
	
2003-04-23  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: .NET Allows the HttpWebRequest to not have
	the ContentLength specified on the request.  If that happens, we
	have to accumulate all the data written, and once we accumulate
	the data, we send it off.  

	Notice that the documentation in .NET is actually incorrect, they
	state that setting ContentLength is mandatory.  It is not.

2003-04-12  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebResponse.cs: fixes bug #41180.

2003-03-25  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: throw an exception is the response code is >= 300.

2003-03-07  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: implemented IDisposable, make the request stream
	read only. Changed the way of disposing the socket.

	* HttpWebResponse.cs: wrapped the socket in a write-only NetworkStream,
	handle chunked transfer encoding (no more hangs), added serialization
	stuff, call CheckDisposed at the beginning of methods/properties (not
	in a finally clause).

2003-02-17  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* WebClient.cs : Implemented Credentials property.

2003-02-04  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* SocketAddress.cs: byte 1 of the data is the high byte of the family,
	not the size.

2003-01-29  Atsushi Enomoto <ginga@kit.hi-ho.ne.jp>

	* WebClient.cs : hacked OpenRead, DownloadData and DownloadFile.

2002-10-24  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWebRequest.cs: applied patch from Tim Haynes
	(thaynes@openlinksw.com).

	Avoided double-sending of the request to the server when both
	GetRequestStream() and GetResponse() are called.
	System Header attributes survive the Headers attribute set.
	Added handling of Connection: KeepAlive/Close

2002-10-03  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>
