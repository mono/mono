	* arch.cs, compiler.cs: Give the interpreter machine a property
	for the retrieval of the group count.

	* regex.cs: Use the new GroupCount property of the factory to
	initialise the current group count, and restructure code to compile
	the pattern only the first time it is needed (essentially backing
	out the previous revision of regex.cs, to use the new code.)

	* regex.cs: Added the ctr for ISerializable implementation and
	implemented the GetObjectData function.

2002-07-30  Juli Mallett  <jmallett@FreeBSD.org>

	* regex.cs: Fixed bug where the expression would not be
	re-evaluated for grouping purposes when factory caches were
	used, resulting in no groups being recognised after one call
	with a given pattern and no change in options.
