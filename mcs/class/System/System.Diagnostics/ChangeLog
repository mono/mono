	* Process.cs: Throw documented exceptions when getting stdin,
	stdout or stderr and they haven't been redirected.  Check that
	CreatePipe didn't fail, throw exceptions if it did.  Close
	redirected streams when the process is disposed, rather than rely
	on the GC disposing them later.  Makes timeline much happier,
	because it could run out of file descriptors between GC
	collections.

2004-09-06  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: Make Dispose() actually dispose things.

2004-06-24  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

2004-05-19  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	true. Also throw if FileName is null.

2004-04-06  Lluis Sanchez Gual  <lluis@ximian.com>

	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs: If initializeData is provided,
	use the constructor that only takes one string as parameter to
	construct the listener. The name is set using the Name property, not the
	constructor.
	
	* TextWriterTraceListener.cs: In Write*, do nothing if no writer was 
	provided.

2004-03-25  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

2004-02-22  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: ExitCode and ExitTime check that the process is finished.

2003-12-10  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: if there's an error when starting the process, the 'pid'
	field contains the GetLastError code. Use that for the Win32Exception.

2003-12-06  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

2003-03-19  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: Implement HasExited, fixes bug 39267

2003-03-13  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: throw an exception when the executable cannot be found.

2002-12-20  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs: 
	  - Don't assume that optional attributes are always present
	  - <assert/> can't have any child nodes
	  - Change in semantics: if the attribute isn't present,
	    GetAttribute() returns null, not "".  This allows us to
	    differentiate between an attribute not being present and an
	    attribute with an empty value.
	  - Translate exceptions if a TraceListener type is invalid

2002-12-19  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* TraceListenerCollection.cs: IndentLevel and IndentSize shouldn't be 
	  hardcoded; they should be set to whatever TraceImpl is using (which
	  in turn may have been set by the .config file, so we should get the
	  user-specified values in added listeners).
	* TraceListener.cs: Make sure that indents are initially written.  This 
	  allows code that uses Trace.Indent() before a Trace.WriteLine() to be 
	  indented properly.
	* TraceImpl.cs: provide a static constructor to explicitly specify the
	  ordering of initialization, in particular the ordering of
	  TraceImpl.Listeners and the reading of the .config file (by
	  accessing DiagnosticsConfiguration.Settings).  This (hopefully)
	  ensures that the Listeners collection is initialized before the
	  .config file is read in, as the DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler will
	  directly modify the listeners collection.
	  The DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler assumes this so that it can
	  <add/> and <remove/> trace listeners and set the logfile for the
	  DefaultTraceListener.


2002-12-18  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* BooleanSwitch.cs: Complete re-write.  It works now.
	* DefaultTraceListener.cs:
	  - Use `const' strings, so I don't worry about copy/paste errors
	  - Give `AssertUiEnabled' an actual backing member
	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs: To avoid race conditions, let the
	  configuration handler set .config-specified properties on
	  DefaultTraceListener (AssertUiEnabled, LogFileName) and TraceImpl
	  (AutoFlush, IndentSize).
	* Switch.cs: Near complete re-write.  Actually works, and is (should be)
	  comformant with .NET behavior.  Changed member names because they
	  were confusing me.  (Yes, that doesn't say much about my memory.)
	* TextWriterTraceListener.cs: Append text to already existing files,
	  don't overwrite them.
	* TraceImpl.cs:
	  - Added private destructor, to ensure no instances are created.
	  - Move members declarations to be closer to each other.
	* TraceSwitch.cs: Complete re-write.  It works now.

2002-12-17  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs: Implement so that .config files
	support <system.diagnostics> sections.

2002-12-15  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: Implemented {get_,set_}{Min,Max}WorkingSet,
	ProcessName, GetProcessById, GetProcesses, GetProcessesByName.
	Pass the working directory to Start.  Pass the program and args in
	one string to be used with the second arg of CreateProcess, so it
	will search the path.

	* TraceImpl.cs: Remove debug prints

2002-09-19  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>
