Tue Jan 23 17:19:13 CET 2007 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* ProcessStartInfo.cs: put the fields in the order expected
	by the runtime code.

2007-01-18  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	previous process handle (bug #80143).

2006-11-27 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: the Process returned by the static Start method never had
	the right ProcessStartInfo. Fixes bug #80019.

2006-10-13  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs : be more skeptic on
	  broken configuration file.

2006-09-28 Andrew Skiba <andrews@mainsoft.com>

	* DefaultTraceListener.cs: TARGET_JVM

2006-09-11 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: fix operation number to be 8. The other one was working
	because the default is to wait for input on the file descriptor.

2006-09-05  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Win32EventLog.cs: Removed workarounds for bug #79152 and bug #79117
	now that these have been fixed. Release unmanaged memory that was
	allocated for replacement strings.

2006-08-27  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NullEventLog.cs: Added dummy GetLogNames implementation.
	* EventLogImpl.cs: Moved GetEventLogs implementation to base class.
	Added abstract GetLogNames method. Added ValidateCustomerLogName

	new log to ensure the significant part of the log name is unique, does
	not match any of the special log names and does not match an exist event
	source.
	* Win32EventLog.cs: Validate customer log name when creating new log.
	Moved GetEventLogs implementation to base class. Added GetLogNames
	method.
	* LocalFileEventLog.cs: Merged CreateLogStore into CreateEventSource.
	Validate customer log name when creating new log. Moved GetEventLogs
	implementation to base class. Added GetLogNames method.

2006-08-26  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Win32EventLog.cs: Fixed error messages. Use RegisterEventSource
	pinvoke when opening eventlog for writing entries.

2006-08-26  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Win32EventLog.cs: Added and documented workarounds for bug #79117
	and bug #79152.

2006-08-25  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* LocalFileEventLog.cs: When event log store does not exist, then we
	do not need to perform a case-insensitive lookup of the log name.

2006-08-20  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* EventLog.cs: Removed namespace import.
	* EventInstance.cs: Added range checks and check whether specified
	entry type is defined.

2006-08-20  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* EventLogEntry.cs: Added InstanceId property (2.0 only). Moved
	Obsolete attribute to correct property.
	* EventSourceCreationData.cs: Updated copyright. For internal ctor,
	set log name to "Application" if value is null or zero-length string.
	* EventLogImpl.cs: EventImpl now acts as base class for event log 
	implemenations.
	* NullEventLog.cs: Modified to implement new abstract methods of base
	class. Removed factory class.
	* EventLog.cs: EventLog implementation that delegates just about 
	everything to individual eventlog providers. To specify the event log
	implementation to use, the MONO_EVENTLOG_TYPE environment variable can
	be used. Possible values are:
	- win32	: read/write entries using the native win32 eventlog
	- local[:path] : read/write entries as files to a local directory
	- null : silently ignore all entries
	The default is "null" on unix (and versions of Windows before NT,
	meaning Windows 98, ...), and "win32" on Windows NT (and higher).
	When "the local" implementation is used, the directory in which to 
	store the event logs, event sources and entries can be specified as 
	part of MONO_EVENTLOG_TYPE environment variable using the syntax 
	"local:<path>" (eg. local:/home/myuser/mono/eventlog).
	* LocalFileEventLog.cs: Event log implementation which uses a local
	file store. The directory to use for persistence can be specified
	as part of the MONO_EVENTLOG_TYPE environment variable (see above).
	If that directory is not explicitly set, then the following directory
	will be used for storing eventlog entries:
	- windows	: %APPDATA%\mono\eventlog
	- unix		: /var/lib/mono/eventlog
	On unix, the directory permission for individual eventlog log 
	directories will be set to 777 (with +t bit) allowing everyone to
	read and write eventlog entries while only allowing entries to be
	deleted by the user(s) that created them.
	Format of log files was modified to allow it contain all necessary
	information for an event log entry.
	* Win32EventLog.cs: Event log implementation for Windows NT and 
	higher which uses the Win32 native event log for reading/writing
	eventlog entries, and which uses the registry to store event log and
	event source registration information.
	* EventLogEntryCollection.cs: Delegate implementation to event log
	implementation. Use lazy init for enumerating entries. Cache current
	item in 2.0 profile.

2006-08-14  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* LocalFileEventLog.cs : change lengthy environment variable name.
	  MONO_LOCAL_EVENTLOG_PATH -> MONO_EVENTLOG_PATH.

2006-08-14  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* EventLogImpl.cs, EventLogEntryCollection.cs, EventLog.cs :
	  some rework to support actual event log implementations.
	* NullEventLog.cs, LocalFileEventLog.cs :
	  new files. The former (default) implementation does nothing for
	  any event log features. The latter implements local file based
	  event logs.

2006-08-14  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* UnixEventLog.cs, EventLogEntry.cs, EventSourceCreationData.cs,
	  EventLogImpl.cs, Win32EventLog.cs, EventLogEntryCollection.cs,
	  EventLog.cs:
	  Reverted previous two changes that does not work at all.

2006-08-11  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* EventLog.cs: For now, Use null implementation.

2006-08-11  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* EventLogEntry.cs: Added InstanceId property (2.0 only). Moved
	Obsolete attribute to correct property.
	* EventSourceCreationData.cs: Updated copyright. For internal ctor,
	set log name to "Application" if value is null or zero-length string.
	* EventLogImpl.cs: EventImpl now acts as base class for event log 
	implemenations. Added NullEventLog implementation, which is not used
	at the moment.
	* EventLog.cs: EventLog implementation that uses registry for
	keeping track of logs and sources to match .NET (and Windows). When
	running on Windows NT (and higher), event entries are written to
	the native win32 event log.  Reading event entries is not yet working
	for Windows. On linux, we use a local file store (based on patch by 
	Atsushi).
	* UnixEventLog.cs: Event log implementation for linux which uses a
	local file store.
	* Win32EventLog.cs: Event log implementation for Windows NT and 
	higher which uses the Win32 native event log.
	* EventLogEntryCollection.cs: Delegate implementation to event log
	implemenation. Use lazy init for enumerating entries.

2006-08-09 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: reset the 'start' time if we wait for stdout reading to
	be completed.

2006-08-09 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: add support for 2.0 asynchronous reads on stdout and
	stderr.

2006-08-09  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* EventSourceCreationData.cs: Marked ctor internal, and removed ctor.
	Throw ArgumentOutOfRangeException if negative value for CategoryCount
	is set.

2006-08-09  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* EventInstance.cs: Added 2.0 class.
	* EventSourceCreationData.cs: Added 2.0 class.
	* OverflowAction.cs: Added 2.0 enum.

2006-07-31  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* EventLogEntry.cs: Add a linkdemand for unrestricted on class.
	* EventLogTraceListener.cs: Add a linkdemand for unrestricted on class
	* FileVersionInfo.cs: Add a linkdemand for unrestricted on class. Add
	an imperative demand for FileIOPermission.Read on GetVersionInfo 
	method. Change ToString method to use a StringBuilder.
	* PerformanceCounterCategory.cs: Add a linkdemand for unrestricted on
	class.
	* PerformanceCounterManager.cs: Add a linkdemand for unrestricted on 
	class. Add [Obsolete] for NET_2_0 profile.
	* Process.cs: Add a linkdemand and an inheritancedemand for 
	unrestricted on class.
	* ProcessStartInfo.cs: Add a linkdemand for unrestricted on class.

2006-07-16  Andrew Skiba <andrews@mainsoft.com>

	* Process.cs: throw FileNotFoundException earlier; give more
	diagnostics.

2006-05-16  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: Dispose the handle from a destructor too

2006-04-04  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Stopwatch.cs:
	  Zoltan was quicker to add it, here I put my implementation ;-)
	* Process.cs :
	  Added some missing long members (not implemented anyways).
	* DataReceivedEventHandler.cs DataReceivedEventArgs.cs :
	  added new 2.0 types.

2006-04-01  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@gmail.com>

	* Stopwatch.cs: New file.

2006-03-31  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@gmail.com>

	* Debug.cs: Add net 2.0 Print methods.

2006-03-03  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: Close redirected pipes on errors.  Fixes bug 77514.

2006-01-12  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* ConsoleTraceListener.cs: New 2.0 class

2005-11-17  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: Split Start_common into Start_shell and
	Start_noshell, which call ShellExecuteEx and CreateProcess
	respectively.  Fixes bug 76670.

2005-09-21 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: deal with the fact that someone can enable raising events
	and/or registed a Exited delegate before and *after* Start is called for
	the process. Only queue the exit callback in the threadpool when it's
	possible and requested. Fixes bug #76129.

2005-08-09  Gert Driesen <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* EventLog.cs: Fixed Designer attribute to match MS.NET.
	* ICollectData.cs: Added marshalling attribute to match MS.NET.

	DesignerSerializationVisibility on StartInfo to match MS.NET, changed
	Category attribute on Exited event to match MS.NET.

2005-06-09  Gert Driesen <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TraceImpl.cs: Adjust internal indentlevel and indentsize before 
	passing on to listeners. Fixes some test failures.

2005-06-07 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* DefaultTraceListener.cs: s/MONO_TRACE/MONO_TRACE_LISTENER/. The
	runtime uses MONO_TRACE too...

2005-05-31  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* PerformanceCounterPermissionEntry.cs: Added more 2.0 validations for
	machine names and PerformanceCounterPermissionAccess.

2005-02-22 Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* TraceImpl.cs: More Thread-safety fixes.  I have to lock on
	  Listeners.SyncRoot as we're traversing the collection and can't let the
	  collection change from underneath us while we're iterating over it
	  (alternately, we could clone the collection and iterate over the clone
	  without having locking issues -- assuming we had a lock-free clone -- 
	  but this would kill the GC).  Fixes 69964.  Only define lock_ if we're 
	  using the lock-free initialization routine; it's not used otherwise.

2005-01-18 Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs (DiagnosticsConfiguration): 
	  Use a lock-free algorithm for creating the settings information.
	* TraceImpl.cs (InitOnce): Use a lock-free algorithm for creating the
	  listeners collection and initializing the world.

2005-01-18 Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs (DiagnosticsConfiguration): Don't 
	  read the .config file from the static ctor (again), as if it fails we'll 
	  get a TypeLoadException -- bad!  Instead, lazy-read the .config file.
	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs (DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler): 
	  Require that the /switch/add/@value attribute contains only numeric values.
	* TraceImpl.cs: Don't initialize everything in the static ctor, as if it
	  fails (due to an invalid .confg file) we get a TypeLoadException, while
	  .NET generates a ConfigurationException.  Instead, initialize everything
	  the first time the Listeners property is accessed, which allows the static
	  ctor to run without chance of failure, avoiding the TypeLoadException.
	* TraceListenerCollection.cs: This should be thread-safe, as it's accessible
	  from a static member of TraceImpl (available through the public Debug and 
	  Trace classes).
	* Switch.cs: Leave the original switch value alone.  If it isn't valid 
	  (i.e. numeric), the DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler will catch it.

2005-01-17 Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs: The /switch/add/@value attribute 
	  isn't optional under .NET 1.1, so make sure it exists.

2005-01-13 Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs: Make DiagnosticsConfiguration.Settings
	  thread-safe (double-checked locking isn't thread safe on .NET without
	  using a volatile variable, and setting the variable in the static
	  constructor is easier anyway).
	* Switch.cs (GetConfigFileSetting): If the setting is non-numeric, set the
	  attribute value to the string "0".  This is apparently what .NET 1.1 does,
	  and allows the SwitchTest NUnit test to work w/o failures.

2004-12-06 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: always pass the same arguments to the runtime.

2004-09-11  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* EventLogPermission.cs: Completed implementation.
	* EventLogPermissionAccess.cs: Fixed enum values.
	* EventLogPermissionEntry.cs: Added validation for machine names.
	* EventLogPermissionEntryCollection.cs: Added synchronization
	of entries with the base permission class.
	* PerformanceCounterPermission.cs: Completed implementation.
	* PerformanceCounterPermissionAccess.cs: Fixed enum values.
	* PerformanceCounterPermissionEntry.cs: Added validations for machine
	and category names.
	* PerformanceCounterPermissionEntryCollection.cs: Added synchronization
	of entries with the base permission class.

2004-09-10  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* EventLogPermission.cs: Fixed initialization (TagNames and
	PermissionAccessType).
	* EventLogPermissionAccess.cs: Added new enums for NET_2_0 and added 
	[Obsolete] to some existing elements.
	* EventLogPermissionAttribute.cs: Added missing validation to property
	MachineName. Fixed changes for NET_2_0.
	* PerformanceCounterPermission.cs: Fixed initialization (TagNames and
	PermissionAccessType).
	* PerformanceCounterPermissionAccess.cs: Added new enums for NET_2_0
	and added [Obsolete] to some existing elements.
	* PerformanceCounterPermissionAttribute.cs: Added missing validations
	to properties (Path, MachineName). Fixed changes for NET_2_0.

2004-09-07  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: Throw documented exceptions when getting stdin,
	stdout or stderr and they haven't been redirected.  Check that
	CreatePipe didn't fail, throw exceptions if it did.  Close
	redirected streams when the process is disposed, rather than rely
	on the GC disposing them later.  Makes timeline much happier,
	because it could run out of file descriptors between GC
	collections.

2004-09-06  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: Make Dispose() actually dispose things.

2004-06-24  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs : quick fix for UseShellExecute=false on windows. See
	  the code comment.

2004-06-17  Lluis Sanchez Gual  <lluis@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: Added missing check in HasExited property.

2004-05-20  Gert Driesen (drieseng@users.sourceforge.net)

	* EventLogPermissionAttribute.cs:
	* PerformanceCounterPermissionAttribute.cs: adjust AllowMultiple
	and Inherited to match .NET

2004-05-19  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: separate the command and the arguments when calling
	Start_internal.

2004-05-19  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: redirecting I/O is not permitted if UseShellExecute is
	true. Also throw if FileName is null.

2004-04-06  Lluis Sanchez Gual  <lluis@ximian.com>

	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs: If initializeData is provided,
	use the constructor that only takes one string as parameter to
	construct the listener. The name is set using the Name property, not the
	constructor.
	
	* TextWriterTraceListener.cs: In Write*, do nothing if no writer was 
	provided.

2004-03-25  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: use the ISynchronizeInvoke object to invoke the event.
	Implemented Close, CloseMainWindow and Kill.

2004-03-23 Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Switch.cs: Don't throw when there is no switches section.

2004-03-22  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: support EnableRaisingEvents + Exited event.

2004-03-15  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: patch by Gert Driesen that fixes WaitForExit when the
	timeout is int.MaxValue.

2004-03-15  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: added environment variables setting support and also
	send useShellExecute to the runtime.

	* ProcessStartInfo.cs: support EnvironmentVariables.  MS uses
	StringDictionary, which turns keys into lowercase. We don't do that.

2004-02-22  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: ExitCode and ExitTime check that the process is finished.

2003-12-10  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: if there's an error when starting the process, the 'pid'
	field contains the GetLastError code. Use that for the Win32Exception.

2003-12-06  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* DefaultTraceListener: Don't use `where' in variable names.

	* Process.cs: Implement HasExited, fixes bug 39267

2003-03-13  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: throw an exception when the executable cannot be found.

2002-12-20  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs: 
	  - Don't assume that optional attributes are always present
	  - <assert/> can't have any child nodes
	  - Change in semantics: if the attribute isn't present,
	    GetAttribute() returns null, not "".  This allows us to
	    differentiate between an attribute not being present and an
	    attribute with an empty value.
	  - Translate exceptions if a TraceListener type is invalid

2002-12-19  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* TraceListenerCollection.cs: IndentLevel and IndentSize shouldn't be 
	  hardcoded; they should be set to whatever TraceImpl is using (which
	  in turn may have been set by the .config file, so we should get the
	  user-specified values in added listeners).
	* TraceListener.cs: Make sure that indents are initially written.  This 
	  allows code that uses Trace.Indent() before a Trace.WriteLine() to be 
	  indented properly.
	* TraceImpl.cs: provide a static constructor to explicitly specify the
	  ordering of initialization, in particular the ordering of
	  TraceImpl.Listeners and the reading of the .config file (by
	  accessing DiagnosticsConfiguration.Settings).  This (hopefully)
	  ensures that the Listeners collection is initialized before the
	  .config file is read in, as the DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler will
	  directly modify the listeners collection.
	  The DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler assumes this so that it can
	  <add/> and <remove/> trace listeners and set the logfile for the
	  DefaultTraceListener.


2002-12-18  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* BooleanSwitch.cs: Complete re-write.  It works now.
	* DefaultTraceListener.cs:
	  - Use `const' strings, so I don't worry about copy/paste errors
	  - Give `AssertUiEnabled' an actual backing member
	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs: To avoid race conditions, let the
	  configuration handler set .config-specified properties on
	  DefaultTraceListener (AssertUiEnabled, LogFileName) and TraceImpl
	  (AutoFlush, IndentSize).
	* Switch.cs: Near complete re-write.  Actually works, and is (should be)
	  comformant with .NET behavior.  Changed member names because they
	  were confusing me.  (Yes, that doesn't say much about my memory.)
	* TextWriterTraceListener.cs: Append text to already existing files,
	  don't overwrite them.
	* TraceImpl.cs:
	  - Added private destructor, to ensure no instances are created.
	  - Move members declarations to be closer to each other.
	* TraceSwitch.cs: Complete re-write.  It works now.

2002-12-17  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* DiagnosticsConfigurationHandler.cs: Implement so that .config files
	support <system.diagnostics> sections.

2002-12-15  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Process.cs: Implemented {get_,set_}{Min,Max}WorkingSet,
	ProcessName, GetProcessById, GetProcesses, GetProcessesByName.
	Pass the working directory to Start.  Pass the program and args in
	one string to be used with the second arg of CreateProcess, so it
	will search the path.
