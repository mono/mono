	* UdpClient.cs: Make Dispose private.

2002-08-20  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Fix deadlock when the AsyncResult callback calls
	End*().  Set the async request's worker property so it can return
	results.  These two fixes combined fix bug 28092.

	* Socket.cs: Make SetSocketOption cope with boolean values (they
	are passed as objects, not the ints the runtime was expecting)

2002-05-17  Lawrence Pit <loz@cable.a2000.nl>
 	* TcpListener.cs: Renamed LocalEndPoint to LocalEndpoint
	* NetworkStream.cs, UdpClient.cs and TcpClient.cs: modified disposable 
	routines, added	checks for disposed state.
	* UdpClient.cs: commented out GetHashCode and Equals as it's not
	overriden in ms.net implementation.

	* TcpClient.cs: fixed SetTcpClient so that
	TcpListener.AcceptTcpClient works and allows
	you to call GetStream() on its result
