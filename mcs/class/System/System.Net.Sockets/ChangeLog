	* NetworkStream.cs: Write should ensure that writes all the contents
	of the buffer. Fixes bug #70123. Besos para Miguelito.

2004-10-14  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs (Sockets ): Set Accept()ed socket blocking status to
	be the same as the listening socket.  This follows MS behaviour.

2004-08-04  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Update Connected state in Select and Poll; this is
	when we find out that non-blocking Connects succeed.  Fixes bug
	62398.

2004-07-28  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: ReceiveFrom might not return a valid EndPoint.  Patch
	by Nick Vaughan (dev@6wardlaw.freeserve.co.uk), fixes bug 61608.

2004-07-15  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Don't try and dereference a null array in Select()
	(possible if a descriptor list of length 0 was passed.)  Patch by
	Nick Vaughan (dev@6wardlaw.freeserve.co.uk), fixes bug 61595.

2004-07-12 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

        * Socket.cs: if'ed RemoveReferences calls.

2004-07-09  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Slight tweak to allow unknown objects to be returned
	by GetSocketOption().

2004-06-28 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: connect on non-blocking sockets returns EINPROGRESS. Fixes
	bug #60811.

2004-06-23 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: wrong error code in connect and accept. EWOULDBLOCK is
	10035. Fixes bug #60563.

2004-06-20  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: fixed Accept for non-blocking sockets.

2004-06-10  Gert Driesen <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* LingerOption.cs: marked field private to fix API signature
	* MulticastOption.cs: marked field private to fix API signature

2004-06-05  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: throw ArgumentNullException if all the list are null OR
	empty. Fixes bug #59632.

2004-05-21  Patrik Torstensson <totte@hiddenpeaks.com>

	* TcpListener.cs: Fixes a lot of the problems with remoting nunit tests.
	
	(AcceptTcpClient): Don't create TcpClient before a
	connection is accepted.
	
	(LocalEndPoint): Use Server LocalEndPoint if connected
	otherwise use endpoint from ctor.
	
	(Init): Save end point, not server endpoint. This did
	cause TcpListener to ignore port sent via constructor.

	(Pending): Fixed wait time (method should return directly)
	
	(Start): Moved Bind here instead of Init method; old method
	caused us to bind ports even if the listener was stopped.
	
	(Stop): Null server when stopping

2004-05-13  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* UdpClient.cs: 
	* TcpClient.cs: Public API fixes

2004-05-07  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: fix for BeginConnect and non-blocking sockets.

2004-05-03  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Use assembly name const to load Mono.Posix.

2004-05-01  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: only enable socket AIO if MONO_ENABLE_SOCKET_AIO is there.
	I will remove this once THE bug is hunted.

2004-04-28  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: added support for unmanaged asynchronous IO. Speed up
	error checking.
	* UdpClient.cs: fixed Dispose so that it only closes the socket when
	called explicitly.

2004-04-24  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: added GetSupportsAsync and Poll_internal internal calls.
	Cleaned up Worker class: moved fields to SocketAsyncResult and use Poll
	when the socket is non-blocking before getting EWOULDBLOCK error.

2004-04-08  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Rearrange the internal calls so that the exceptions
	are thrown from managed code

2004-03-21  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: when Dispose (bool) is called from the finalizer, always
	do the cleanup. Fixes yet another nullref with xsp.

2004-02-19  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: implemented IOControl.

2004-02-18  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: use the threadpool for asynchronous calls instead of
	creating new threads.

2004-02-12  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: added locks around waithandle assign and comparison in
	class Worker. Handle other exceptions than SocketException for
	non-blocking sockets.

2004-01-24  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: handle WSAEWOULDBLOCK for non-blocking sockets. Fixes
	bug #53168. Avoid the creation of the ManualResetEvent in class Worker
	whenever possible.

2004-01-24  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: if we have a pending async event, delay socket closing
	until EndX is called. Fixes bug #53229. Check parameters and if the
	socket has been disposed. Implemented IDisposable explicitly. The
	threads created have IsBackground = true now.

2004-01-10  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: patch from Brad Fitzpatrick <brad@danga.com> episode 2.

2003-12-30  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	throwing.  Patch by Brad Fitzpatrick <brad@danga.com>.

2003-12-18  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	Fixes bug #52329.

2003-10-20  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* TcpClient.cs: Fix void Dispose (bool disposing) to follow the
	pattern.  It was shutting down the managed resources even in the
	finalizer case, it should only do that when called from
	IDisposable.Dipose.

2003-09-11  Lluis Sanchez Gual <lluis@ximian.com>

	* NetworkStream.cs: Added [In,Out] attributes to Read method.

2003-08-24  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* TcpListener.cs: various fixes to make the new tests pass. Closes
	bug #47848.

2003-08-10  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* UdpClient.cs (Receive): Fix Bug 45633;  We should do a blocking
	call until a datagram is arrives from the remote host.  This
	removes the 512 "magic" buffer size when we did not have any data.
 
2003-07-31  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* NetworkStream.cs:
	* Socket.cs: fixed array boundary checks. 0 sized arrays are allowed.

2003-07-18  Andreas Nahr <ClassDevelopment@A-SoftTech.com>

	* Socket.cs: Added GetHashCode method

2003-07-14  Jerome Laban <jlaban@wanadoo.fr>

	* Socket.cs:
	* ProtocolType.cs:
	* SocketOptionLevel.cs:
	* TcpListener.cs:
	* TcpClient.cs:
	* UdpClient.cs:
	
	Added IPv6 support.

	* IPv6MulticastOption.cs: Added for IPv6 support.

2003-05-16  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Use Mono.Posix.UnixEndPoint if its available

2003-05-11  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* MulticastOption.cs: patch by Jerome Laban included in bug #42393.

2003-05-05  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs:
        (Select): don't create arrays if not needed.
        (Poll): call Select_internal directly.

	Warning: you need an up to date runtime for this to work!

2003-03-25  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* UdpClient.cs: don't bind the socket unless .ctor (IPEndPoint) is used.
	Added more checks and throws.
	Small fixes in Send to avoid duplicating the buffer.
	Moved CheckIfDisposed calls to the start of the methods instead of doing
	the check inside a finally clause.

2003-03-03  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs:
	(SendTo): fix from Jerome Laban <jlaban@wanadoo.fr>.

2003-02-28  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: patch from Elan Feingold <efeingold@mn.rr.com>. Fixes
	NullReferenceException when the callback is null.

2003-02-17  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* NetworkStream.cs: allow 0 size array in Write.

2003-02-16  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: make Worker.Connect and Receive work with non-blocking
	sockets. May be Receive* and Send* in Worker need to do the same. I'll
	wait for bug reports. Set IsCompleted to true before invoking the end
	callback. Fixes bug #38136.

2003-01-23  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* NetworkStream.cs: the check for disposed should not be done in the
	finally clause.

2003-01-04  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* UdpClient.cs: fixed bug #36226.

2002-11-13  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Only close the socket in one place, ie the Dispose
	method.  Fixes bug 32054.

2002-11-09  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: offset == size == 0 it's ok in Send ().

2002-11-03  Phillip Pearson  <pp@myelin.co.nz>

	* TcpClient.cs: Fixed SetTcpClient() to pass through to the Client 
	property, which now sets stream to null (it's set by GetStream()).  This 
	should make GetStream() work on a TcpClient which has had the socket set 
	by assignment to the Client property, not only one that has been created 
	by TcpListener.AcceptTcpClient().

2002-10-08  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: 
	* NetworkStream.cs: Bounds checking fixes, and better exception
	texts.  Changes by timothyjmills@hotmail.com (Timothy J. Mills).

2002-10-03  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* TcpClient.cs: NoDelay is a TCP option, not Socket

2002-09-16  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* SocketFlags.cs: Add missing enumeration.

	* UdpClient.cs: Make Dispose private.

2002-08-20  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Fix deadlock when the AsyncResult callback calls
	End*().  Set the async request's worker property so it can return
	results.  These two fixes combined fix bug 28092.

2002-06-24  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs: Make SetSocketOption cope with boolean values (they
	are passed as objects, not the ints the runtime was expecting)

2002-05-17  Lawrence Pit <loz@cable.a2000.nl>
 	* TcpListener.cs: Renamed LocalEndPoint to LocalEndpoint
	* NetworkStream.cs, UdpClient.cs and TcpClient.cs: modified disposable 
	routines, added	checks for disposed state.
	* UdpClient.cs: commented out GetHashCode and Equals as it's not
	overriden in ms.net implementation.

2002-05-17  Jaroslaw Kowalski <jarek@atm.com.pl>
	* TcpClient.cs: fixed SetTcpClient so that
	TcpListener.AcceptTcpClient works and allows
	you to call GetStream() on its result

2002-04-24  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* Socket.cs (Poll): Give correct argument to Select(), as spotted
	by Jaroslaw Kowalski <jarek@atm.com.pl>

2002-04-16  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* UdpClient.cs: implemented.

2002-04-02  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* TcpListener.cs: in Start(), set the socket listen backlog value
	to a sane value (noticed by Jonathan Stowe <gellyfish@gellyfish.com>)
