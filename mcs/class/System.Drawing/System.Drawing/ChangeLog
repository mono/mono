2010-07-16  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Graphics.cs (CopyFromScreen): Avoid crash if asked for a region
	to big for XGetImage to return. Fix bug #582823

2010-03-01  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Point.cs: Fix #554635, our constructor that takes an int had the
	values for X and Y swapped out.

2009-10-13 Marek Safar  <marek.safar@gmail.com>

	* KnownColors.cs: FindColorMatch has to match only predefined color
	names ignoring system elements.

	* ColorTranslator.cs: Add more predefined names.

2009-07-15 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* Font.cs: implement OriginalFontName.

2009-07-15  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Fix XVisualIDFromVisual to return an IntPtr
	since 64 bits X servers will return a 64 bits value.
	* gdipStructs.cs: Fix XVisualInfo to use IntPtr on fields that
	are 64 bits on 64 bits X servers.
	* Graphics.cs: Adjust CopyFromScreenX11 to work with IntPtr so the
	screenshot code can work on both 32 and 64 bits X servers.
	[Fix bug #521718]

2008-11-24  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Ensure that System.Drawing works on the mac as 
	well as unix.

2008-11-21  Andreia Gaita  <shana@jitted.com>

	* Image.cs: On win32, when cloning images initialized from
	resources, also clone the underlying stream, since it needs to stay
	around for the life of the image (gdi doesn't clone the underlying
	stream when cloning images, so when the gc disposes the original, it
	will also dispose the stream, which invalidates the clone).

	* Bitmap.cs: Save the underlying stream when creating bitmaps from a
	clone under win32
	[fixes #438886]

2008-11-01  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Font.cs: Add comment on .ctor(Font,FontStyle) about the lack of
	null check (compatibility). Add proper (yet compatible ;-) null check
	to GetHeight(Graphics)

2008-10-06  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* Color.cs: Fix Color serialization by changing 'value' visibility
	to private and make everyone access it thru an internal property. 
	This also simplify the A, R, G and B properties and probably covers 
	a few other cases where a similar hack would have been required.
	[Fix bug #410693]
	* KnownColors.cs: Assign Color.Value property and not the value field.
	* RectangleF.cs: Fix edge intersection. Path by Brian Browning.
	[Fix bug #431587]

2008-08-08  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Icon.cs (InitFromStreamWithSize): Use temp ArrayList for IconDirEntry
	to avoid empty slots in array. Use actual index of IconDirEntry in
	array when entries have been skipped. Fixes bug #415581.

2008-08-06  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Icon.cs (InitFromStreamWithSize): Move init of iconDir.idCount
	and imageData until after the number of entries was determined to
	cope with skipping of 256x256 icons. Fixes bug #410608.

2008-07-14  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Fix signature for 
	GdipGetImageAttributesAdjustedPalette
	[Part of fix for bug #402172]

2008-07-07  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Bitmap.cs: Fix exceptions for some ctors.
	* Image.cs: Throw ArgumentNullException for null streams.
	[Fix bug #406763]

2008-07-03  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Image.cs: throw NotImplementedException in SetPropertyItem
	instead of executing broken code. See #406307 for test case.

2008-06-27  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* SizeConverter.cs: Fallback to CultureInfo.CurrentCulture 
	if supplied culture is null.
	* PointConverter.cs: Fallback to CultureInfo.CurrentCulture 
	if supplied culture is null.

2008-05-19  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CharacterRange.cs,
	* ColorConverter.cs,
	* PointConverter.cs,
	* RectangleConverter.cs,
	* SizeConverter.cs,
	* SizeFConverter.cs: Avoid unboxing structs more than one time.
	[Found using Gendarme]

2008-05-18  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Font.cs: Add comment that downcasting the IntPtr is not an 
	issue in this case (offset) since the next API requires it.
	* Icon.cs: Use String.IsNullOrEmpty inside 2.0 code.
	[Found using Gendarme]

2008-05-14  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Graphics.cs: Throw a NotSupportedException if we're ask to create
	a Graphics from a handle and X is not available (i.e. XOpenDisplay 
	returns NULL). Easier to diagnose than a SIGSEGV

2008-03-28  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* IconConverter.cs: Convert null to "(none)".

2008-03-26  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@gmail.com>

	* ComIStreamWrapper.cs: Seek: remove read-only case. CopyTo: avoid allocating
	large buffer. Commit: call SetSizeToPosition.

2008-03-22  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Graphics.cs: Fix typo in exception and provide a bit more details.

2008-03-21  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* carbonFunctions.cs: Disable QDContext caching for now.  It's
	causing crashes in the finalizer code.

2008-03-06  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* ImageFormatConverter.cs: 
	 - String comparison should use the InvariantCulture.
	 - ConvertTo string should return the name for known image formats.
	 [Fixes bug #366570]

2008-03-04  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Graphics.cs: Fix CopyFromScreen for X11 when source or destination
	coordinates are not 0. Fix bug #363881.

2008-03-03  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* ImageFormatConverter.cs: Perform a case insensitive comparison 
	instead of a case sensitive one.
	[Fixes bug #366567]

2008-03-03  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Icon.cs: Don't require icon entries when creating a new icon 
	(since they won't exist if we create the icon from an handle).
	Also avoid a step when cloning. Fix bug #366485

2008-02-10  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Seal GdiPlusStreamHelper class. Found using
	Gendarme.
	* carbonFunctions.cs: Seal Carbon class before 2.0, make it static
	from 2.0. Issues reported by Gendarme.
	* ColorConverter.cs: Seal internal IComparer class CompareColors. 
	Found using Gendarme.
	* FontConverter.cs: Don't ignore result of String.Trim. Found
	using Gendarme.

	of the API but unused) and remove unused internal code. Both found
	using Gendarme.
	* SRDescriptionAttribute.cs: Seal internal attribute. Found using
	Gendarme.

2008-02-01  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* carbonFunction.cs: More clipping fixes.  Include a variable to 
	help debug future clipping problems by showing us the clipped mask.

2008-02-01  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* carbonFunctions.cs: Ensure we save/restore the GState before
	modifying the clipping path as QD contexts can be reused.

2008-02-01  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* carbonFunction.cs:  Rework the clipping interaction with 
	CoreGraphics.  Our old method was buggy in certain cases causing
	improper / inefficient clip handling.

2008-01-23  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* carbonFunction.cs:  Remove some debug code.  Thanks spouliot.

2008-01-23  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* carbonFunctions.cs: Dont crash when we have an orphaned handle.

2008-01-23  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* carbonFunctions.cs: If we get a -ve size from carbon, swizzle to 
	0 to prevent a OOM from cairo malloc.  Remove support for
	GetCGContextForNSView as its deprecated and doesn't work.
	* gdipFunctions.cs: Refactor the environment variable support out
	and make the Carbon driver the default on a Mac.  Fix RunningOnUnix
	to report true on the mac.
	* Graphics.cs: Drop support for CocoaDrawable.

2008-01-21  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* Graphics.cs: Support Graphics.FromHwnd (IntPtr.Zero) on X11
	* carbonFunctions.cs: Support for Graphics.FromHwnd (IntPtr.Zero)
	on Carbon
	* gdipFunctions.cs: Add XDefaultScreen overload.

2008-01-13  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* gdipEnums.cs: Remove Unit enum since there's a public version
	(GraphicsUnit) for it.
	* gdipFunctions.cs: Make GDIPlus class static for 2.0 and remove
	new lines (both warnings from Gendarme). Stop using Unit enum.
	* Pen.cs: Stop using Unit enum.

2008-01-08  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Font.cs: Fix GetHashCode to use the same values as Equals. Fix 
	bug #351647

2007-12-19  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Graphics.cs: Fix Point/PointF typo in FromUnManagedMemoryToPoint.
	Added a few space to make it easier to read those methods. Fix #349800

2007-12-16  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Image.cs: Use the existing GdipPropertyItem.MarshalTo method to
	conver the PropertyItem into a property item with Sequential
	attached to it, and pass that to unmanaged code.   Fixes #349103.

2007-12-11  Vladimir Krasnov  <vladimirk@mainsoft.com>

	* Bitmap.jvm.cs: ArgumentException on unknown format from stream

2007-12-07  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* Graphics.cs: Ensure that we Flush and Synchornize our CGContexts
	before disposing.  Fixes drawing bugs when drawn out of the event
	loop and the caller doesn't Flush.
	* carbonFunctions.cs: Rework the cross-assembly data marshalling to
	use a delegate as suggested by lupus.

2007-11-19  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* ImageAnimator.cs: Check for FrameDimension.Time availability before
	asking the frame count (since MS GDI+ prefers to return an error than
	saying it has a single frame). Fix bug #342733

2007-11-15  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Reflect the renamed environment variable in the new Carbon driver.
	* Graphics.cs: Remove support for the deprecated Cocoa driver until its fixed.

2007-11-12  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* ColorTranslator.cs: Special case handling for LightGray versus 
	HTML's LightGrey. Fix bug #340917.

2007-11-07  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* carbonFunctions.cs: 
	* Graphics.cs: Use QDBeginCGContext / QDEndCGContext to leverage OS caching
	of CGContexts when possible.  If we are still using the context returned by
	QDBeginCGContext, then create a new CGContext for this graphics object.

2007-11-07  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* carbonFunctions.cs: 
	* Graphics.cs: QDBeginCGContext does not support nested calls.
	We need to ref count our context but this will have clipping/CTM collisions
	Support old-style context creation as well.

2007-11-07  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* carbonFunctions.cs: Code cleanup and refactor to use 
	QDBeginCGContext/QDEndCGContext
	* Graphics.cs: Refactor to use QDBeginCGContext/QDEndCGContext
	rather than the deprecated CreateCGContextForPort.  This has the added
	benefit of the QD system caching CGContexts for us as well.

2007-11-07  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* carbonFunctions.cs: Add CFRelease prototype.
	* Graphics.cs: When we're disposing the graphics context clean up the
	CGContext that we've created for it.

2007-11-06  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Bitmap.cs: Add a private, parameter-less, ctor for Bitmap so XML
	serialization is possible under 2.0 (fix for #323246).

2007-11-05  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Add a bool parameter to GdiPlusStreamHelper ctor
	to move, or not, the stream position to load/save images.
	* Image.cs: Stream position is moved to 0 when loading images from 
	stream but isn't moved for saving an image to a stream. Fix part of
	#338779 (except that Image.FromFile behave differently for metafiles)

2007-11-05  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Stream position shouldn't be changed when 
	loading images (bug #338779).
	* Pen.cs: Add a [MonoLimitation] to Pen's Alignment property so that
	the next version of MoMA will report it as not-implemented in 
	libgdiplus (but it works under Windows, i.e. MS GDI+). #338985

2007-11-01  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* carbonFunctions.cs:  Initiali implementation of clipping Z-order masking
	siblings from the context

2007-10-31  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* ImageAnimator.cs: Fix delay == 0 to match most browser (imaginative)
	definitions of "0". Don't throw on null images. Synchronize hashtable.
	Remove unrequired loops.

2007-10-17  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* Graphics.cs: Only synchronize the display on Flush when we actually have
	a CGContext

2007-10-17  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* carbonFunctions.cs: Initial support for clipping children out of the
	CGContext before drawing on it.

2007-10-09  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* carbonFunctions.cs: Correct the P/Invoke definition for CGContext*CTM.

2007-09-26  Ivan N.Zlatev <contact@i-nz.net>

	* ColorConverter.cs: During conversion to InstanceDescriptor check
	both IsSystemColor to get a PropertyInfo from type SystemColors 
	and IsKnownColor to get PropertyInfo from type Color.

2007-08-09  Vladimir Krasnov  <vladimirk@mainsoft.com>

	* ColorTranslator.cs: optimized Html color formatting in ToHtml method

2007-08-13  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Change GdipMeasureString definition to use unsafe
	pointers. 
	* Graphics.cs: Rework MeasureString not to supply integers (characters
	and lines) as they aren't required for most of it's overloads and 
	requires extra code/time to calculate inside libgdiplus. Also fix a 
	possible NRE in MultiplyTransform.

2007-08-01  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Added definition for GdipCloneFontFamily

2007-08-01  Vladimir Krasnov  <vladimirk@mainsoft.com>

	* Graphics.jvm.cs
	* Pen.jvm.cs
	* Region.jvm.cs: Changed MemberwiseClone to clone.
 
2007-05-21  Adar Wesley <adarw@mainsoft.com>

	DrawImageUnscaledAndClipped.

2007-05-18  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Icon.cs: Always open icon files as read only. Fix #81669.

2007-05-15  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Graphics.cs: Fix DrawImageUnscaled for empty (width or height <= 0)
	Fix NRE in DrawImageUnscaledAndClipped. Remove lines with only tabs in
	them.
	* RectangleF.cs: A rectangle with a negative width or height is also
	empty.

2007-05-09 Igor Zelmanovich <igorz@mainsoft.com>

	* FontConverter.cs: for TARGET_JVM destructor is not used.

2007-05-03 Igor Zelmanovich <igorz@mainsoft.com>

2007-05-02  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* gdipEnums.cs: Add GetSysColorIndex
	* gdipStructs.cs: Remove GetSysColorIndex (it's an enum)
	* KnownColors.cs: Fix Windows desktop colors as GetSysColor returns
	values in BGR (not RGB).

2007-05-01  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* KnownColors.cs: Force alpha values (opaque) on Win32's GetSysColor.

2007-04-30  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Color.cs: Reflection didn't like the change from int to uint (thanks
	to Gert for noticing again :-).

2007-04-29  Konstantin Triger  <kostat@mainsoft.com>

	* Color.cs: FromName - do not throw on unknown color.

2007-04-26  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Color.cs: Try to avoid calling GetName in GetHashCode when the color
	isn't named. Commented code (#81465) to remove the string name member 
	for the 2.0 profile (to avoid a reference in a struct).
	* ColorConverter.cs: Use the new KnownColor static uint array.
	* ColorTranslator.cs: Share code between From[Win32|Ole] (both BGR).
	Reduce ToHtml switch size (when html name == known color name).
	* KnownColors.cs: Remove the array of struct for every known colors.
	Add an array of uint with color values and a method to return the name
	of a known color. Big reduction of the static ctor code size.

2007-04-26  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Add p/invoke definitions for GdipRecordMetafile
	FromDelegate[I]_linux.

2007-04-26  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Add p/invoke definitions for GdipRecordMetafile
	[FileName|FromStream][I].

2007-04-16  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Bitmap.cs: Add check in SetPixel for Format16bppGrayScale (but 
	without requiring a second unmanaged call on each SetPixel call).

2007-04-13  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Brush.cs: Ensure we're zeroing the handle before calling 
	CheckStatus. Some clean up.
	* Pen.cs: Ensure we're zeroing the handle before calling CheckStatus.
	Use Locale.GetText for exceptions.

2007-04-11  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Bitmap.cs: Move LockBits validations into unmanaged code.
	* gdipFunctions.cs: Add mapping for Win32Error in CheckStatus. Add
	globalization support for CheckStatus and add the GDI+ status code in
	the error message.
	* SolidBrush.cs: Clean up and add comments about [un]named colors.

2007-04-09  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Color.cs: Remove duplicate check in == and add better comments

2007-04-09  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* Color.cs: Remove hashtables and locks. All color properties are read
	from KnownColors. Remove extra & 0xFF (typecast to byte is enough).
	Keep track of the Name property once calculated. When possible (most
	likely case) don't create the names (strings) in Equals, == and !=
	* ColorTranslator.cs: Use the new KnownColors instead of the separate
	NamedColors and SystemColors.
	* ColorConverter.cs: Use the new KnownColors instead of the separate
	NamedColors and SystemColors.
	* gdipFunctions.cs: Moved GetSysColor p/invoke signature here as this
	class is marked by [SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurity].
	* gdipStructs.cs: Moved Windows-specific GetSysColorIndex enum here.
	* KnownColors.cs: New. Single source for all colors.
	* SystemColors.cs: Vastly simplified. All color properties are read
	from KnownColors.

2007-04-05  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Remove unused (and not part of GDI+) GdipGetHfont
	method.

2007-04-02  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Pen.cs: Simplify. Caching the brush still involved too many 
	unmanaged calls and was hiding libgdiplus bugs (e.g. 81266). Color is
	still cached (a little less ;-) but needs to stay that way so we keep
	the color names available (it's the expected behavior).

2007-03-20  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Graphics.cs: Replace TODO on all EnumerateMetafile overloads.

2007-03-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	where the requested style is not available.  [Fixes #81194]

2007-03-15  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* ColorConverter.cs: Rewrite the hex color convertion to be more 
	compatible with MS implementation (fixing NotWorking unit tests) and
	more endian friendly.

2007-02-28  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Font.cs: Remove internal SysFontName setter property and add a new
	ctor to replace it.
	* SystemFonts.cs: We can't cache font instance (because anyone can
	dispose them) so we must return new instances each time.

2007-02-27  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Bitmap.cs: Removed unrequired ctors.
	* TextureBrush.cs: Change which GDI+ calls is used to create the 
	brush (to better match what you expect from libgdiplus source). Add
	[MonoLimitation] to ctors accepting ImageAttributes (not supported
	by libgdiplus). Split some long lines into two lines.

2007-02-26  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Add p/invoke signature for GDI DeleteObject.
	* Region.cs: Under Windows use DeleteObject when calling ReleaseHrgn.
	Fix bug #80956.

2007-02-21  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Image.cs: Fix Metefile.ctor usage (to avoid creating, and leaking,
	an unmanaged metafile object);

2007-02-16  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Fix some p/invoke definitions (int versus uint) 
	and add more for metafile functions.
	* Image.cs: Fix usage of corrected p/invoke signatures.

2007-02-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* SystemColors.cs: Query Windows for the colors added to this class
	for 2.0.  (Windows-only path of course.)

2007-02-13  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Icon.cs: Ignore Vista 256x256 icons, just like MS does.

2007-02-09  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Icon.cs: Resurrected some old Icon to Bitmap code from SVN history
	to handle convertion for Win32, where MS GDI+ ICO codec doesn't 
	support all the icon formats supported by the Icon class.

2007-02-08  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Bitmap.cs: Adapt code wrt Image changes. Reuse the serialization 
	ctor from Image to avoid duplicate code.
	* gdipEnums.cs: Added ImageType. Clean up extra stuff.
	* gdipFunctions.cs: Added GdipGetImageType and some metafile 
	definitions.
	* Image.cs: Refactor code not to create a Bitmap for every images
	(e.g. FromFile, FromStream) as the result can also be a Metafile.

2007-01-30  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Image.cs: Fix serialization of Image/Bitmap that contains ICO. In 
	this case the image is serialized as a PNG bitmap (note: the ICO codec
	is a decoder-only codec).

2007-01-19  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* Graphics.cs: Fix FromImage to check for indexed images inside
	managed code (and not GDI+ which will report the wrong error code
	for the exception we expect).
	* Image.cs: Remove unused private method IsIndexedPixelFormat.

2007-01-19  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Font.cs: Fix calls to GDIPlus.ReleaseDC (missing parameter). This
	fix the GDI object leaks under Win32 (#80552).
	* gdipFunctions.cs: Fix ReleaseDC signature (missing hWnd).
	* Graphics.cs: Fix ReleaseDC signature (missing hWnd) in NET_2_0.

2007-01-19  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Font.cs: Under Win32 cache the LOGFONT we use to create the HFONT
	handle. This "hides" the fact that ToLogFont leaks (#80552).

2007-01-17  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Added Win32 CreateIconIndirect and DestoryIcon
	imports. Both are required under Win32 to get HICON stuff working.
	Added some GDI+ Metafile related definitions too.
	* gdipStructs.cs: Update IconInfo structure so it can be used when
	calling CreateIconIndirect on Win32.
	* Icon.cs: Add support for handles under Win32.

2007-01-16  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* Icon.cs: Implement saving an icon from it's bitmap representation.
	This allows roundtripped icons (Handle or HICON) to be saved.

2007-01-15  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Icon.cs: Refactor Save code to allow saving a single icon size.
	This allows ToBitmap to produce the right (sized) bitmap wrt the
	selected icon size. Fix #80509 under UNIX.

2007-01-15  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* Bitmap.cs: Make sure we're not building bitmaps using stream that
	can be disposed (as GDI+ may require access to them anytime);
	* Icon.cs: Change icon selection to match either width *or* height.
	* Image.cs: Track user versus internal streams in InitFromStream

2007-01-12  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Graphics.cs: Change DrawIcon* methods to use the internal bitmap
	we keep for the Icon. This is required to let HICON support work with 
	libgdiplus (and should be faster than creating a new bitmap each time)
	* Icon.cs: Fix ctor exceptions. Select the correct icon when multiple
	size are available (and do not match the requested size). Fix handle
	support for work under UNIX (Win32 support still missing). Keep an
	internal bitmap for the Icon to use for HICON support.

2007-01-11  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Icon.cs: Fix .ctor(string) to load, when available, the 32x32 icon.
	Remove TARGET_JVM from file (Mainsoft now use Icon2.jvm.cs). Use GDI+
	to implement ToBitmap method (previous results were wrong).

2007-01-10  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Image.cs: Fix Palette to call into GDI+ even for non-indexed images.
	This case can occurs with the ICOn codec where the returned image is a
	32bpp ARGB bitmap *with* a palette.

2007-01-09  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Font.cs: Unify platform detection code.
	* gdipFunctions.cs: Unify platform detection code.
	* Graphics.cs: Unify platform detection code.
	* Image.cs: Unify platform detection code.
	* SystemColors.cs: Unify platform detection code.

2007-01-08  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* gdipStructs.cs: Add support for SignaturePatterns and 
	SiggnatureMasks values.

2006-12-30  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Don't create "millions" of byte arrays in
	GdiPlusStreamHelper. Just create a default size array and resize it
	only when needed. (as an example: the FileDialog sample created more
	than 1700 new byte arrays on my system before the patch, now only 74)

2006-12-29  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Brush.cs: Fixed line endings.
	* BufferedGraphicsContext.cs: Fixed line endings.
	* CharacterRange.cs: Fixed line endings.
	* Graphics.cs: Fixed line endings.
	* IDeviceContext.cs: Fixed line endings.
	* SizeFConverter.cs: Fixed line endings.
	* SystemBrushes.cs: Fixed line endings.
	* SystemFonts.cs: Fixed line endings.
	* SystemPens.cs: Fixed line endings.

2006-12-22  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Graphics.cs: Splitted CopyFromScreen into platform specific methods
	and added MonoLimitations to all overloads. This should get better 
	results from MoMA.

2006-12-19  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* FontFamily.cs: More accurate Mono* attributes to avoid confusion.
	* Icon.cs: Dummy implementation of ExtractAssociatedIcon to always 
	return SystemIcons.WinLogo (which is better than throwing an NIE).
	Updated MonoTODO, to a MonoLimitation, to reflect the change.

2006-12-14  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Image.cs: Rework Clone so it doesn't confuse MoMA to report a NIE.
	Cloning works for bitmap. Metafiles aren't (actually) supported.

2006-12-07  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Icon.cs: Revert a change from r68882. The type is also part of the 
	icon's name. Fix bug #80181.

2006-12-03  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Icon.cs: Add a new ctor that returns undisposable Icon instances 
	(required when used from SystemIcons). Added a dispose check in 
	ToBitmap (many other are missing).
	* SystemIcons.cs: Change icons to the one already in SVN.

2006-12-02  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* FontConverter.cs: Add a comment why the empty finalizer is required.
	* gdipFunctions.cs: Remove warning from build (unused variable).
	* Icon.cs: Fix .ctor accepting a type - the type is to find the 
	assembly, not the type of the ressource.
	* SystemIcons.cs: Load some icons from the assembly (all the same Mono
	icon for tonight).

2006-11-22  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* BufferedGraphicsContext.cs: Better MonoTODO.
	* BufferedGraphics.cs: Better MonoTODO.
	* Font.cs: Better MonoTODO.
	* FontFamily.cs: Better MonoTODO.
	* Graphics.cs: Better MonoTODO.
	* Icon.cs: Better MonoTODO.
	* Image.cs: Second chance while saving using the current RawFormat.
	This allows icons to be saved as PNG (strange but look at unit tests).
	* ImageFormatConverter.cs: Implement GetStandardValues (and remove
	it's MonoTODO) and fix GetStandardValuesSupported (to return true).
	* Region.cs: Implement ReleaseHrgn (2.0) - not really useful (as the
	handle is never exposed) but it's easier than to document the TODO ;-)
	* SystemIcons.cs: Better MonoTODO.

2006-11-06  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* RectangleF.cs: Fix operator !=. Patch by Manuel Alejandro Cerón 
	Estrada.

2006-11-04  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* SystemColors.cs: reassign the given color to the return value of
	UpdateKnownColor.  This makes sure that the color has the same
	SystemColor name.  So, SystemColors.Control.Name always equals
	"Control", regardless of the values the theme has stuffed in it.

	* Color.cs: UpdateKnownColor now returns the new color.

2006-10-11  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Graphics.cs: In MeasureCharacterRanges throw an ArgumentException if
	StringFormat is null and return an empty region array if no range exists 
	(avoid GDI+ error/exeception). In MeasureString (2 overloads) replace 
	999999 by Int32.MaxValue (now that the real bug is fixed).
	* StringFormat.cs: Ensure we are clearing the handle before throwing
	any exception.

2006-09-21  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Throw an OverflowException for the ValueOverflow
	Status code.

2006-09-21 Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs, Image.cs: 78315. Probably in the future we should
	add the same checking for other resource release GDI API calls.
	
2006-09-19  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* StringFormat.cs: Add missing validations.

2006-09-18  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* Graphics.cs: Add missing validations to MeasureCharacterRanges.

2006-09-18  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Graphics.cs: Reorder instructions in MeasureString methods to avoid
	allocations before checking for quick exit case (null/String.Empty 
	text or throwing execptions).

2006-09-11  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* ImageConverter.cs: Fixed ConvertTo to deal with null values (#79331)
	and not to "return new NotSupportedException", throwing them is better

2006-09-07  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@gmail.com>

	* ComIStreamMarshaler.cs: ManagedToNativeWrapper: Dispose COM vtable
	  on shutdown. Dispose unmanaged resources when constructor fails.

2006-09-06  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@gmail.com>

	* ComIStreamMarshaler.cs: ManagedToNativeWrapper should not have a
	  destructor because it is freed using Release. (Proper fix for bug
	  #78315.) Free COM vtable when unloading and all objects Released.

2006-09-06  Jonathan Chambers  <joncham@gmail.com> 

	* ComIStreamMarshaler.cs: Only deallocate memory
	for COM wrapper if not shutting down. #78315
	
2006-09-04  Jonathan Chambers  <joncham@gmail.com> 

	* ComIStreamMarshaler.cs: Do not deallocate unmanaged memory
	allocated for vtable. If this finalizer runs before all clients
	are done with it (Image(s) in this case) we crash on windows. #78315
	
2006-09-01  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Bitmap.cs: Fix exceptions for LockBits.

2006-08-28  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* ImageAnimator.cs: Remove catch/throw in WorkerThread (it hides the
	original exception). Found with Gendarme.
	* Color.cs: Remove the double-check lock. Found with Gendarme.
	* ColorConverter.cs: Remove the double-check lock. Found with Gendarme

2006-08-28  Jonathan Chambers  <joncham@gmail.com> 

	* ComIStreamMarshaler.cs: Do not free memory allocated for
	Com Callable Wrapper for stream. When Image created from stream
	is destroyed, it calls Release on CCW interface. Somehow we seem
	to be destroying Stream CCW before Image is destroyed. Fixes
	crash on exit on Windows. #78315
	
2006-08-28	Boris Kirzner	<borisk@mainsoft.com>

	* SystemColors.jvm.cs: fix array size for NET_2_0

2006-08-27  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* ColorConverter.cs: Catch the case where the integer part of the 
	color doesn't fit into a 32bit integer.
	* ColorTranslator.cs: Fixed Gendarme's UseStringEmptyRule on ToHtml 
	method. Fixed string handling on FromHtml method. Fixed all parameter
	names to match FX.

2006-08-25  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Change ColorMatrix to IntPtr in method 
	GdipSetImageAttributesColorMatrix definition.
	* FontConverter.cs: Fix compiler warnings.

2006-08-24  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* TextureBrush.cs: Remove private Image member as we cannot, without
	cloning it (which removes the advantage of caching it), return it for 
	the Image property *and* we cannot dispose of it properly (Dispose 
	isn't overridden).

2006-08-22  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Fix GdipGetImageWidth to use an uint for it's
	width out parameter.
	* Image.cs: Cast the uint into an int for the Width property.

2006-08-12  Duncan Mak  <duncan@novell.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs (GdipLoadImageFromStream):
	(GdipSaveImageToStream): Don't include these methods when
	compiling the unit tests.

2006-08-11 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: return -1 when stream.Length throws.

2006-08-11  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* Font.cs: Remove the, now unrequired, FaceNameOffset field and
	use the object size instead of the structure size when copying.

2006-08-11  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Font.cs: Added more checks to ToLogFont and fixed it's behaviour
	to match MS boundary between GDI+ and SD.

2006-08-07  Andrew Skiba <andrews@mainsoft.com>

	* Graphics.jvm.cs, Pen.jvm.cs, Region.jvm.cs: TARGET_JVM fix

2006-08-05  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Font.cs: Avoid double cast in Equals. Return lfCharSet as 1 in
	ToLogFont even if GDI+ has that value to 0.

2006-08-04 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Icon.cs: when converting to Bitmap, handle the 24 bits separately.
	Read the XOR and AND masks in a single read.

2006-08-04  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Pen.cs: Fix unit tests wrt libgdiplus return value change.

2006-08-03  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* FontFamily.cs: Fix unit tests wrt libgdiplus return value change.
	* Region.cs: Fix unit tests wrt libgdiplus return value change.

2006-08-01  Jonathan Chambers  <joncham@gmail.com>

	* Font.cs: Fix marshalling of LOGFONT in ToHfont. 
	Fixes #78939.
	
2006-07-20  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Graphics: Added implementation for ReleaseHDC by Jonathan Pobst 
	for NET_2_0 profile.

2006-07-06  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Image.cs: Ensure we're setting the nativeObject to NULL before 
	throwing any exception while disposing (and avoid possible double
	freeing). Avoid multiple casts in Clone method.
	* Pen.cs: Ensure the internal pen's brush is always disposed 
	correctly. Avoid making a reference to the internal brush.
	* SolidBrush.cs: Avoid setting color when cloning the solid brush
	as the .ctor(IntPtr) always does this job.

2006-07-04  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Image.cs: Made GetThumbnailImage throw OutOfMemoryException when
	image size is invalid (to match MS behaviour), also ensure that the
	Graphics instance is disposed even if CheckStatus throws an exception.

2006-06-26  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Pen.cs: Ensure we dispose of an existing brush before replacing it.
	Avoid double-cast when dealing with SolidBrush.

2006-06-06  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Fix API signature (missing pen pointer) for 
	GdipIsOutlineVisiblePathPoint[I] methods.
	* FontFamily.cs: Delay the call to refreshName until it is actually
	required.

2006-06-02 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Color.cs: when deserializing from an MS generated stream, the value
	for known colors was 0. These changes make our Color handle that case.
	We won't serialize the name for known colors either, but the value will
	be there, so we only check for a 0 value on a known color once.
	Fixes bug #78265.

2006-05-30  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* Font.cs: Change default charset to 1. Ensure we always call the
	CheckStatus method after calling GDI+. Added null checks to match MS
	exception handling.
	* FontFamily.cs: Avoid double-cast in Equals. Fixed Equals not compare
	pointers but names. Simplify the Generic* static properties by reusing
	the .ctor code. Fixed ToString to match MS output. Removed 
	GetStyleCheck as it failed when multiple styles were provided (flags).
	* gdipFunctions.cs: Convert Status.FontFamilyNotFound to an 
	ArgumentException.

2006-05-29  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* ImageFormatConverter.cs: Changed ConvertFrom to work with both short
	(e.g. Bmp) and long (e.g. guid) names.

2006-05-26  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* ImageFormatConverter.cs: Fixing unit tests for ImageFormat 
	introduced a regression in the converter (not catched by other unit
	tests).

2006-05-25  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Added wrapper methods for GdipGetRegionHRgn and 
	GdipCreateRegionHrgn functions.
	* Region.cs: Reimplement GetHrgn and FromHrgn methods using the GDI+
	calls.

2006-05-24  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* PointConverter.cs: Fx 2.0 throws an ArgumentException in 
	CreateInstance if some values are missing from the dictionary, while
	1.x throws an NullReferenceException.
	* RectangleConverter.cs: Fx 2.0 throws an ArgumentException in 
	CreateInstance if some values are missing from the dictionary, while
	1.x throws an NullReferenceException.
	* SizeConverter.cs: Fx 2.0 throws an ArgumentException in 
	CreateInstance if some values are missing from the dictionary, while
	1.x throws an NullReferenceException.
	* SizeFConverter.cs: Fix CreateInstance to use float (not int).

2006-05-24  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Font.cs: Added a Demand for UnmanagedCode on both ToLogFont methods.
	* Graphics.cs: Added checks for null Rectangle[F] arrays in 
	FillRectangles methods and removed the check for 0-length (MS throws).
	Let EndContainer mthod throws a NullReferenceException on 1.x profile.
	* Pen.cs: Let Brush property throws a NullReferenceException on 1.x.

2006-05-24  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* Pen.cs: Clone the supplied brush in the .ctor (as the user may 
	dispose of it anytime). Make sure we're disposing our cached brush
	when disposing the pen.

2006-05-21  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* ContentAlignment.cs: Removed [Serializable] from 2.0 profile.
	* FontStyle.cs: Removed [Serializable] from 2.0 profile.
	* GraphicsUnit.cs: Removed [Serializable] from 2.0 profile.
	* KnownColor.cs: Removed [Serializable] from 2.0 profile.
	* RotateFlipType.cs: Removed [Serializable] from 2.0 profile.
	* StringAligment.cs: Removed [Serializable] from 2.0 profile.
	* StringDigitSubstitute.cs: Removed [Serializable] from 2.0 profile.
	* StringFormatFlags.cs: Removed [Serializable] from 2.0 profile.
	* StringTrimming.cs: Removed [Serializable] from 2.0 profile.
	* StringUnit.cs: Removed [Serializable] from 2.0 profile.

2006-05-17 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ImageAnimator.cs: get the FrameDelay from the image properties, if
	available. Remove ^Ms.

2006-05-17  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* Pen.cs: Get the pen color from the solid brush (when applicable). 
	Added missing validations for most properties. Always return a clone 
	of the internal brush (so no one can dispose of it in our back).

2006-05-17 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Color.cs: make it serialization-compatible with MS. Fixes bug #78265.

2006-05-17 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Bitmap.cs: (Clone) use the 'format' argument instead of the
	PixelFormat.

2006-05-15  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Graphics.cs : (FillRectangles/FillRectanglesI): when argument
	  array is empty, don't invoke GDI+. Fixed bug #78408.

2006-05-12  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* gdipFunctions.c: Fix misnamed GdipAdd*Path*String[I] API (#78383)

2006-05-11  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Icon.cs: Don't require width/height to be non-0 when creating from
	  serialized data, just require them to be square

2006-05-04  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 
 
	* Graphics.cs: Chaned DrawIcon methods to dispose the temporary bitmap
	on it's drawn.

2006-05-04  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Graphics.cs: Added a MonoTODO to PixelOffsetMode property so it shows
	(in the class status library) a note that this isn't supported with 
	libgdiplus.

2006-05-02  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* FontConverter.cs (ConvertFrom): Implemented it properly. Fixes #78269

2006-05-02  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* PointF.cs: Add operators + and - between PointF and SizeF in the
	2.0 profile (CSC 8.x can compile that, but sadly it doesn't show in as
	missing in corcompare results).

2006-05-02  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Fixed wrappers for Gdip[Begin|End]Container[2][I]
	* Graphics.cs: Fixed usage of fixed API ;-) Added MonoTODO on 
	BeginContainer methods that use rectangles and on TextContrast property 
	(all aren't currently supported in libgdiplus).

2006-05-01  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Graphics.cs: Removed MonoTODO on DrawCurve methods (it's fixed in 
	libgdiplus). Fixed minor extra/missing for corcompare.

2006-05-01 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* SizeF.cs: serialization compatibility fixes. Closes bug #78236.

2006-04-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Icon.cs: Icon AND masks are organized in strides, fixed to calculate
	  and set proper transparency. Also fixed broken calculation of AND
	  size when reading the icon. NDocGui now shows pretty buttons.

2006-04-28  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* Color.cs: corcompare fix. Remove ComVisible attribute from 2.0 build
	* Region.cs: Remove old todo that were fixed in libgdiplus.
	* Image.cs: corcompare fixes. Clone isn't virtual. Added DefaultValue
	attribute to Tag property. FromStream(Stream,bool,bool) is available
	in Fx 1.1 (probably since SP1).

2006-04-28  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Graphics.cs: Added MonoTODO on some DrawCurve methods because 
	libgdiplus doesn't use the numberOfSegments argument.

2006-04-27  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Added wrappers for GdipAddPathLine2 and 
	GdipAddPathLine2I methods (to allow adding a single point).

2006-04-27  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Added CharSet=CharSet.Unicode to GdipAddString and
	GdipAddStringI wrapper methods.

2006-04-26 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Bitmap.cs: throw when the target pixel format differs from the one
	of the image and it's an indexed format. We were failing in UnlockBits
	before.

2006-04-25  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* FontConverter.cs (FontUnitConverter): implement.   CorCompare
	for some reason does not dig into nested classes, match the
	documentation. 

	(FontNameConverter): Return the fonts available on the system. 

2006-04-25  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Icon.cs: We need to or, not and our alpha values into the
	  palette. Also, we need to actually store the altered palette
	  on the bitmap, since we are altering a copy.

2006-04-10  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Fixed wrappers for GdipCreateMatrix3[I].

2006-03-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: 
	  - GdipGetFontCollectionFamilyList: No need for complicated 
	    GlobalAlloc stuff, .Net marshals the IntPtr[] array just fine
	  - GdipDeletePrivateFontCollection: We need to pass a ref to the
	    structure. This was causing nasty crashes.
	  - GdipGetFamilyName: Switched to use StringBuilder instead of
	    manual marshalling
	* FontFamily.cs: Simplified the refreshName method, less error-prone now

2006-03-21  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 
 
	* Brush.cs: Remove unused code.
	* FontFamily.cs: Remove warnings from build.
	* gdipFunctions.cs: Add missing p/invoke calls for GdipAddString[I].

2006-03-21  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Import XFree (from libX11) so we can free the 
	memory we allocate.
	* Graphics.cs: Free the memory we get from XGetVisualInfo.

2006-03-20  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Brush.cs: Allow Dispose to free the unmanaged memory for the brush
	in every case. This has been known (in the past) to cause crashes
	in Cairo. If still true then we need to find out why!

2006-03-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Removed XCloseDisplay call from Gdi+ shutdown,
	  it was causing crashes in the finalizers (bug #77464)

2006-03-06  Jonathan Gilbert  <logic@deltaq.org>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Rewrote the StreamSeekImpl function to invalidate
	  the start_buf cached bytes whenever Seek() is actually called. If
	  Seek is not called (an invalid 'whence' value), then the buffer is
	  not invalidated. This fixes a bug with TIFF loading.

2006-03-02  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Image.cs (ISerializable.GetObjectData): Save the image in it's
	  original format. (Fixes #77673)

2006-02-28  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>,
            Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Font.cs:
	  - ToLogFont: Reworked to allow running under MS runtime and to 
	    support it being called with both boxed structs and formatted 
	    classes  (MS runtime PtrToStructure cannot marshal boxed value
	    types, but Marshal.AsAny can)
	  - Switched all usage of LOGFONTA to more generic CharSet-driven 
	    LOGFONT structure
	  - FromLogFont: Switched to use charset-agnostic GdipCreateFontFromLogfont
	* gdipStructs.cs: Dropped LOGFONTA and LOGFONTW and switched to
	  CharSet-driven LOGFONT structure (needed because of ToLogFont fix)
	* gdipFunctions.cs: Switched GdipGetLogFont, GdipCreateFontFromLogfont and
	  CreateFontIndirect to use LOGFONT structure, set to be CharSet=Auto
	  (needed because of ToLogFont fix)

2006-02-18  Duncan Mak  <duncan@novell.com>

	* Graphics.cs (DrawBeziers): Patch from Alexander Olk to fix
	possible IndexOutOfRangeException.

2006-02-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Image.cs, Bitmap.cs: Removed unneeded casts
	* Icon.cs: Fixed code to be 64bit safe

2006-01-31 Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* Font.cs: Fixes 77407

2006-01-27  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Font.cs: Ensure unmanaged memory is free correctly in ToLogFont
	even if GDIPlus.CheckStatus throws an exception;
	* Image.cs: Ensure unmanaged memory is free correctly even if 
	GDIPlus.CheckStatus throws an exception. Note: the SetPropertyItem use
	case is unclear to me (and unimplemented in libgdiplus);
	* Region.cs: Ensure unmanaged memory is free correctly in 
	GetRegionScans even if GDIPlus.CheckStatus throws an exception;

2006-01-27 Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: New gdiplus imports
	* Font.cs: Use gdiplus calls to get font height and size

2006-01-26  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* FontFamily.cs: Free the memory allocated with Marshal.AllocHGlobal.
	* Region.cs: Updated TODO to reflect current status.

2006-01-24  Konstantin Triger <kostat@mainsoft.com>

        * Font.jvm.cs, FontFamily.jvm.cs: use static container.

2006-01-19  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Icon.cs: The code wrongly assumed that the stride for the icon
	  would be the same as the stride for the bitmap. This was causing
	  memory corruption.

2006-01-18  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Icon.cs: Reworked ToBitmap() method to not use Bitmap(Stream)
	  which when calling down to MS GDI+ will create an image
	  where neither GetPixel or Save can be used on.

2006-01-18  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* gdipFunctions.cs: Added declaration for GdipCreateRegionRgnData.
	* Region.cs: Implemented .ctor(RegionData)

2006-01-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Region.cs: Revert the Region.cs check in GetHrgn as it was used
	by our Windows.Forms implementation.

2006-01-11  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Graphics.cs: Avoid creating bitmaps two times if both X and Y 
	default DPI are required (i.e. init both value in both cases).
	* Region.cs: Added null check to match MS behaviour (exception type)
	and avoid NRE (before CheckStatus is called). Added security demands
	for unmanaged code on both FromHrgn and ReleaseHrgn (2.0) methods.

2005-12-22  Jonathan Chambers <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

        * gdipFunctions.cs: Do not call GdiplusShutdown for
        now as it causes a crash on MS GDI+.

2005-12-20  Konstantin Triger <kostat@mainsoft.com>

        * Font.jvm.cs: charset support.

	* Image.cs: Implemented FromHbitmap.

2005-05-25  Jonathan Gilbert  <logic@deltaq.org>

	* Image.cs: Added retrieveGDIPalette () and storeGDIPalette ()
	  and modified the Palette property to call them. This non-
	  persistent behaviour was discovered by trial and error with
	  Microsoft's implementation. In fact, the Palette property
	  does not behave like a property at all! It is the only way an
	  instance of System.Drawing.Imaging.ColorPalette can be created,
	  and it reflects a backing store that is only updated when the
	  property 'set' method is called. Also updated Clone () since
	  the palette is no longer cached at image load time.
	* Image.cs: Added IsIndexedPixelFormat () in the same vein as
	  Image::IsAlphaPixelFormat and Image::IsCanonicalPixelFormat.
	  As such a function is not listed in MSDN nor given in
	  Microsoft's implementation, I have made it a private function
	  within the class that uses it.

	property in System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.

2004-01-20  Ravindra  <rkumar@novell.com>

	* Pen.cs: Fixed bug #52811 in Pen.Transform property. Setting
	this property was hanging and getting was throwing a NullRef
	Exception. Earlier we were passing Matrix object to and fro
	which was causing the problem. Now, we are using IntPtr.
	Thanks to Duncan for helping me.
	Also, .NET behavior is to maintain Pen.Color and Pen.Brush
	together. If color is set, a SolidBrush automatically gets
	set with the same color, Pen loses the old brush object.
	If a SolidBrush is set, Pen.Color gets the value same as that
	of brush color losing the old value. Pen shows this behavior
	now.
	* gdipFunctions.cs: Changed the signature of GdipGetPenTransform
	and GdipSetPenTransform methods to use IntPtr instead of Matrix.
