	* OdbcDataReader.cs: - uncommented code, but
	I put a FIXME: according to Brian, 
    this does not work on MS .NET
    however, we need it for Mono 
    for now. schemaRow.AcceptChanges(),
    - implement IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()
    
    * libodbc.cs: changed the DllImport from "odbc32.dll"
    to "odbc32"

	* OdbcError.cs:
	* OdbcException.cs: added dummy implementation for these missing
	classes.
