	* DbDataAdapter.cs: The original code might pass a null DataTableMapping
	value which is then used to create a RowUpdatingEventArgs
	instance. So RowUpdatingEvent handler (for instance
	CommandBuilder) could get null DataTableMapping which
	might be unexpected. The patch makes sure that a non-null
	DataTableMapping is passed.

	* DbEnumerator.cs: why does the runtime throw an invalid cast here? The
	object is an Int16... Gotta fill a bug report and when fixed undo this
	patch.

	* DbDataRecord.cs: return DbNull.Value in GetValue () if value is null.

	we do not implement yet.
