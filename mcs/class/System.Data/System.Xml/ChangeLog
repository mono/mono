	* XmlDataDocument.cs (BaseURI):
	(InnerXml):
	(IsReadOnly):
	(this):
	(LocalName):
	(Name):
	(OwnerDocument):
	(WriteContentTo):
	(WriteTo): Removed, these do not need to be redefined, as
	they are inherited from XmlDocument already.

	(CreateElement): simplifed the
	implementation. XmlDocument.CreateElement can handle String.Empty
	and null just fine.

	* XmlDataDocument.cs: Still need to print tag for the DataSet if there
	is no data at all.
