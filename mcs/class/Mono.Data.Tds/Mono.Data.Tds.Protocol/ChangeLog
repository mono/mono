	* TdsComm.cs: 
          Tds70.cs: 
                Make Tds70 work on Big Endian machines.
		BitConverter uses unsafe and returns things in host order; we need to 
		swap some values to put them back into the approrpiate order for the wire.

2004-08-09 Sureshkumar T <tsureshkumar@novell.com>
	* Tds70.cs - Prepare Method stored procedure handle read problem fixed.

2004-06-30 Umadevi S <sumadevi@novell.com>
	* Tds.cs - In the NextResult method handling TdsPacketSubType. TableName. 


2004-04-22  Sebastien Pouliot <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* Tds70.cs: Updated to match changes in Mono.Security.dll.

2004-04-05  Lluis Sanchez Gual  <lluis@ximian.com>

	* ITds.cs: Added method for reseting a connection.
	* Tds.cs: Added base implementation for ITds.Reset.
	* Tds70.cs: Implemented ITds.Reset().
	* TdsConnectionPool.cs: Implemented connection pool that can be reused by 
	  all Tds clients.

2004-04-01  Lluis Sanchez Gual  <lluis@ximian.com>

	* Tds.cs: All methods now return DBNull instead of null for null values.
	* Tds50.cs, Tds70.cs: Support parameters with DBNull value.

2003-12-21  Tim Coleman <tim@timcoleman.com>
	* Tds70.cs:
		Fix Integrated Security to work with Domain users.

2003-12-06  Sebastien Pouliot <spouliot@videotron.ca> 
	for Daniel Morgan <danielmorgan@verizon.net>

	Sebastien Pouliot (spouliot@motus.com) helped me greatly with his
	NTLM stuff.
	
	* Mono.Data.Tds.Protocol/Tds.cs
	* Mono.Data.Tds.Protocol/Tds70.cs
	* Mono.Data.Tds.Protocol/TdsConnectionParameters.cs
	* Mono.Data.Tds.Protocol/TdsPacketSubType.cs
	* Mono.Data.Tds.Protocol/TdsPacketType.cs: added NT Authentication aka
	Integrated Security aka Domain Login
	
2003-10-19  Joerg Rosenkranz <joergr@voelcker.com>

	* Tds.cs (GetStringValue): A string length of 0xFF (255) is not
	misinterpreted as special value anymore.
	
	This is a fix to bug #49835.

2003-10-03  Diego Caravana  <diego@toth.it>

	* Tds70.cs: Now handles parameters of type ReturnValue and
	InputOutput.
	(BuildParameters): skips the ReturnValue params and builds the
	set string considering the assigned value for InputOutput ones.
	(BuildProcedureCall): like the preceding one plus adds the return
	value to the final select.
	
2003-08-22  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* Tds.cs (ProcessEndToken): RecordsAffected was not filled
	correctly. I've found out that the record count was submitted for
	TdsPacketSubType.Done. So I changed the behaviour to include this
	(without deeper knowledge of the TDS protocol). Patch from Jörg
	Rosenkranz <joergr@voelcker.com>.

	This is part of a fix to bug #40315.
	
2003-05-07  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	Patches from Igor Nosyryev <nosyryev@attbi.com>
	
	* TdsComm.cs: (GetString): GetString adds extra byte to a string
	at end. It suppose to be '\0', but '\0' is valid value in .NET
	string, so this byte must not be used.
 
	* Tds.cs (GetDecimalValue):Method reads extra byte if a DECIMAL
	field contains NULL. As a result server's response is parsed
	incorrectly and this method fires an exception.

2003-01-20  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Tds70.cs:
	(FormatParameter): send input/output parameter names. This way we don't
	depend on the parameter position being different of the index in the
	parameter collection.

2002-12-10  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Tds.cs:
	(Disconnect): close the stream and set connected to false.
	(NextResult): check if after DoneProc we have a ColumnMetadata + Row,
	which holds the values for the output parameters and read them.
	(LoadRow): add the values to outputParameters if DoneProc.
	When executing a stored procedure, we execute the procedure and then
	select the parameter values.

	* Tds70.cs:
	(BuildParameters): check Parameters.

	* TdsComm.cs: added Close () to close the stream.

	* TdsConnectionParameters.cs: initialize all the string to be empty.

2002-11-04  Tim Coleman (tim@timcoleman.com)

		purpose hackery.
	* Tds42.cs:
	* Tds50.cs:
	* Tds70.cs:

        * Tds70.cs:
        * Tds80.cs:
                New classes added.  Functionality
                is split up because different protocols

        * Tds.cs:
                Remove some unnecessary code after
                the above split, and add in a whole

        * TdsComm.cs:
                Move the encoder out of constructor
