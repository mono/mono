	it from pool and allow slot to be re-used for a newly established

	* TdsDataColumnCollection.cs, Tds50.cs, Tds42.cs, Tds70.cs,
	Tds.cs: adjust for changes below.

	* TdsDataColumn.cs: use the named properties only in the 2.0
	profile. The reason is that Mono.Data.TdsClient.TdsDataReader
	needs to know if a property has been set or not. With 2.0 it is
	easy to implement using nullable types, with 1.x it would require
	using e.g. BitArray to control which field was set, and in
	addition extra code would be needed to check whether a field was
	set or not. Also, it would clutter the code with #ifdefs all over
	the map.

2008-06-30  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@gmail.com>

	* TdsDataColumn.cs: Do not inherit from Hashtable, add always set properties
	as normal properties so code can access them without doing a hashtable lookup.

                Make Tds70 work on Big Endian machines.

2004-04-01  Lluis Sanchez Gual  <lluis@ximian.com>

	* Tds.cs: All methods now return DBNull instead of null for null values.
	* Tds50.cs, Tds70.cs: Support parameters with DBNull value.

2003-12-21  Tim Coleman <tim@timcoleman.com>
	* Tds70.cs:
		Fix Integrated Security to work with Domain users.

2003-12-06  Sebastien Pouliot <spouliot@videotron.ca> 
	for Daniel Morgan <danielmorgan@verizon.net>

	Sebastien Pouliot (spouliot@motus.com) helped me greatly with his
	NTLM stuff.
	
	* Mono.Data.Tds.Protocol/Tds.cs
	* Mono.Data.Tds.Protocol/Tds70.cs
	* Mono.Data.Tds.Protocol/TdsConnectionParameters.cs
	* Mono.Data.Tds.Protocol/TdsPacketSubType.cs
	* Mono.Data.Tds.Protocol/TdsPacketType.cs: added NT Authentication aka
	Integrated Security aka Domain Login
	
2003-10-19  Joerg Rosenkranz <joergr@voelcker.com>

	* Tds.cs (GetStringValue): A string length of 0xFF (255) is not
	misinterpreted as special value anymore.
	
	This is a fix to bug #49835.

2003-10-03  Diego Caravana  <diego@toth.it>

	* Tds70.cs: Now handles parameters of type ReturnValue and
	InputOutput.
	(BuildParameters): skips the ReturnValue params and builds the
	set string considering the assigned value for InputOutput ones.
	(BuildProcedureCall): like the preceding one plus adds the return
	value to the final select.
	
2003-08-22  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* Tds.cs (ProcessEndToken): RecordsAffected was not filled
	correctly. I've found out that the record count was submitted for
	TdsPacketSubType.Done. So I changed the behaviour to include this
	(without deeper knowledge of the TDS protocol). Patch from Jörg
	Rosenkranz <joergr@voelcker.com>.

	This is part of a fix to bug #40315.
	
2003-05-07  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	Patches from Igor Nosyryev <nosyryev@attbi.com>
	
	* TdsComm.cs: (GetString): GetString adds extra byte to a string
	at end. It suppose to be '\0', but '\0' is valid value in .NET
	string, so this byte must not be used.
 
	* Tds.cs (GetDecimalValue):Method reads extra byte if a DECIMAL
	field contains NULL. As a result server's response is parsed
	incorrectly and this method fires an exception.

2003-01-20  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Tds70.cs:
	(FormatParameter): send input/output parameter names. This way we don't
	depend on the parameter position being different of the index in the
	parameter collection.

2002-12-10  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Tds.cs:
	(Disconnect): close the stream and set connected to false.
	(NextResult): check if after DoneProc we have a ColumnMetadata + Row,
	which holds the values for the output parameters and read them.
	(LoadRow): add the values to outputParameters if DoneProc.
	When executing a stored procedure, we execute the procedure and then
	select the parameter values.

	* Tds70.cs:
	(BuildParameters): check Parameters.

	* TdsComm.cs: added Close () to close the stream.

	* TdsConnectionParameters.cs: initialize all the string to be empty.

2002-11-04  Tim Coleman (tim@timcoleman.com)

	* Tds42.cs:

        * Tds70.cs:
        * Tds80.cs:
                New classes added.  Functionality
                is split up because different protocols

        * Tds.cs:
                Remove some unnecessary code after
                the above split, and add in a whole

        * TdsColumnType.cs:

        * TdsComm.cs:
                Move the encoder out of constructor

        * TdsConnectionParameters.cs:
                Small changes
