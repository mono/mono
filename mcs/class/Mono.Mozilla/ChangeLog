	* Move to main tree

2007-08-10 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Add file headers. Take out generic collections, because
	we'll need to use this on 1.1 as well.

2007-08-09 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Change external generic interfaces to Mono.WebBrowser
	namespace, while mozilla-specific stuff is Mono.Mozilla.
	Encapsulate code even further with a Manager, so that
	callers can only use what's available in the IWebBrowser
	interface by asking for a new instance from the Manager.
	Everything not in the IWebBrowser interface is private.
	Navigation control, new window creation events.

2007-07-30 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Add focus and activation management
	  Add new ICallback interface to encapsulate callbacks
	  from xulbrowser. IWebBrowser has all calls and events
	  accessible from MWF.
	  Implement mouse, focus and key handlers

2007-07-21 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* MozilaInvoke is now called Base, and encapsulates all the
	pinvokes plus a list of web controls that have been loaded
	indexed the control, with binding info (callback object and
	IntPtr to the native xulbrowser instance.
	WebBrowser.cs implements IWebBrowser and is the entry point
	to the library - the WebControl api keeps a reference and 
	calls only this.
	Add vstudio 2005 project for 2.0 api

2007-06-25 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Callback.cs, IWebBrowser.cs, WebBrowser.cs: 
	Change OnWidgetLoaded callback to send the new 	
	handle when it's called.
