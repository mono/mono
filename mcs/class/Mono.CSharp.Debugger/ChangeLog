2004-08-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* MonoSymbolFile.cs (MonoSymbolFile.ReadSymbolFile): pass name to
	MonoSymbolFile.ctor, not filename, so we load the .mdb file
	instead of the .dll.
	(MonoSymbolFile.ctor): pass FileAccess.Read to the FileStream
	ctor.

2004-08-27  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* MonoSymbolFile.cs (MonoDebuggerSupport.GetGuid): The function is
	called Module.Mono_GetGuid(), not Module.MonoDebugger_GetGuid().

	containing static wrappers for calling the `MonoDebugger_*'
	function in S.R.Assembly.

	* MonoSymbolTable.cs: Added more #region's and a comment at the
	top of the file.

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs (SourceMethod.BuildLineNumberTable): Removed
	it here since it's in MethodEntry again.

2004-01-13  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* ChangeLog, MonoSymbolTable.cs: Reviewed Ben's patches.  For
	those which are not ok, I'll add detailed comments to the source
	code.	

2003-12-28 Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@users.sourceforge.net>

	[Revision 1.41, not approved.  Martin]
	* MonoSymbolTable.cs (MethodEntry): kill more
	useless fields.

2003-12-28 Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@users.sourceforge.net>

	[Revision 1.40, not approved.  Martin]
	* MonoSymbolTable.cs (MethodEntry): Remove the
	SourceFileIndex field, we already have the info.

2003-12-28 Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@users.sourceforge.net>

	[Revision 1.39, approved.  Martin]
	* MonoSymbolTable.cs: Don't make the MethodIndexEntry
	part of the method entry class, because it just
	takes up extra space.

2003-12-28 Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@users.sourceforge.net>

	[Revisions 1.37 and 1.38; not approved.  Martin]
	* MonoSymbolTable.cs (MethodEntry.BuildLineNumberTable): Removed.

	* MonoSymbolTable.cs, MonoSymbolWriter.cs: Use
	fewer arrays, dont use arraylists with structs.

2003-12-27 Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* MonoSymbolFile.cs: Much, much better string writing.

2003-12-20 Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@users.sourceforge.net>

	[Revision 1.36, approved.  Martin]
	* MonoSymbolTable.cs: Fewer StringBuilder allocs.

2003-12-08  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs: Create ArrayLists only when needed.

2003-12-07 Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@users.sourceforge.net>

	[Revision 1.35, approved.  Martin]
	* MonoSymbolTable.cs: It is faster to do a linear search
	than it is to make a hashtable. Even though the linear
	search is O(n^2) while the hashtable is O(n), the allocation
	cost for a hashtable is *very* high, especially when only
	a few members will be added.

2003-09-06  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* MonoSymbolFile.cs: Removed debugging output.

2003-08-05  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	field.  Specifies whether two local variables have the same name.

2003-03-13  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	Added basic support for lexical scopes.  This is just to tell a
	debugger that a local variable is only available in a specific
	lexical scope and that another variable of the same name may exist
	in another lexical scope.  See debugger/test/TestLexicalScope.cs
	for examples.

	* MonoSymbolTable.cs (LexicalScopeEntry): New class.
	(LocalVariableEntry): Added `BlockIndex' field which specifies the
	lexical scope of this variable.

	ClassTypeIndex; provide this for all methods so we can get the
	class of static methods.

2003-02-10  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* Mono.CSharp.Debugger.build: passing the /r using an 'arg' node works.
	The <include> node wasn't getting to the compiler. This fixes build
	breakage on cygwin.

	* MonoSymbolFile.cs: Qualify which Min method. Fixes build breakage
	on cygwin.

2003-02-09  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs (MonoSymbolWriter.ctor): We don't need the
	`mbuilder_array' anymore.

2003-02-09  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs (SourceFile): Derive from SourceFileEntry.
	(SourceBlock): We don't need source lines here.

	so we don't need to do this here.

2003-02-09  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs: Ooops, I forgot to remove this.

2003-02-08  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* MonoSymbolTable.cs: Set version number to 27.  Added a source
	file table which is used to search a method by source file + line number.

2002-09-21  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoSymbolTable.cs: Set version number to 26.  Removed all the dynamic
	stuff, this library now just deals with the compiler generated symbol table.
	The dynamic stuff is private between the JIT and the debugger.

2002-09-21  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoSymbolTable.cs: Set version number to 25.  Added information about
	local variables.

	about parameters and local variables.

2002-09-20  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs: Use fullly qualified name for
	System.Diagnostics.SymbolStore.ISymbolWriter rather than `using' this
	namespace.  This allows us to use the name `ISymbolWriter' in our own
	code.

2002-09-18  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoSymbolTable.cs: Set version number to 21.  Encode the source file

2002-08-27  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoSymbolTable.cs: Changed the file format in a way that allows us
	open it read-only and to use a specially malloced area for all the
	dynamic data.	

2002-08-25  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoSymbolTableReader.cs: New file.  This is the reader for the
	new symbol file format.

2002-08-24  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoSymbolTable.cs, MonoSymbolTableWriter.cs: New files.  This
	creates a binary application.dbg file which will be used by the
	JIT to display source lines for exceptions.

	* list.unix: Disabled the dwarf file writer in the build.

2002-08-23  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs (MonoSymbolWriter.Initialize): Added
	assembly name argument.  Since the symbol writer needs to read the
	final assembly, we need to give it its full pathname.

2002-08-23  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* makefile.gnu, list.unix: Added.

2002-07-05  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	and classes.

2002-05-30  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* IMonoSymbolWriter (IMonoSymbolWriter): Added custom `Initialize' method.

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs (Initialize): The ISymbolWriter's `Initialize' method
	is no longer supported and throws an exception.

	to the constructor to pass command line arguments.

	* gdb-csharp-support.patch: Updated for GDB 5.2.

2002-05-30  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs (MonoSymbolWriter): The constructor now get's the

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs (ISourceMethod): Added `FullName' and `Parameters'.
	(ITypeHandle): New interface.

	* DwarfFileWriter.cs: Largely reorganized the type writing code.  Types are
	now represented by ITypeHandle objects which are stored in a per-dwarf-writer
	hash table.  At the moment, all types still need to be in one compile unit due
	to lacking support in gdb - but this new type code here already supports this.

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs: Moved all the subclasses to the top-level and made them
	public, cleaned up the code, put everything into one compile unit.
	(DefineLocalVariable): Added a version of this function which takes useful args.

2002-05-22  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs (IMonoSymbolWriter): Added `Sources' and `Methods'
	properties.

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs (WriteSymbolTable): New public method.  Moved the

2002-05-22  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs (IVariable): Replaced Token with `ISourceMethod Method'.

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs (MonoSymbolWriter): The constructor now has an additional
	ModuleBuilder argument.
	(OpenMethod): Immediately call the `get_method' interncall to get the MethodBase
	from the token, then store the MethodBase instead of the token.  The token may
	still change during the metadata library's fixup process.
	(DoFixups): When the image has been written to disk, call the GetToken () method
	on all MethodBuilders and all ConstructorBuilders to get the final metadata tokens.

2002-05-22  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* AssemblerWriterI386.cs: Don't use GNU extensions and produce assembler
	output which is free of comments and extra whitespaces so that it's suitable
	for `as -f'.

2002-05-22  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs (ISourceMethod): Replaced `MethodInfo MethodInfo' with
	`MethodBase MethodBase' and added `Type ReturnType'.  We're now correctly
	dealing with constructors and not crashing anymore.

2002-05-21  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs: Write a special line number table which can be read
	in by the metadata library to get line number information in backtraces.

2002-05-06  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs (MonoSymbolWriter.Close): Use Assembly.LoadFrom (), not
	AppDomain.Load () to load the assembly.

2002-04-26  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* gdb-csharp-support.patch: A patch for GDB (against the latest CVS version)
	to implement C# support.

	* csharp-lang.c, csharp-lang.h, csharp-mono-lang.c: Copy these into your GDB
	source directory after applying the patch.

2002-04-26  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs (DieInternalString): Removed.

2002-04-25  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs: Reflect latest MonoString changes.

2002-04-13  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs (ISourceBlock): Added `Blocks' property and `AddBlock'
	method to support nested blocks.

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs: Correctly handle nested blocks.

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs (DieMember): Provide info for all fields, not just for
	public ones; also added DW_AT_accessibility.
	(DieVariable): Reflected latest debug-symfile.c changes.

2002-04-12  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

2002-04-12  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs (DieVariable): Provide info about the variable's
	lifetime using DW_AT_begin_scope and a new baulig extension DW_AT_end_scope.

2002-03-29  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* AssemblerWriterI386.cs: Rewrote most of the string output function, do the
	number->string conversion manually. It's now taking about 15 seconds to write
	a symbol file for MCS, no longer more than a minute.

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs: Added some profiling code, speeded things up, fixed
	a few bugs.

2002-03-25  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs (CreateType): Return a `DieType'.
	(RegisterType): Add the type to the type hash before creating dependency types
	so we don't get recursion loops.
	(RegisterPointerType): New func to register a "pointer to type" type.
	(DieTypeDef, DiePointerType, DieArrayType, DieStringType, DieClassType): New
	types; added support for strings, arrays and basic support for classes.
	
2002-03-24  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs: Killed all methods in this interface, no longer needed.

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs (MonoSymbolWriter): The constructor now takes a string
	argument which is the full pathname of the assembly - you must call Close()
	after the assembly has been written to disk since the symbol writer needs to
	load the finished assembly to get its metadata.

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs: Added support for enums and structs.
	
2002-03-24  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs: Added support for method parameters.

2002-03-24  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* IMonoSymbolWriter.cs (IMonoSymbolWriter): Removed my custom OpenMethod(),
	we're now using the ISymbolWriter's method.
	(IVariable): Added `byte[] Signature' property.

	* MonoSymbolWriter.cs (SetAssembly): New method. This must be called before
	Close(); the assembly parameter is the already-written assembly, ie. it must
	contain the full metadata.
	(OpenMethod): Only take the token argument and set MethodInfo later in DoFixups.
	(SetMethodSourceRange): You must call this function to tell the symbol writer
	in which source file the method is defined.
	(DefineLocal): Store the signature in the local.
	(DoFixups): Use two new interncalls to set the SourceMethod's MethodInfo field
	and the LocalVariable's Type field.

	(ISourceLine): Renamed Line to Row, added Column. Added OffsetType and Offset.

	* MonoDwarfFileWriter.cs (MonoDwarfFileWriter.DieLexicalBlock): New class.
	(MonoDwarfFileWriter.DieMethodVariable): New class.
