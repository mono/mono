	* Makefile : track the timestamp so tar does not run when not needed
	* xsdtest.cs : fix the case of the directory name

2004-01-17  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Makefile : report details.

2004-12-15  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* xsdtest.cs : added --v2 option that uses XmlReader.Create()
	  instead of XmlValidatingReader.

2004-12-10  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* xsdtest.cs : improved significantly. Enabled reporting to file,
	  immediate stop on exception, xml reporting, and so on.
	  Run mono xsdtest.exe --help for details.
	* Makefile : now "make test" becomes "make run-test" and it generates
	  TestResult.xml (of my own format).
	* README : updated info.

2004-03-04  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Makefile : made "make test" independent of "make" so that extraneous
	  archive extraction won't be run every time (for automated tests).

2004-01-20  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Added set of Post Schema Compilation Information tests, i.e.
	  xs-psci-compare.cs and psci-ms-all.zip.
	* Makefile: Added test-psci target.
	* README: Added notes on PSCI tests (however it is not for today's
	  implementation, but for the very near future with bunch of fixes)

2004-01-08  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* xsdtest.cs : XmlReaders should be closed in case of errors.

2004-01-05  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* README, Makefile, test-masters.tar.gz, xsdtest.cs : Initial checkin.
