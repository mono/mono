	* ManagedXslTransform.cs: remove verbose debugging messages

2003-07-28 Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* XslTransform.cs: Use the new XslTransformImpl class
	* XslTransformImpl.cs: An abstract class for Xsl transforms
	* UnmanagedXslTransform.cs: Contains the code that was in
	XslTransform.cs

2003-07-27  Piers Haken	<piersh@friskit.com>

	* XsltArgumentList.cs:
		fix type conversions in ValidateParam
		allow creating params with null namespaceUri

2003-07-05  Atsushi Enomoto <ginga@kit.hi-ho.ne.jp>

	* XslTransform.cs : fixed WriteTree() and WriteCurrentNode() to follow
	  the recent changes of XPathNavigator implementations.

2003-07-02  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* XslTransform.cs (Transform): Call xsltSaveResultToFilename instead
	of first reading the result into a string to conserve memory.

2003-06-30  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* XslTransform.cs (GetStringFromDocument): Read the result using
	xsltSaveResultToString, since the XML document returned by
	applyStylesheet is missing the output processing done due to the
	usage of the xsl:output directive.

2003-06-21  Atsushi Enomoto <ginga@kit.hi-ho.ne.jp>

	* XslTransform.cs : Fixed Transform (string, string) not to call
	  File.OpenWrite() that *appends* (not truncates) existing files.

2003-06-01  Joshua Tauberer <tauberer@for.net>

	* XslTransform.cs: Cache extension object delegates
	between calls to Transform.

2003-05-28  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* XslTransform.cs: fixed NullReferenceExceptions after the last
	change (which, btw, should have included a ChangeLog entry).

2003-05-27  Joshua Tauberer <tauberer@for.net>

        * XslTransform.cs: Initial support for extension objects.
	Known issues:
		-Extension method signatures must match exactly to the
		types of parameters that the method is called with from 
		the stylesheet.

		-Node set parameters are converted to an ArrayList of
		strings.

2003-05-27  Ben Maurer <bmaurer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* XslTransform.cs: unsafe classes need unsafe!

2003-05-11  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* XslTransform.cs: fixed bug #42739.

2003-05-11  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* XslTransform.cs: fixed bug #42747.

2003-05-01  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* XslTransform.cs: flush the writers when done. Fixes bug #42040.

2003-03-10  Alan Tam <Tam@SiuLung.com>

	* XslTransform.cs: Fixed a bug when no args is passed

2003-03-10  Alan Tam <Tam@SiuLung.com>

	* XslTransform.cs: Implemented boolean, number and string parameters.
	(Node Set and Node Iterator parameters and Extension Objects are left.)
	* XsltAttributeList.cs: Loosened access modifiers.

2003-02-20  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* XslTransform.cs: Remove confusing and unused parameter.

2003-01-24  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* XslTransform.cs: don't free the xml document used for the style sheet.
	xmlFreeStylesheet already does it. Correctly close the element tag for
	elements that don't have children. Added a couple of checks more.

2003-01-23  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* XslTransform.cs: fixed a couple of Transform overloads and changed the
	library name in DllImport to make it work on windows too.

2003-01-22  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* XslTransform.cs: implemented all Load and Transform methods. It uses
	libxml2 and libxslt. No more temp files. It's slow and memory consuming,
	but, well, that's XSLT... ;-). Idea from Zdravko Tashev.

	Now the Xsl web control works.

2002-09-23  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* XslTransform.cs (Laod): Implemented the simple version that
	takes one XPathNavigator as argument.
	(Save): New private method for recreating the XML in text from a
	XPathNavigator
	(WriteCurrentNode):
	(WriteTree): private methods for generating the text XML from the
	XPathNavigator tree.

2002-09-20  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* XslTransform.cs (Load): Implemented the methods, not
	including the ones that deal with XPathNavigator (hopefully those
	will come later).
	(Transform): Implemented the version that saves directly to a file.
	(Save): New private method for recreating the XML in text from
	from an XmlReader

	We're now P/Invoking libxslt for doing XSLT work.

2002-06-23  Piers Haken <piersh@friskit.com>
	
	* XsltContext.cs: added 'PreserveWhitespace' abstract method
