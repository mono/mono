	docs say it is the "The concatenated values of the node and all
	the children of the node.". I wrote some test programs and
	couldn't get any of the derived nodes to AppendChild. For now,
	InnerText == Data == Value.

	* XmlDocumentType.cs (XmlDocumentType): Fix the constructor now
	that we can properly chain constructors.

	last linked child.  Set XmlNode base class to return false for IsReadOnly().
	Implemented GetEnumerator() and RemoveChild().
	
	* XmlNodeListChildren.cs: Now stores the parent instead of the last child.
	This is to support the behavior that the Enumerator doesn't become invalid

	duplicated in XmlDocument and XmlElement into XmlNode so that it
	wouldn't have to be duplicated in XmlAttribute, too.

	* XmlNodeList.cs, XmlDocument.cs, XmlLinkedNode.cs,
	XmlNode.cs: Formatting.

2002-03-06  Kral Ferch <kral_ferch@hotmail.com>

	* XmlNode.cs: Rewrote this class from scratch with
	MonoToDo attribs and NotImplementedExceptions.  Now defines an
	internal LastLinkedNode property to aid the new implementation.
	XmlNodes only have ref to owner doc and parent nodes now.
	
	* XmlLinkedNode.cs: Added NextLinkedSibling internal property
	and ref to next sibling to support walking our circular child
	node list.
	
	* XmlDocument.cs: Added ref to last child node and overrides

	our circular child node list.
	
2002-03-02  Kral Ferch <kral_ferch@hotmail.com>

	it out. This should (hopefully) be correct.

2002-02-26  Jason Diamond <jason@injektilo.org>

	* XmlTextReader.cs: Apparently Microsoft's implementation treats
	namespace declarations as attributes so we do now, too.

	* XmlNamespaceManager.cs: HasNamespace fixed so that it only
	checks the current scope.

2002-02-26  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* XmlDocument.cs, XmlElement.cs, XmlNode.xs, XmlNodeList.cs,
