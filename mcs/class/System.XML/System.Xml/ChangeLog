2002-03-15  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* XmlEntity.cs: Added to CVS. Need to implement BaseURI and
	InnerText once I know what they do.

	* XmlDocumentType.cs (XmlDocumentType): Fix the constructor now
	that we can properly chain constructors.
	(CloneNode): implemented.
	(WriteContentTo): Removed MonoTODO attribute as this method has no
	effect in this class.

	* XmlProcessingInstruction.cs (Value): Added the missing Set
	block.
	(InnerText): Added in, but not implemented.

2002-03-14  Kral Ferch  <kral_ferch@hotmail.com>

	* XmlTextWriter.cs: implemented constructors and 
	WriteCData and WriteComment.

2002-03-14  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* XmlDocument.cs: Moved the NodeChanged EventHandler to its own
	file, and updated the callbacks to reflect the change.
	(XmlDocument): Added the NameTable constructor.
	(NameTable): Also the NameTable property.

	* XmlNodeChangedEventHandler.cs: Added, replacing the version that
	was in XmlDocument.cs. It has two arguments now (object,
	EventArgs) , instead of one (object).

2002-03-14  Kral Ferch  <kral_ferch@hotmail.com>

	* XmlWriter.cs: Formatting.
	
	* XmlTextWriter.cs: Initial checkin.
	
2002-03-14  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* Validation.cs: Removed, replaced by ValidationType.cs.

	* ValidationType.cs: Added.

2002-03-13  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* XmlException.cs: Made it [Serializable], implemented good ol'
	GetObjectData, and the serialization constructor.

	* XmlNamedNodeMap.cs (SetNamedItem): Check for the Name property.
	(SetNamedItem): Reverted (added back in) the patch with the
	ReadOnly checks. "Don't doubt yourself, my son... you were right!"

	* XmlNamedNodeMap.cs (GetEnumerator): piggyback on the ArrayList implementation.
	(GetNamedItem (string, string)): implemented.
	(RemoveNamedItem): implemented.
	(SetNamedItem): implemented.

2002-03-12  Kral Ferch  <kral_ferch@hotmail.com>

	* XmlAttribute.cs: Moved a method from amongst properties down to
	it's alphabetical position in the methods section.
	
	* XmlNode.cs: Passes in 'this' to XmlNodeList constructor instead of
	last linked child.  Set XmlNode base class to return false for IsReadOnly().
	Implemented GetEnumerator() and RemoveChild().
	
	* XmlNodeListChildren.cs: Now stores the parent instead of the last child.
	This is to support the behavior that the Enumerator doesn't become invalid
	when changes to the children occur.  Flushed out rest of implementation for
	MoveNext, Current, and Reset.

2002-03-12  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* XmlCharacterData.cs: Reformatted the properties for better readability.

	* XmlLinkedNode.cs: Removed the awful boxy comments.

	* XmlNamedNodeMap.cs (Count):
	(Item): Implemented. Tests will be coming.

	* XmlEntityReference.cs: 
	* XmlSignificantWhitespace.cs: Implemented these classes except for
	the Clone, WriteContentTo and WriteTo methods. Will have to
	investigate into these later.

2002-03-11  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* IHasXmlNode.cs: Added to CVS.

2002-03-08  Jason Diamond <jason@injektilo.org>

	property.

2002-03-08  Jason Diamond <jason@injektilo.org>

	* XmlTextReader.cs: Implemented MoveToElement and MoveToFirstAttribute.

2002-03-08  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* DomEncodingType.cs, TreePosition.cs, XPathNodeType.cs, XmlDataType.cs,
	XmlExceptionCode.cs, XmlSortOrder.cs, XmlUtil.cs: Removed files.

2002-03-08  Jason Diamond  <jason@injektilo.org>

	* XmlAttribute.cs: Attribute nodes are supposed to store their values
	as child nodes so updated to reflect that.

	* XmlDocument.cs, XmlElement.cs, XmlNode.cs: Moved code that was
	duplicated in XmlDocument and XmlElement into XmlNode so that it
	wouldn't have to be duplicated in XmlAttribute, too.

2002-03-08  Kral Ferch <kral_ferch@hotmail.com>

	* XmlNodeList.cs, XmlDocument.cs, XmlLinkedNode.cs,
	XmlNode.cs: Formatting.
	
	* XmlNodeListChildren.cs: Implementation of XmlNodeList
	for XmlNode.ChildNodes property.
	
	* XmlNodeListAsArrayList.cs: Removed file.  Using different
	data structure (circular list) in XmlNode so this file
	is no longer valid.
	
	* XmlDocument.cs, XmlElement.cs: New ChildNodes tests found
	bug in setter property of LastLinkedChild so fixed it.
	
2002-03-06  Jason Diamond  <jason@injektilo.org>

	* XmlInputSource.cs, XmlNames_1_0.cs, XmlParse.cs: Removed files.
	We already have a parser in XmlTextReader.

	* XmlException.cs: Removed constructor accepting XmlInputSource.

2002-03-06  Kral Ferch <kral_ferch@hotmail.com>

	* XmlNode.cs: Rewrote this class from scratch with
	MonoToDo attribs and NotImplementedExceptions.  Now defines an
	internal LastLinkedNode property to aid the new implementation.
	XmlNodes only have ref to owner doc and parent nodes now.
	
	* XmlLinkedNode.cs: Added NextLinkedSibling internal property
	and ref to next sibling to support walking our circular child
	node list.
	
	* XmlDocument.cs: Added ref to last child node and overrides
	XmlNode's internal LastLinkedChild property to support walking
	our circular child node list.
	
2002-03-02  Kral Ferch <kral_ferch@hotmail.com>

	* XmlProcessingInstructions.cs: Class was empty.  Implemented
	constructor, properties, and CloneNode() method.  Put in
	MonoToDo attrib for remaining methods.

	* XmlComment.cs: Reformatted and put in MonoToDo attribs.
	Got rid of helper methods and fields since they were no
	longer needed.

	* XmlLinkedNode.cs: Reformatted and put in MonoToDo attribs.

	* XmlDocument.cs: Added code to Load(XmlReader) to create XmlComment,
	XmlCDataSection, and XmlProcessingInstruction nodes. Implemented
	Createxxx() methods for those three node types.

2002-03-02  Jason Diamond <jason@injektilo.org>

	* XmlDocument.cs: Implemented the remaining CreateElement and
	CreateAttribute methods.

2002-03-02  Jason Diamond <jason@injektilo.org>

	* XmlTextReader.cs: Implemented MoveToNextAttribute().

	* XmlDocument.cs: Reformatted. Adding missing methods and MonoTODO
	attributes. Create attribute nodes while loading. Implemented
	Load(string) and CreateTextNode().

	* XmlCharacterData.cs, XmlText.cs: Re-implemented.

	* XmlCDataSection.cs, XmlComment.cs: Call correct constructor in 
	XmlCharacterData.

	* XmlNamedNodeMap.cs, XmlAttributeCollection.cs: Stubbed out.

2002-03-02  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* XmlAttribute.cs : Using fix.

2002-03-02  Jason Diamond <jason@injektilo.org>

	the name table.

2002-02-28  Jason Diamond <jason@injektilo.org>

	* XmlDocument.cs, XmlNode.cs: Initial implementation of LoadXml 
	courtesy of Kral Ferch <kral.ferch@hotmail.com>.

	attributes.

2002-02-26  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* XmlCDataSection.cs: Initial implementation.

	* NameTable.cs: Fixed the whole thing. Wrote a NUnit test to test
	it out. This should (hopefully) be correct.

2002-02-26  Jason Diamond <jason@injektilo.org>

	* XmlTextReader.cs: Apparently Microsoft's implementation treats
	namespace declarations as attributes so we do now, too.

	* XmlNamespaceManager.cs: HasNamespace fixed so that it only
	checks the current scope.

2002-02-26  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* XmlDocumentType.cs: Added a few hacks here and there to
	temporarily fix the "I broke the build issue".

2002-02-25  Jason Diamond <jason@injektilo.org>

	* XmlDocument.cs, XmlElement.cs, XmlNode.xs, XmlNodeList.cs,
	XmlNodeListAsArrayList.cs: Multiple fixes necessary to get
	simple test to pass. The existing code is really shitty so I'll
	probably start writing tests and refactoring before much else 
	can get done.

2002-02-25  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* NameTable.cs: Implemented.

	* XmlDeclaration.cs: It should inherit from XmlLinkedNode, not XmlNode.

	elements.

2002-02-23  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* ChangeLog: Add the change log to this directory

	* XmlQualifiedName.cs: Fixed compile errors so it would build. Still has
	MonoTODO's
