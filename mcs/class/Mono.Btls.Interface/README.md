Mono.Btls.Interface
===================

The purpose of this assembly is to allow test suites such as xamarin/web-tests
(https://github.com/xamarin/web-tests/tree/stable) to test parts of BTLS without
making System.dll internals visible.

It should not be considered a stable and maintained API for third parties.
