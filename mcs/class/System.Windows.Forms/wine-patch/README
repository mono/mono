System.Windows.Forms wine-patch README

After applying the patch to wine, run "autoconf" and then 
./configure in the wine directory and 'make && make depend && make install'.

Also, once the install is done you will need to create symbolic links for
all the dlls you plan on using in System.Windows.Forms:

cd /usr/local/lib
for i in wine/*dll.so; do ln -s $i lib`basename $i`; done
