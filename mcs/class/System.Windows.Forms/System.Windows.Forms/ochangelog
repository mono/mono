    	have the WndProc callback in the stub application
    	* Control.cs: use new registered class, implemented WndProc 
    	functionality
    	* NativeWindow.cs: Now using the WndProc handler again. The window 
    	class is now registered in C# code instead of the helper function
    	in the stub shared library.
    	* NativeWindowTest.cs: using the new registered class
    	* Win32.cs: added more Win32 definitions, added DllImport and helper
    	function in stub application to register the window class.
    	* monostart.c: no longer being used, tagged for deletion. no longer
    	registering the class and WNDPROC inside the stub application
    	* monostub.c: Simplified the stub application and am now registering
    	the window class and WNDPROC callback in C# code. This is now the only 
    	file that is used in the stub application. In order to simplify the 
    	code the #include <windows.h> was removed due to overlap with the 
    	jit.h include file but some definitions from windows.h are included
    	in this file. WinMain and MonoRegisterClass are the only functions
    	that exist in this file and application.
    	* makefile: removed monostart.c from the build, added Test.exe to 
    	the build
