               Random things to look out for when writing or using 
                       code in Managed.Windows.Forms
===========================================================================

* Don't do anything that causes the <control>.DeviceContext to be recreated 
  when inside the drawing routine. Chances are the drawing routine was 
  passed <control>.DeviceContext. If an event, for example a resize, that
  causes <control>.DeviceContext to be recreated, is initiated by the 
  drawing function, the Graphics object passed to it will no longer be valid.
  Remember that resizing a control results in recreating <control>.DeviceContext
  and this in turn results in destroying the old <control>.DeviceContext.

* If you're implementing a theme and you need to know about certain states
  of the control, you have to access the internal variables of the control
  to get those states. We should probably expose those vars that are used
  by themes as properties. We'll watch which are needed and 'propertyize'
  them.
