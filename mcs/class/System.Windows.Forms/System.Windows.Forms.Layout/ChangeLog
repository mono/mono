	[Fixes bug #354676]

2007-12-13  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TableLayout.cs: Use ExplicitBounds so that we get the user requested

	[Fixes bug #346246]

2007-10-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TableLayout.cs: Revert the last change to TableLayout.  It breaks

	* TableLayout.cs: When calculating the size of AutoSize row/columns,

	* DefaultLayout.cs: Only LayoutAutoSizeContainer if the container is

	[Fixes bug #81843]

2007-06-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DefaultLayout.cs: When calculating autosize children, default to

	of using SetImplicitBounds.

	modifying Control.Bounds.

2007-02-28  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DefaultLayout.cs: Use ClientRectangle instead of DisplayRectangle
	to layout children because DisplayRectangle can be overridden.
	[Fixes bug #80917]

2007-02-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* FlowLayout.cs: Add support for laying out ToolStrips, which
	use ToolStripItems instead of Controls.

2007-01-29  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

2007-01-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DefaultLayout.cs: Remove special loop for Dock.Fill and handle
	it with the other docking code.  [Fixes bug #80227]

2007-01-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	Control.ControlLayoutType property, as well as
	Control.VisibleInternal (and fix a couple of unit tests which were
	broken due to use of Visible here.)

2006-12-25  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DefaultLayout.cs: invert the tests for anchoring to make the
	code a little more compact.

2006-12-25  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	all uses over to Control.Controls.

2006-12-04  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ArrangedElementCollection.cs: fix up corcompare for this file.
	we need to make all the interface methods explicit, not public,

	(we also call them from the explicit implementations.)
