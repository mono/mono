This RTF parser was originally based on a C-based RTF parser written 
by Paul DuBois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu). It came with the following license:

 * This software may be redistributed without restriction and used for
 * any purpose whatsoever.

and was part of the code found in the 'rewind' project.
