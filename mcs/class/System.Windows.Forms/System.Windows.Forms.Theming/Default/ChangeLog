	* TabControlPainter.cs: Use TabControl.Font instead of the values of
	TabPage.Font.
	Fixes bits of #551032.

2010-06-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TabControlPainter.cs: Actually draw the focus rectangle - TabControl
	ignores the value of ShowFocusCues. Also, properly compute the bounds
	for the focus rectangle, since it should include the padding of the
	tab page.
	Fixes bits of #515045.

2010-05-17  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TabControlPainter.cs: Don't use FocusRectSpacing or BorderThickess
	to calculate the interior rectangle to draw the tab contents, as
	TabControl.Padding is enough - we had been ignoring it. This make
	should our tab look more like that one in .net.

2010-05-17  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TabControlPainter.cs: When drawing tabs, use TabControl.Padding into
	account for the interior rectangle for the text/image contents.
	Fixes the remaining bits of #604034.

0201-05-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TabControlPainter.cs: The text for our tabs should always be
	vertically centered, and it should be horizontally centered if the
	size mode is Fixed. Patch from Thomas Goldstein (stifu@free.fr).
	Fixes part of #599841.

2010-05-15  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TabControlPainter.cs: Reduce the height for our default item size,
	as we were ignoring the padding before.

2008-10-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	text.

2008-10-08  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	rectangle with padding. Also break some lines that theres more than 120
	characters.

2008-09-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TabControlPainter.cs: Add 1 pixel to the tab text rectangle

	* TabControlPainter.cs: Added DrawScrollButton, GetButtonState.

2008-06-09  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TabControlPainter.cs: When calculating the display rectangle for
	TabPage elements, don't include TabControlSelectedDelta.Y as part of
	the page height, since it is only added ad the end (this is the way
	it's done in TabControl). This way having a lot of pages with
	Multiline as true doesn't add much extra space between the tab pages
	labels and the actual tab pages area.
	Fixes #393912.

2008-05-21  George Giolfan <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>
