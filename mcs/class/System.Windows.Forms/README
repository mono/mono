Managed.Windows.Forms README

* Introduction

Managed.Windows.Forms is a managed implementation of
System.Windows.Forms.  It implements a driver interface to allow
running on multiple windowing systems, for example X11 or Windows. All
controls are implemented in managed code, using System.Drawing to draw
them.


* Status

This library is in a beta state.  Development is still proceeding as
at a rapid page on the 1.1 codebase.  A limitted number of 2.0
controls have been implemented, but the 2.0 api is not supported at
this time.  Bug reports are welcome.  Please use
http://bugzilla.ximian.com/


* Contributions

Contributions are most welcome.  These can come in many different
forms, depending on what you're interested in working on.  2.0
controls need a lot of work, so ask on the mailing list or in irc if
someone is working on it already, and if not, start in on it.  Also,
the unit tests need a lot of work.  We can always use more of them,
and there are still a small number of them which pass on MS .NET and
fail on MWF.  For code contributions, please check the 'Guidelines'
file.
