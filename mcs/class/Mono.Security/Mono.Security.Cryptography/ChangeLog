	* RSAManaged.cs: KeySize is now always a multiple of 8 bits. 
	Fix #66929.

2004-06-23  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SymmetricTransform.cs: Reduce by one the number of block when 
	decrypting. This operation was in CryptoStream before but is only
	required for decryption (which CryptoStream can't know). 
	Fix bug #60573.

2004-05-27  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* ARC4Managed.cs: Added missing exception handling in TransformBlock 
	and TransformFinalBlock.
	* SymmetricTransform.cs: Fixed possible integer overflow. Added 
	missing exception handling in TransformBlock and TransformFinalBlock.

2004-05-10  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* PKCS8.cs: Fixed negative Version check.
	* MD2Managed.cs: Added readonly to static array constants.
	* MD4Managed.cs: Removed unrequired memory allocation in MD4Transform.

2004-05-01  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CryptoConvert.cs: Added support for truncated, but still valid, RSA
	private key blob. Fix #57941 (couldn't sign with nunit key).
	* RSAManaged.cs: Normalized the size of D when not present. This 
	allows us to output a compatible base64 representation of 1024bits 0.

2004-04-28  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SymmetricTransform.cs: Fixed bug when offset > 0 in destination 
	buffer.

2004-04-22  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CryptoConvert.cs: FxCop-ized. Sealed class. Use Buffer.BlockCopy.
	* CryptoTools.cs: FxCop-ized. Sealed KeyBuilder class. Delay creation
	of RNG object. Use Buffer.BlockCopy.
	* DiffieHellman.cs: FxCop-ized. Removed public constructor.
	* DiffieHellmanManaged.cs: FxCop-ized. Actualized with changes from
	BigInteger.
	* KeyPairPersistance.cs: FxCop-ized. Updated version for management
	of keypairs.
	* MD2Managed.cs: Use Buffer.BlockCopy instead of Array.Copy.
	* PKCS1.cs: FxCop-ized. Sealed class. Use Buffer.BlockCopy instead of
	Array.Copy. Also includes endian patches from Bernie Solomon.
	* PKCS8.cs: FxCop-ized. Sealed class. 
	* RSAManaged.cs: FxCop-ized. Actualized with changes from BigInteger.
	* SymmetricTransform.cs: Use Buffer.BlockCopy instead of Array.Copy.

2004-04-20  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CryptoConvert.cs: Synched with corlib version to get endian fixes 
	from Bernie Solomon.

2004-03-23  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CryptoConvert.cs: Added exception for null and bad parameters.
	* RSAManaged.cs: CryptographicException thrown when trying to export
	the private key when only the public key is present (CRT aware).

2004-03-22  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CryptoConvert.cs: Added new methods to convert [From|To]Hex. Added
	new version of FromCapiPublicKeyBlob with an integer offset.

2004-03-10  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* PKCS8.cs: Added EncodeRSA, EncodeDSA and completed GetBytes() so it
	is now possible to encode PKCS8 files (this is required to encode 
	PKCS12 files).

2004-02-15  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* ARC4Managed.cs: Removed all % 256 (modulo) because typecasting to 
	byte already ensure the result would be correct (as suggested by 
	Technoboy). Now use KeyBuilder to create new keys.

2004-02-13  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* DHKeyGeneration.cs: New. Enumuration of possible key generation for
	Diffie-Hellman. Contributed by Pieter Philippaerts (mentalis.org).
	* DHParameters.cs: New. Structure to hold the different elements of a
	Diffie-Hellman key. Contributed by Pieter Philippaerts (mentalis.org).
	* DiffieHellman.cs: New. Astract class as base for all Diffie-Hellman
	implementations. Contributed by Pieter Philippaerts (mentalis.org).
	* DiffieHellmanManaged.cs: New. Managed implementation of the Diffie-
	Hellman key agreement algorithm. Contributed by Pieter Philippaerts.

2004-02-09  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* PKCS1.cs: New. Copied from corlib. Required for RSAManaged.
	* RSAManaged.cs: New. Copied from corlib. Required for TLS - some
	parts (MD5SHA1) cannot work with the default RSACryptoServiceProvider.

2004-02-06  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* CryptoTools.cs: New. Copied from corlib to offer the sames services
	to symmetric algorithms in Mono.Security assembly.
	* KeyPairPersistance.cs: Provides a similar to CryptoAPI persistence 
	mechanism for keypairs (based on CspParameters).
	* SymmetricTransform.cs: New. Copied from corlib to offer the sames 
	services to symmetric algorithms in Mono.Security assembly.

2004-01-12  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* CryptoConvert.cs: RSA doesn't start with a Q - at least that what
	a strongname told me. Sorry Ron :(

2003-11-27  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* MD4.cs: New. Asbtract class for all MD4 implementations. WARNING:
	The MD4 algorithm is BROKEN (collisions) and SHOULDN'T be used in 
	NEW designs. However some higher level algorithms (like NTLM) requires 
	MD4 (and may even be secure using it). YOU'RE WARNED!
	* MD4Managed.cs: New. Managed implementation of MD4 (RFC1320).
	* PKCS8.cs: New. Added Private-Key Information Syntax Standard as a 
	building block for PKCS12.

2003-10-30  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* CryptoConvert.cs: Fixed strongname generation for small exponents 
	(like 17). Part of the fixed for bug #50341.

2003-06-19  Nick Drochak <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* CryptoConvert.cs: Work around for mcs? bug 45127.

2003-03-07  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* ARC4Managed.cs: New. Implementation of the Alleged RC4(tm)
	stream cipher in managed code (required for SSL/TLS).
	* CryptoConvert.cs: New. Helper class to help convert between
	Windows crypto structures and .NET crypto classes (required
	for security tools).
	* MD2.cs: New. Abstract class for all MD2 hash implementations.
	* MD2Managed.cs: New. Managed implementation of the MD2 hash
	algorithm (required for old, but still valid, X.509 certificates).
	* RC4.cs: New. Abstract class for all RC4 stream cipher 
	implementations.
