	* Added partial implementation of SSL3 protocol ( not finished yet ).

	* TlsAbstractCipherSuite.cs: Renamed to CipherSuite.cs.

	* Removed AssemblyInfo.cs file.

2003-10-21 Carlos Guzmán Álvarez <carlosga@telefonica.net>

	TlsCipherSuiteFactory.cs: Changed names of private methods.

	TlsSslCipherSuite.cs: Replaced implementations of key generation methods with a throw new NotSupportedException().


2003-10-20  Carlos Guzmán Álvarez  <carlosga@telefonica.net>

	TlsCupherSuite.cs: Fixed padding length calculation on record encryption.
	
	TlsSessionContext.cs: 	Added new CompressionMethod property.
					Added new MAX_FRAGMENT_SIZE constant.

	TlsSession.cs: Removed MaxFragmentSize property.

	TlsSocket.cs: Replaced use of TlsSesison.MaxFragmentSize by TlsSessionContext.MAX_FAGMENT_SIZE
	
	TlsSessionSettings.cs: Added new CompressionMethod property.

	* Abstracted CipherSuite classes for allow work with other protocol versions.

	* Added new files :

		TlsAbstractCipherSuite.cs 
			
		TlsSslCipherSuite.cs

		TlsCipherSuiteFactory.cs

		TlsCompressionMethod.cs

	* Added new cipher suites definitions based on RFC3268 - (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3268.txt)

	* Added two new supported ciphersuites for TLS protocol:

		TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA

		TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA

	* Moved key generation stuff to specific cipher suite classes.

	* AssemblyInfo.cs: commented out KeyFile reference.

	* TlsSession.cs: changed Math.Pow for System.Math.Pow because of MCS
	bug with namespace resolving.
