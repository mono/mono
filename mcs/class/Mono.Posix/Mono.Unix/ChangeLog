2005-05-18  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* make-map.cs: Add a MphPrototypeFileGenerator, which looks for DllImport
	  methods across all types and generates a C header file declaration for
	  those methods.  This allows us to ensure consistency between
	  Mono.Posix.dll and MonoPosixHelper.so.  Rename WrapperFileGenerator to
		ConvertFileGenerator (it generates UnixConvert).
	* MapAttribute.cs, IncludeAttribute.cs: Make these internal -- there's no
	  reason for external users to even know these exist.
	* StdioFileStream.cs: Move GC.SuppressFinalize call to be last Dispose()
	  call.  This follows current design guidelines, and allows an exception to
	  be thrown from Dispose() without un-registering the finalizer.
	* Syscall.cs: Change method declarations to match MonoPosixHelper, etc.
	   - posix_fallocate(P) takes a size_t
	   - mis-spelled settimeofday(2), sethostname(2)
	   - exec(2) can be public; it's safe to call
	   - change lseek(2) so int's are passed to MonoPosixHelper.so, not shorts
	   - We can't allow two incompatible prototypes to exist (since C allows
	     only one prototype, and we're cross-checking prototypes now).  Change
	     utime(2) so only one prototype is needed.
	* UnixMarshal.cs: ErrorMarshal.ErrorTranslator and ErrorMarshal.Translate
	  shouldn't be public; make them internal.
	* UnixStream.cs: Remove `unsafe` code block when a "safe" alternative works;
	  Close() should also call GC.SuppressFinalize.

2005-05-12  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Syscall.cs: The Statvfs structure should contain a MountFlags enumeration,
	  not a ulong (we can "safely" do this since POSIX defines some values for
	  f_flag, so we should be kind and expose them).
	* UnixConvert.cs: Add MountFlags conversion functions.

2005-05-02  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

	* UnixListener.cs (Init): Remove the call to Cleanup() and the
	method itself, which was not supposed to be here.  We try to
	connect to the socket if it exists instead of deleting it
	undconditionally.

2005-04-30  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@ximian.com>

	* Stdlib.cs: Comment out usage of `UnmanagedFunctionPointer'. It
	isn't supported in the runtime -- it throws an assert -- so better
	not to use it at all for now.

2005-04-29  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* UnixConvert.cs: Fix time_t -> DateTime conversions.  time_t should be
	  assumed to be in the local time zone, so don't mess with UTC shifts.
	  This allows Mono.Unix to produce sane output (e.g. identical to ls(1) or
	  stat(1), instead of several hours different).

2005-04-29  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Stdlib.cs: Make FilePosition slightly more useful by providing a
	  ToString() override which dumps the fpos_t structure contents into a 
	  hex string.  Add Equals(), GetHashCode(), operator==, and operator!=
	  so FilePosition behaves like a value type.

2005-04-21 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* UnixClient.cs:
	* UnixListener.cs: TcpListener/TcpClient clones from Jow Shaw.

2005-04-21 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Mono.Posix.dll.sources: added UnixListener and UnixClient from Joe
	Shaw.

2005-04-21 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* UnixEndPoint.cs: fix from Mono.Posix.

2005-04-20  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Syscall.cs: Make all fork(2) and exec(2) functions `private`.  It
	  currently isn't safe to call these under *any* circumstances.  See also
	  68141, and this pertinent quote from Butenhof's 
	  "Programming with POSIX Threads", p197, s6.1:
	  
	      "When a threaded process calls fork to create a child process,
	      Pthreads specifies that only the thread calling fork exists in the
	      child. ... Pthreads does not 'terminate' the other threads in a forked
	      process...They simply cease to exist.  ... This is not a problem if
	      the child process is about to call exec to run a new program, but if
	      you use fork to clone a threaded program, beware that you may lose
	      access to memory, especially heap memory stored only as
	      thread-specific data values."
	  
	  Since P/Invoke currently requires using thread local storage, once you
	  fork(2) you won't be able to invoke exec(2) from managed code (since that
	  would require a P/Invoke transition to call exec(2), which would require
	  TLS, which doesn't exist in the new process).
	 
	  This can only be fixed by removing the TLS dependency on P/Invoke, which
	  isn't a priority (and may not be possible).
	 
	  The workaround is to create a C function which does your fork(2)/exec(2)
	  (and any other functions such as daemon(3)) on your behalf, and P/Invoke
	  to call this C function.

2005-04-18  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Syscall.cs: Update comment specifying which functions belong in Syscall.
	* UnixConvert.cs: Add XattrFlags conversion functions.
	* UnixMarshal.cs: Remove warning about self-assignment.

2005-04-16  Daniel Drake <dsd@gentoo.org>

	* Syscall.cs: Add bindings for extended attribute manipulation

2005-04-05  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Syscall.cs: Set entry point for sys_syslog to be syslog.
	Include the syslog.h header in the generated map so that we
	actually do the mapping.

2005-03-28  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* UnixConvert.cs: Add ToFopenMode() methods, which convert FileMode/FileAccess
	  into an fopen(3) mode string.  ToOpenFlags() should throw
	  ArgumentOutOfRangeException for argument violations.
	* StdioFileStream.cs: Add constructor overloads accepting filename and
	  FileMode/FileAccess overloads; Compatibility fixes with regression tests;
	  remove IDisposable implementation since System.IO.Stream already
	  implements it (which calls Close() for us).

2005-03-17  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Stdlib.cs: Move Errno-related functionality into Stdlib from Syscall,
	  since (1) errno is part of C89, and (2) StdioFileStream will need it, and
	  StdioFileStream shouldn't use Syscall.  Add [UnmanagedFunctionPointer]
		attribute to SignalHandler for .NET 2.0 (since signal handlers use C
		calling convention, not Stdcall).
	* Syscall.cs: Move Errno-related functionality into Stdlib.
	* UnixMarshal.cs: Use ERANGE not EPERM when figuring out appropriate
	  translator, since ERANGE is part of C99 and EPERM isn't.  Use Stdlib
	  instead of Syscall for Errno-related functionality.

2005-02-02  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* UnixFile.cs: Cope with changes in UnixStream.
	* UnixStream.cs: Change FileDescriptor property to Handle for consistency.
	* StdioFileStream.cs: Change FileStream property to Handle for consistency.

2005-02-02  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Syscall.cs: Remove public sys_ methods.  Some were public by mistake, and
	  others so that users could manually marshal strings if desired.  Manually
	  marshaling strings shouldn't be necessary, though, so remove them too.

2005-02-02  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* StdioFileStream.cs: Fix Length property to actually return the size of the
	  file, not the # of bytes from the current position to EOF.  Oops.

2005-01-31  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Stdlib.cs: Import "msvcrt", not "libc".  These members are part of the
	  ANSI C standard, and thus should be present on Windows via msvcrt.dll
	  (except snprintf, until they catch up to C99).  Change the calling
	  convention of all functions to Cdecl, as the .NET default is Stdcall.
	  Changing the calling convention isn't needed in Syscall, as it can only be
	  run on Unix platforms anyway, where the default is Cdecl.
	* Syscall.cs: Add LIBC member that points to the real "libc"; we can't use
	  the imported definition from Stdlib as "msvcrt" doesn't exist on Unix.

2005-01-29  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Stdlib.cs: sys_* functions shouldn't be public.

2005-01-13  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* make-map.cs: libMonoPosixHelper exports Mono_Posix prefixes, not Mono_Unix
	  prefixes, so change the type and namespace to generate compatible code.
	* Syscall.cs: Change OpenFlags values so they match the Linux values.

2005-01-13  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Stdlib.cs: Use Stdlib.LIBC instead of "libc".
	* StdioFileStream.cs: Add FilePosition property (not that I expect anyone to
	  use it) and Rewind() method.

2005-01-05  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* StdioFileStream.cs: Added; System.IO.Stream wrapper for C FILE struct.
	* Stdlib.cs: Correct visibility of ftell().

2005-01-05  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Stdlib.cs: Re-order declarations to match the order used in the 
	  C99 Standard Annex B; Complete <stdio.h> exports (except for those not
	  worth supporting); Add non-"unsafe" versions of fread(3), fwrite(3) and
	  add some rudimentary buffer-overflow checking; Add <stdlib.h> exports such
	  as getenv(3), exit(3), rand(3), EXIT_SUCCESS, RAND_MAX, etc.

2005-01-03  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Syscall.cs: Update endfsent() and setfsent() declarations, as these must
	  now be implemented in MonoPosixHelper.

2005-01-01  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Stdlib.cs, Syscall.cs: Minimize duplicate declarations of
	  "MonoPosixHelper" for use in DllImport statements.

2005-01-01  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Stdlib.cs: Don't use C# v2 features; fixes build under CSC.EXE.

2004-12-30  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Stdlib.cs: On miguel's suggestion, rename Sighandler_t to SignalHandler.

2004-12-30  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Stdlib.cs: Implement all C89 <stdio.h> functions except for the scanf(3)
	  family.  These are too dangerous to expose.

2004-12-30  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* CdeclFunctions.cs: Remove warning about unused variable.
	* Stdlib.cs: Make signal(2) sane and (hopefully) complete.
	* Syscall.cs: Fix cuserid Obsolete message to reference correct class name.
	* UnixProcess.cs: Remove warning about unused variable.
	* UnixMarshal.cs: Remove warnings about unused variables.

2004-12-29  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* UnixPath.cs: Add ReadSymbolicLink(), which takes an intelligent approach
	  to reading symlinks (since their contents may be any size, we grow the
	  buffer dynamically to fit them all, instead of assuming a maximum size).
	* UnixSymbolicLinkInfo.cs: Remove MaxContentsSize.

2004-12-29  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* UnixPath.cs: Add check for when symlink points to a full path name.

2004-12-29  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Syscall.cs: Fix Object.Equals implementations.
	* UnixPath.cs: New & improved, with Testing!  GetRealPath() is changed so
	  that it doesn't walk the entire path looking for symlinks, it just reads 
	  the leaf.  GetCompletRealPath() walks the entire path resolving symlinks.
	  GetCanonicalPath() added, which "cleans up" a path (removing extraneous
	  "." and ".." entries).
	* UnixSymbolicLinkInfo.cs: Rename ContentsLength -> MaxContentsSize.

2004-12-28  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* UnixFileSystemInfo.cs: Add a link(2) wrapper, CreateLink().  Strictly
	  speaking it's only "safe" to do this on files, but an exception will be 
	  returned if the user tries to hard link directories (because of EPERM), 
	  unless the user is root, in which case it should be allowed anyway...

2004-12-28  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* CdeclFunctions.cs: Correct the comments for AMD64
	* UnixDirectoryInfo.cs: override Name; add Parent & Root properties; 
	  Correct Path usage (s/Path/FullPath/g).
	* UnixDriveInfo.cs: Added.  Based on .NET 2.0 System.IO.DriveInfo docs,
	  provides statvfs(2) and getfsfile(3) information about a mounted volume.
	  GetDrives() wraps getfsent(3), thus parsing /etc/fstab.
	* UnixFile.cs: Use UnixConver.ToOpenFlags, deleting the local version.
	* UnixFileInfo.cs: Use UnixConver.ToOpenFlags, deleting the local version;
	  override Name; add DirectoryName and Directory properties; 
	* UnixFileSystemInfo.cs: Make more .NET-like, using FullPath and
	  OriginalPath protected members, abstract Name property; Add
	  CreateSymbolicLink; Remove ReadLink (it's now 
	  UnixSymbolicLinkInfo.Contents); Use lstat(2) for Create(string), so we
	  properly detect Symbolic Links.
	* UnixPath.cs: Added; Path manipulation utility functions.
	* UnixSymbolicLinkInfo.cs: 
	  - Seal the class; 
	  - override new abstract member Name; 
	  - rename ReadLink to ContentsPath (and Contents) properties 
	    (why "Contents"?  Because readlink(2) says "readlink places the 
	    contents of the symbolic link in the buffer...")
	  - Add CreateSymbolicLinkTo(), which creates a symlink to the specified
	    "normal" file

2004-12-28  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Stdlib.cs: Add syslog(3) to XPrintfFunctions; Add additional printf(3) 
	  and fprintf(3) overload which properly escape the format string 
	  (by using "%s" as the format for the user-supplied message).
	* Syscall.cs: Add #regions for enummerations, structures, classes; Wrap
	  syslog(3) and related enumerations; fix operator!= on Dirent, Group; 
	  wrap {f}statvfs(2); wrap <fstab.h> entries (getfsent(3), etc.).
	* UnixConvert.cs: Add Syslog-releated enumeration translation functions;
	  Move ToOpenFlags here from UnixFile and UnixFileInfo.
	* UnixMarshal.cs: Missing P/Invoke methods throw
	  EntryPointNotFoundException, not MissingMethodException; add
	  EscapeFormatString, which escapes printf-style format strings so that they
	  can be safely handed off to native code (avoiding stack overflow, etc);
	  make CreateExceptionForError internal.

2004-12-15  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Stdlib.cs: Add more <stdio.h> wrappers, such as fread(3) and fwrite(3).
	  These will be useful in implementing System.IO.Stream subclass for
	  reading/writing to a FILE*.  Fix a typo in the realloc(3) DllImport.
	* Syscall.cs: Fix the sys_kill and sys_crypt declarations.
	* CdeclFunction.cs: Document calling convention problems on AMD64.

2004-11-18  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* CdeclFunction.cs: Added.
	* Stdlib.cs: Re-add printf(3) and fprintf(3).  They may not be portable (the
	  jury is still out on that; the AMD64 SysV ABI looks like it should be
	  portable to AMD64 to my eyes), but they will work on *some* platforms, so
	  we should permit it.  The new implementation takes a page out of
	  cocoa-sharp: use System.Reflection.Emit to generate a P/Invoke method at
	  runtime to invoke printf(3) or fprintf(3).  This way, we can export a
	  params signature to C# code, permitting natural usage such as:
	      Stdlib.printf ("Hello, %s world! (%i)\n", "silly", 42);
	* Syscall.cs: Mark which headers are complete, which functions still need
	  wrapping (for headers which have anything done to them), add #region
	  blocks for each header;
	  export mkfifo(3), fexecve(), getppid(2), setlogin(); fix sleep(3) export.
	* UnixEnvironment.cs: Export a friendly getppid(2) wrapper.
	  GetParentProcessId isn't in UnixProcess as there's no way (that I know of)
	  to get the Parent's Parent, so it can't be a class member, and exposing it
	  as a static member of UnixProcess doesn't make sense to me, as it isn't
	  general.  Added GetUserShells().
	* UnixProcess.cs: Change constructor to internal, so it can be used from
	  UnixEnvironment.

2004-11-16  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Stdlib.cs: Remove printf(3) and fprintf(3).  These are vararg/CDECL 
	  functions, and it's not portable to call them in this manner.
	  (It's not portable because some architectures, such as AMD64, use a
	  "cookie" as part of the vararg calling sequence to help reduce buffer
	  overflow exploits.  Trying to call vararg functions as if they were an
	  overloaded function will not properly set this hardware cookie, resulting
	  in a hardware exception.  Talk to lupus for more information.)

2004-11-16  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Syscall.cs, UnixConvert.cs: Remove mount- and umount-related
	  functionality.  Mount/umount is inherently non-portable (see the C code
	  for mount/umount), and trying to provide a consistent interface is
	  impossible.  If you need mount/umount support, use the command-line
	  programs mount(1) and umount(1).

2004-11-16  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	+ Lots o' Renames, as the namespace changed.
	* PosixConvert.cs: Moved to UnixConvert.cs:
	* PosixDirectory.cs: Moved to UnixDirectory.cs:

	* PosixUser.cs: Moved to UnixUser.cs:
	* PosixUserInfo.cs: Moved to UnixUserInfo.cs:
	* Catalog.cs, IncludeAttribute.cs, MapAttribute.cs, PeerCred.cs, Stdlib.cs,
	  Syscall.cs, UnixConvert.cs, UnixDirectory.cs, UnixDirectoryInfo.cs,
	  UnixEndPoint.cs, UnixEnvironment.cs, UnixFile.cs, UnixFileInfo.cs,
	  UnixFileSystemInfo.cs, UnixGroup.cs, UnixGroupInfo.cs, UnixIOException.cs,
	  UnixMarshal.cs, UnixProcess.cs, UnixStream.cs, UnixSymbolicLinkInfo.cs,
	  UnixUser.cs, UnixUserInfo.cs: Deal with renamed classes/members.

2004-11-15  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* PosixUserInfo.cs: Make the PosixUserInfo(Passwd) constructor public;
	  override Object.GetHashCode and Object.Equals.
	* PosixGroupInfo.cs: Make the PosixGroupInfo(Group) constructor public;
	  override Object.GetHashCode and Object.Equals.
	* PosixIOException.cs: Use PosixMarshal.GetErrorDescription instead of
	  calling Syscall.strerror_r directly
	* PosixMarshal.cs: Add GetErrorDescription.  Strerror_r() isn't portable, so
	  GetErrorDescription() first tries strerror_r(), and if it fails falls back
	  to strerror(3).
	* Syscall.cs: 
	  - Seal the Dirent class.  It has no virtual members, so there's no point 
      in it being non-sealed.  Override Object.GetHashCode and Object.Equals.
	  - Seal the Group class.  It has no virtual members, so there's no point 
      in it being non-sealed.  Override Object.GetHashCode and Object.Equals.
	    Provide operator== and operator!=.
	  - Seal the Passwd class.  It has no virtual members, so there's no point 
      in it being non-sealed.  Override Object.GetHashCode and Object.Equals.
	    Provide operator== and operator!=.
	  - Remove strerror_r() convenience overload.  This is now
	    PosixMarshal.GetErrorDescription().

2004-11-12  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Syscall.cs: Export time-related functions (gettimeofday, settimeofday,
	  utime, utimes), mknod.

2004-11-07  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* PosixEnvironment.cs : csc build fix. see bug #69195.
	* PosixStream.cs : csc build fix. see bug #69196.

2004-11-05  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* PosixConvert.cs: New file; conversion functions for Mono.Posix types.
	* PosixDirectory.cs: New file; Friendly wrapper over directory information.
	* PosixDirectoryInfo.cs: New file; Friendly wrapper over directory information.
	* PosixEnvironment.cs: New file; Friendly wrapper over environment information.
	* PosixFile.cs: New file; Friendly wrapper over file information.
	* PosixFileInfo.cs: New file; Friendly wrapper over file information.
	* PosixFileSystemInfo.cs: New file; Friendly wrapper over `stat'.
	* PosixGroup.cs: New file; User Group-related functionality
	* PosixGroupInfo.cs: New file; User Group-related functionality
	* PosixIOException.cs: New file; Exception for POSIX-generated exceptions.
	* PosixMarshal.cs: New file; utility functions for marshaling, etc.
	* PosixProcess.cs: New file; Friendly wrapper over process information.
	* PosixStream.cs: New file; Friendly wrapper over file descriptors.
	* PosixSymbolicLinkInfo.cs: New file; Friendly wrapper over symbolic links.
	* PosixUser.cs: New file; Friendly wrapper over user information.
	* PosixUserInfo.cs: New file; Friendly wrapper over user information.
	* Stdlib.cs: New file; C standard library exports.
	* Syscall.cs: Effective re-write.  
	  - Organize exports by header file
	  - add additional enumerations (Error for the E* error values, etc.)
	  - always explicitly specify enumeration underlying type
	  - Use a new wrapping infrastructure so that ABI-stable types are exported
	  	- For example, size_t is exported as ulong, not IntPtr.
	  - Wrap more functions, and wrap them better (such as getpwnam).
	  - This release is NOT backward compatible.  Many names are the same, and
	    hopefully they're still compatible, but no effort was made to maintain
	    compatibility.  For example, FileMode was removed and replaced with
	    FilePermissions, to avoid a name conflict with System.IO.FileMode.
		- Change umount() to use MonoPosixHelper: portability fix for Mac OS X.
	* make-map.cs: Another effective re-write, to clean up the code, produce
	  better output, and produce more output.  For example, most of
	  PosixConvert can be auto-generated, so it is (modulo version delays and
	  bootstrap issues).  `map.c' is now conditional on all macros, and has
	  error checking for invalid/unsupported values.

2004-09-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Syscall.cs: Add support for poll ().

2004-09-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* make-map.cs: Use field value not name for #defines.
		
2004-09-14  Loren Bandiera <lorenb@mmgsecurity.com>

	* Syscall.cs: Added method for getpwnam which uses Passwd
	struct.
	* macros.c: Helper function for getpwnam
	(In committing, Josh Tauberer also added getpwuid.)

2004-07-09  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* PeerCred.cs: Get the unix socket peer credentials.

2004-05-26  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* Syscall.cs: Do not let the runtime handle strings, as we do not
	own those strings, we must transform the char * into a string
	ourselves. 

2004-05-03  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* Syscall.cs: Add symlink

2004-04-19  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* Syscall.cs: Use hex values for FileMode, since C# does not have
	an octal integer mode.

2004-03-30  Joshua Tauberer <tauberer@for.net>

	* Added readlink, strerror, opendir, readdir, closedir
	* Added Mono.Posix.Stat.UnixToDateTime(long unixtime) --> DateTime

2004-03-11  Joshua Tauberer <tauberer@for.net>

	* Syscall.cs: Removed argument to getgid that shouldn't be there.
		Added getusername, getgroupname which wrap getpwuid, getgrgid
		without dealing with pointers to structures.
		Removed duplicate FileMode enum nested in Syscall class.
		Added stat and lstat, which use StatMode enumeration
		(like FileMode but nicer and complete) and Stat struct.
	* macros.c: Helper functions for getpwuid, getgrgid, stat, lstat.

2004-01-07  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Syscall.cs: moved the assembly attribute to a proper place
	and added 'signal.h'
	* make-map.cs: use reflection to invoke the properties, as it
	fails under MS runtime.
	

2004-01-05  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Syscall.cs: moved assembly attribute and added unsafe block to fix
	the build on windows.

2003-11-11  Wojciech Polak <polak@gnu.org

	* Syscall.cs: Applied patch from Wojciech Polak <polak@gnu.org> to
	support IsAtty.

2003-05-16  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* UnixEndPoint.cs: New property to get and set the filename, like
