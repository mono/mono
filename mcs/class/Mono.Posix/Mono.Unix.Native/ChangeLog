	* Stdlib.cs: s/ACCES/ACCESS/g.  How'd I create a badly named errno value?

2005-12-29  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* make-map.cs: Properly handle managed arrays in argument lists.
	* Syscall.cs: Properly bind utimes(2) (the Linux man pages are vague on what
	  it does; the BSD ones are much better).  Bind lutimes(2) and futimes(2).

2005-12-27  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Syscall.cs: Include <sys/mman.h> for map.c generation.  Fixes #77091.

2005-12-27  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* make-map.cs: Always include 2nd parameter of [Obsolete] attributes; mark
	  the [DllImport]ed method with [Obsolete] if the underlying type is
	  [Obsolete].
	* NativeConvert.generated.cs: Flush.

2005-12-27  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* FileNameMarshaler.cs: Use UnixMarshal.PtrToStringUnix -- it's faster.

2005-11-28  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Stdlib.cs: Prelink all SignalHandlers passed to Stdlib.signal().  This is
	  so that mono doesn't have to JIT the handler within signal context.

2005-11-08  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Stdlib.cs: Implement IEquatable<FilePosition> for FilePosition.
	* Syscall.cs: Provide GetHashCode(), Equals(), operator==, operator!= for
	  all structure types.  Implement IEquatable<T> for all "value type" 
	  structs and classes.

2005-11-07  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Syscall.cs: *xattr functions should use the FileNameMarshaler for filenames.

2005-11-07  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* make-map.cs: Always use ordinal string sorting behavior.  The string
	  collation sorting has changed, so to keep the mono/support diff sizes down
	  we have to explicitly specify the previous implicit ordering.

2005-11-02  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Syscall.cs: Remove [CLSCompliant(false)] when it isn't needed.

2005-11-02  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* FileNameMarshaler.cs: Use UnixMarshal.FreeHeap().  .Free() is obsolete.

2005-10-27  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Stdlib.cs: Correct return type of setbuf(IntPtr, byte*).
	* Syscall.cs: Remove [Obsolete] SyslogFacility.LOG_USRE member
	  (Mono.Unix.Native hasn't shipped yet, so nobody is using it); correct
	  [Obsolete] comment for getpagesize().

2005-10-26  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* FileNameMarshaler.cs: Deal with UnixMarshal method name changes.

2005-10-26  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Stdlib.cs: FilePosition should derive from MarshalByRefObject, for two
	  reasons: (1) it's a recommendation from FxCop that classes implementing
	  IDisposable also derive from MarshalByRefObject; (2) FilePosition is
	  exposed from Mono.Unix.StdioFileStream, which (indirectly) inherits from
	  MarshalByRefObject.  Fix Equals() so it doesn't rely on Reflection.

2005-10-25  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* FileNameMarshaler.cs: Custom marshaler to marshal filenames using
	  Mono.Unix.UnixEncoding.  A custom marshaler is used to remove the need to
	  have ~6 lines of boilerplate on every method that takes filenames.
	* Stdlib.cs, Syscall.cs:  Filenames need to be marshaled through the
	  FileNameMarshaler, which will encode/decode filenames with UnixEncoder.

2005-10-14  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Stdlib.cs, Syscall.cs: Flush naming convention documentation.

2005-10-14  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* NativeConvert.generated.cs: Flush currently generated version.

2005-10-14  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* make-map.cs: Fix documentation comment.
	* Stdlib.cs: Fix export of XprintfFunctions.syslog(); make SetLastError()
	  protected (normal user code shouldn't call it, as it isn't safe); 
	  replace functions which return `void' with functions which return `int'
	  (adding them to MonoPosixHelper.so as well) -- since users can't reliably
	  use SetLastError(), they need the "normal" error detection mechanism;
	  correct the strlen(3) export.
	* Syscall.cs: 
	  - s/PathConf/PathconfName/, s/SysConf/SysconfName/, s/ConfStr/ConfstrName/ 
	    to follow documented enumeration naming conventions.
	  - replace functions which return `void' with functions which return `int'
	    (adding them to MonoPosixHelper.so as well) -- since users can't reliably
	    use SetLastError(), they need the "normal" error detection mechanism;

2005-10-13 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Stdlib.cs: add strlen() to fix the build.

2005-09-23  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* make-map.cs: Generate NativeConvert documentation XML fragments for use in
	  monodoc.

2005-09-20  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* ChangeLog: Started.
	* CdeclFunction.cs: Copied from ../Mono.Unix; change namespace.
	* HeaderAttribute.cs: Added
	* make-map.cs: Copied from ../Mono.Unix; sort type and member names in
	  output (makes for a more stable svn history, as types/members won't change
	  position anymore within generated code); look for HeaderAttribute not
	  IncludeAttribute for getting headers & #defines; generate NativeConvert
	  partial class.
	* NativeConvert.cs: Copied from ../Mono.Unix; change namespace; turn into a
	  partial class; Remove generated code (generated code is in
	  NativeConvert.generated.cs).
	* NativeConvert.generated.cs: Added
	* Stdlib.cs: Copied from ../Mono.Unix; change namespace; rename Error to
	  Errno (as Error is a "reserved word" in FxCop); [CLSCompliant(false)]
	  support.
	* Syscall.cs: Use HeaderAttribute, not IncludeAttribute, for CLS compliance; 
	  add [CLSCompliant(false)] as needed; use NativeConvert, not UnixConvert.
