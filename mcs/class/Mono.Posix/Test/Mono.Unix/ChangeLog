	* UnixGroupTest.cs: The type of UnixGroupInfo.GroupId changed.  UnixGroup is
	  deprecated; use UnixGroupInfo instead.
	* UnixUserTest.cs: The type of UnixUserInfo.UserId changed.  UnixUser if
	  deprecated; use UnixUserInfo instead.

2005-10-26  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* UnixMarshalTest.cs: s/StringToAlloc/StringToHeap/g (UnixMarshal change).
	* UnixEncodingTest.cs: Deal with UnixEncoding.EscapeByte value change.

2005-10-25  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* UnixEncodingTest.cs: Added string/byte[] encoding tests for
	  Mono.Unix.UnixEncoding.

2005-10-17  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* UnixMarshalTest.cs: Added string marshaling tests for Mono.Unix.UnixMarshal.

2005-06-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* StdioFileStreamTest.cs: comment out tests that depend on the
	underlying Stdio implementation.

2005-05-21  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@ximian.com>

	* UnixUserTest.cs, UnixGroupTest.cs: Disable tests that might not
	work on a Solaris box with NIS. Bug #72293.

2005-04-29  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* StdioFileStreamTest.cs: Add FilePosition tests; remove `var = var` 
	  lines (added to remove warnings, but now produces other warnings).

2005-04-28  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* StdlibTest.cs: Calling a P/Invoke function from signal-handler context is
	  *bad*, which is why I've had so much trouble getting consistent results
	  getting this test to work -- it was broken by design.  Instead, just save
	  the signum passed to the handler (which is reentrant safe), and compare
	  the saved value with the expected value after the signal handler returns.
	  This should always work.  Use SIGURG instead of SIGUSR1 because SIGURG is
	  ignored by default (allowing us to call it without adding your own
	  handler), unlike SIGUSR1 which terminates the program.

2005-03-28  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* StdioFileStreamTest.cs: Added; based on MonoTests.System.IO.FileStreamTest.

2005-02-09  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* StdlibTest.cs: Signal is currently ignored, but add Category(NotDotNet) so
	  it isn't run even when we fix it.  .NET 1.1 doesn't marshal delegates
	  properly for signal (different calling conventions).
	  Add Category(NotDotNet) for Snprintf(), as MSVCRT.dll doesn't export it.
	* UnixGroupTest.cs, UnixUserTest.cs: Don't run these under .NET, as Windows
	  doesn't support the Syscall and related classes.

2005-02-01  Raja R Harinath  <rharinath@novell.com>

	* UnixUserTest.cs (UnixUserTest.ReentrantConstructors): Don't
	assume userid<->username mapping is a bijection.
	(UnixUserTest.NonReentrantSyscalls): Likewise.

2005-01-20  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* StdlibTest.cs: Ignore the signal(3) test, as it's currently hanging Mono.

2005-01-13  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* StdlibTest.cs: Added tests for signal(3) and snprintf(3).

2005-01-05  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* ChangeLog: Started.
	* UnixGroupTest.cs, UnixUserTest.cs: Added.
