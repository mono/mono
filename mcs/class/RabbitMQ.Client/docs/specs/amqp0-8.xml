JPMorgan Chase Bank & Co., Cisco Systems, Inc., Envoy Technologies Inc., iMatix

29West Inc. (collectively, the "Authors") each hereby grants to you a worldwide,
perpetual, royalty-free, nontransferable, nonexclusive license to
(i) copy, display, and implement the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol
("AMQP") Specification and (ii) the Licensed Claims that are held by
the Authors, all for the purpose of implementing the Advanced Messaging
Queue Protocol Specification. Your license and any rights under this
Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from
any Author if you bring any claim, suit, demand, or action related to
the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification against any Author.
Upon termination, you shall destroy all copies of the Advanced Messaging
Queue Protocol Specification in your possession or control.

As used hereunder, "Licensed Claims" means those claims of a patent or
patent application, throughout the world, excluding design patents and
design registrations, owned or controlled, or that can be sublicensed
without fee and in compliance with the requirements of this
Agreement, by an Author or its affiliates now or at any
future time and which would necessarily be infringed by implementation
of the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification. A claim is
necessarily infringed hereunder only when it is not possible to avoid
infringing it because there is no plausible non-infringing alternative
for implementing the required portions of the Advanced Messaging Queue
Protocol Specification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensed Claims
shall not include any claims other than as set forth above even if
contained in the same patent as Licensed Claims; or that read solely
on any implementations of any portion of the Advanced Messaging Queue
Protocol Specification that are not required by the Advanced Messaging
Queue Protocol Specification, or that, if licensed, would require a
payment of royalties by the licensor to unaffiliated third parties.
Moreover, Licensed Claims shall not include (i) any enabling technologies
that may be necessary to make or use any Licensed Product but are not
themselves expressly set forth in the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol
Specification (e.g., semiconductor manufacturing technology, compiler
technology, object oriented technology, networking technology, operating
system technology, and the like); or (ii) the implementation of other
published standards developed elsewhere and merely referred to in the
body of the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification, or
(iii) any Licensed Product and any combinations thereof the purpose or
function of which is not required for compliance with the Advanced
Messaging Queue Protocol Specification. For purposes of this definition,
the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification shall be deemed to
include both architectural and interconnection requirements essential
for interoperability and may also include supporting source code artifacts
where such architectural, interconnection requirements and source code
artifacts are expressly identified as being required or documentation to
achieve compliance with the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification.

As used hereunder, "Licensed Products" means only those specific portions
of products (hardware, software or combinations thereof) that implement
and are compliant with all relevant portions of the Advanced Messaging
Queue Protocol Specification.

The following disclaimers, which you hereby also acknowledge as to any
use you may make of the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification:

THE ADVANCED MESSAGING QUEUE PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS,"

THE AUTHORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY

  The file class provides methods that support reliable file transfer.
  File messages have a specific set of properties that are required for
  interoperability with file transfer applications. File messages and

  compatible with the staging model.  Applications that need browsable

  work with streaming content

<doc>
  The stream class provides methods that support multimedia streaming.
  The stream class uses the following semantics: one message is one
  packet of data; delivery is unacknowleged and unreliable; the consumer
  can specify quality of service parameters that the server can try to
  adhere to; lower-priority messages may be discarded in favour of high
  priority messages.
