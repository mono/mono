SqlExpress_MDF_File_Auto_Creation_MiscSectionTitle=SQLExpress database file auto-creation error
SqlExpress_MDF_File_Auto_Creation=The connection string specifies a local Sql Server Express instance using a database location within the application's App_Data directory.  The provider attempted to automatically create the application services database because the provider determined that the database does not exist. The following configuration requirements are necessary to successfully check for existence of the application services database and automatically create the application services database:
SqlExpress_MDF_File_Auto_Creation_1=If the application is running on either Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008R2, special configuration steps are necessary to enable automatic creation of the provider database.  Additional information is available at:  http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=160102. If the application's App_Data directory does not already exist, the web server account must have read and write access to the application's directory.  This is necessary because the web server account will automatically create the App_Data directory if it does not already exist.
SqlExpress_MDF_File_Auto_Creation_2=If the application's App_Data directory already exists, the web server account only requires read and write access to the application's App_Data directory.  This is necessary because the web server account will attempt to verify that the Sql Server Express database already exists within the application's App_Data directory.  Revoking read access on the App_Data directory from the web server account will prevent the provider from correctly determining if the Sql Server Express database already exists.  This will cause an error when the provider attempts to create a duplicate of an already existing database.  Write access is required because the web server account's credentials are used when creating the new database.
SqlExpress_MDF_File_Auto_Creation_3=Sql Server Express must be installed on the machine.
SqlExpress_MDF_File_Auto_Creation_4=The process identity for the web server account must have a local user profile.  See the readme document for details on how to create a local user profile for both machine and domain accounts.
SqlExpress_file_not_found_in_connection_string=SQL Express filename was not found in the connection string.
SqlExpress_file_not_found=The SQL Express filename specified was not found.

Src_not_available=The source code that generated this unhandled exception can only be shown when compiled in debug mode. To enable this, please follow one of the below steps, then request the URL:\r\n\r\n1. Add a "Debug=true" directive at the top of the file that generated the error. Example:\r\n\r\n{0}   <%@ Page Language="C#" Debug="true" %>{1}\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\n2) Add the following section to the configuration file of your application:\r\n\r\n{2}<configuration>\r\n    <system.web>\r\n        <compilation debug="true"/>\r\n    </system.web>\r\n</configuration>{3}\r\n\r\n Note that this second technique will cause all files within a given application to be compiled in debug mode. The first technique will cause only that particular file to be compiled in debug mode.\r\n\r\nImportant: Running applications in debug mode does incur a memory/performance overhead. You should make sure that an application has debugging disabled before deploying into production scenario.
