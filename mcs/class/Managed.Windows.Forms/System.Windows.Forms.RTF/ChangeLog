	* KeysInit.cs:
	* Minor.cs: 
	* RTF.cs: Add support for parsing pngblip data.  These are hex
	encoded strings that represent a PNG image.

	* RTF.cs: more warning fixes.

2006-12-04  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* RTF.cs: remove unused fields.

	* Style.cs: remove unused field.

	* Charset.cs: remove unused field.

	* TextMap.cs: Since we map udieresis as a standard char we need to
	have a text mapping for it.  At some point I should go through all
	the standard chars and make sure we have mappings for them.
	* Major.cs:
	* Minor.cs: Make debugging a more beautiful experience.

2006-10-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* RTF.cs: Kick out of the text swallowing loop if we begin a new
	group, this happens when there is an alternate font name.  TODO:
	We should probably handle alternate font names somehow.
	- Skip over all OptDest tags, these are 'new' RTF features that we
	don't need to handle
	* KeysInit.cs: Make OptDest a destination, since that's what it
	is.

	* RTF.cs: Need to cast this to a char now.

2006-10-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* RTF.cs: When reading in chars use an int so that we can
	correctly detect EOF.

	* Font.cs: Set a default emtpy name so we don't crash if an RTF 
	  document defines a font but no name for it

2006-04-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* RTF.cs: Skip \r and \n characters instead of passing them back up
	  to the parser. It will confuse the parser. (Fixes #77914)

2005-12-22  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* RTF.cs: Added method to allow setting the default font for the RTF
	  document. This font will be used if the document does not contain
	  a font table.
	* Font.cs: Added method to delete font with a given number; 
	  changed set_Num to call this method (to allow replacing fonts
	  with the same number, particulary the default font)
