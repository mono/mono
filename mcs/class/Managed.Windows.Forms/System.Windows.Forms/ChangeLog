	* DataGridViewCell.cs: Avoid a NRE in GetValue if the cell doesn't 
	have a DataGridView associated yet.
	[Fixes bug #600786]

2010-05-01  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolStripItemCollection.cs: When calling Clear set Owner and Parent
	properties to null for each of the items in the collection, just as
	Remove/RemoveAt do. Implement a ClearInternal method that clears the
	collection without modifying the mentioned properties.
	* ToolStrip.cs:
	* ToolStripOverflow.cs: Call ToolStripItemCollection.ClearInternal
	for our internal collections.
	This should fix #590100, which producing a race when the garbage
	collector was calling ToolStripItem.Dispose, which in turn was firing
	a Layout in the ToolStrip.

2010-04-27  Ivan Zlatev  <ivan@ivanz.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: Fix multiple issues when inserting and adding new 
	columns.

2010-04-27  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolStripSplitButton.cs:
	* ToolStripDropDownItem.cs:
	* ToolStripMenuItem.cs: Update overrides.
	* ToolStripItem.cs: Pass the number of clicks to HandleClick when
	firing OnMouseUp, so we can later fire either OnClick or
	OnDoubleClick.

	Fixes #558632.

2010-04-26  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: When emitting the complete RTF value escape chars
	above 0x80, at .Net seems to do. This way we are able to make
	round-trip assignations between the setter and getter of the
	RichTextBox.Rtf property.
	Fixes part of #586901.

2010-04-26  Ivan Zlatev  <ivan@ivanz.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: Handle all possible cases for when a new column is 
	added and there are existing rows with existing cells both in the 
	non-databound and the databound scenario.
	[Fixes bug #583387]

2010-04-26  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: When retrieving data from the x11 clipboard and we
	are using either XA_STRING or OEMTEXT try to detect if we have escaped
	unicode chars, and unescape them as needed. This us used by some
	(gnome) applications to pass unicode chars in a non-unicode context.
	Fixes #596402.

2010-04-25  Ivan Zlatev  <ivan@ivanz.com>

	* DataGridViewCellCollection.cs, DataGridView.cs: 
	Ensure column cell templates are properly applied.
	[Fixes bug #583404]

2010-04-24  Ivan Zlatev  <ivan@ivanz.com>

	* DataGridViewColumnCollection.cs: When adding a column also 
	set the DisplayIndex if its now set by the user already.
	[Fixes bug #583387]

2010-04-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* NotifyIcon.cs: Make BalloonWindow expose the owner's Handle.
	* Theme.cs:
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Add a HideBalloonWindow method to force to
	close an active balloon window.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: When removing from the system tray try to close
	the balloon window. This is important when we hide a NotifyIcon and
	thus need to close its related balloon window as well.
	Fixes bits of #590093.

2010-04-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: When adding a NotifyIcon to the system tray, mark its
	Hwnd.mapped as true, since its handle is going to be mapped later by
	the tray (not us), but we need to know it's alive and can later properly unmap
	it.
	Fixes part of #590093.

2010-04-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: When adding/inserting/setting a new node call
	TreeView.Sort if needed, and update/recalculate this entire
	collection in that case.
	* TreeView.cs: Make 'sorted' internal, instead of directly using
	Sorted, as this one could trigger a complete Sort() operation.

2010-04-14  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: We must use the comparer supplied by TreeViewNodeSorter
	*always*, since it is used recursively, so checking for a number of
	top level nodes is useless. This should fix a case where we were not
	sorting any node with a single root node.

2010-04-14  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: Call the base Paint impl last, instead of do that
	at the beginning, to let handlers draw on top of us. 
	Fixes the remaining bits of #587563.

2010-04-14  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: Separate the background rendering from the Paint
	routine, so we can both make sure the background stuff is done first,
	and we also let our items fire the OnPaint event handlers before or
	after their own routines.
	* ToolStripLabel.cs: Move the base call to OnPaint to the end, so any
	user's Paint handler can draw on top of us, like .Net does.
	Fixes #587563.

2010-04-13  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: When checking for the values returned by
	_NET_WORKAREA, use current_desktop+1 instead of current_desktop, since
	we need the actual value, instead of the index (which is 0 based, and
	is not working in this case). Patch by Andy Stühr
	(andysmuell@hammerhartes.de).
	Fixes #494234.

2010-04-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolTip.cs: Make TipState internal.
	* ToolStrip.cs: Use the same idea of ToolTip'state to have our
	internal timer close the tooltip window after a delay, instead of
	waiting for the mouse to move to a different item. Also, hide the
	tooltip window when the handle is destroyed, and also when the control
	is getting hidden.
	Fixes #581273.

2010-03-31  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Selection should be available after the first time the
	handle has been created, even if later the handle is destroyed or
	temporary invalidated.
	Fixes #584070.

2010-03-01  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: When receiving a double click on a node, toggle it only
	if it has one or more nodes - just as .net does.
	Fixes #578079.

2010-03-01  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* X11Keyboard.cs: Small correction for the previous patch: I forgot to
	take into account the case where the buffer used in XLookupString is
	not empty, but filled with garbage.

2010-03-01  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* X11Keyboard.cs: When handling the key events, sometimes calling
	either Xutf8LookupString or XLookupString with special chars (such
	backspace and enter) can result in a buffer filled with garbage, or
	empty - thus re-use the value returned by the same functions to fill
	the gap.
	Fixes #582691.

2010-02-25  Ivan Zlatev  <ivan@ivanz.com>

	* Control.cs: ControllCollaction IList implementation wasn't calling the 
	Add implementation causing ParentChanged and all sorts of other events not to 
	get fired.
	[Fixes bug #580042]

2010-02-25  Ivan Zlatev  <ivan@ivanz.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: If we are setting a new data source and it is 
	data bindable clear DataMember before binding.
	[Fixes bug #554296]

2010-02-25  Ivan Zlatev  <ivan@ivanz.com>

	* DataGridViewCheckBoxCell.cs: Toggle the checkbox on Space key press.
	[Fixes bug #574259]

2010-02-17  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: When retrieving SelectedRtf/Rtf properly escape any
	RTF reserved char, so we don't end up messing around the actual rtf
	values.
	Fixes part of #575731.

2010-02-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Line.cs: When setting the Text property, if the new text is larger
	than the previous one, call Grow to update our internal 'widths'
	array, to be properly in sync with the new text.
	Fixes #569530.

2010-02-10  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TabControl.cs: When calculating the layout for the tab pages, take
	into account the ImageList size info if it exists, even if it is
	empty.

2010-02-03  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* StatusStrip.cs:
	* XplatX11.cs:
	* X11Structs: Implement the new BeginMoveResize method, designed to
	instruct the window manager to init a resize operation on a top level
	form. This is used by StatusStrip.
	* XplatUI.cs:
	* XplatUIDriver.cs:
	* XplatUIWin32.cs:
	* XplatUICarbon.cs: Fill the gaps by creating stubs and updating the
	method calls.
	Fixes #573299.

2010-02-01  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: When creating DrawItemEventArgs pass the fore color and
	back color arguments depending on the higlight/focus state, just like
	.net.
	Fixes #572643.

2010-01-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: When the normal drop down window is closed, make sure
	that the auto complete list -if any- is closed as well, instead of
	stay open without need.

2010-01-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TextBox.cs: When showing the autocomplete listbox, make sure it's on
	top, by calling the raw XplatUI.SetZOrder for it, since we can't
	properly call BringToFront on it as it is parentless. This fixes an
	issue when using this feature with ComboBox's own parentless listbox.
	Fixes the remaining bits of #489339.

2010-01-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* XplatUI.cs:
	* XplatUIDriver:
	* XplatUICarbon:
	* XplatUIWin32:
	* XplatUIX11.cs: 
	* XplatUIStructs: Implement support for different kind of audible
	alerts in Windows, and update the requiered classes.
	* MessageBox.cs: 
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Update calls to XplatUI.AudibleAlert.
	Fixes #473725.

2010-01-18  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: When use manually setting DropDownHeight, ignore the
	MaxDropDownHeight property - also rename our field 'count' to
	'visible_items_count' to avoid confusion as much as possible.
	Fixes an issue with several items, showing an incorrect layout.

2010-01-18  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: SelectedText should set Modified to true. Observe
	that this is happening just here, not for the Text property, and
	neither for the TextBoxBase impl.
	Fixes #569950.

2010-01-10  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolStripMenuItem.cs: Put the Checked/CheckState logic in a single
	place and synchronize the events properly. Fixes a lack of
	coordination between the events - which should be fired together.

2010-01-09  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TrackBar.cs: Move our events code to a single method, allowing it to
	optionally fire the Scroll event. This way we both avoid the
	duplicated calls to OnScroll and also will be able to fire Scroll
	*before* OnValueChanged in other places.
	Fixes #568026.

2010-01-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* RadioButton.cs: When drawing, if Appearance is Button use the old
	normal routine in the theme engine, instead of using the one in 2.0,
	since this last one doesn't support proper rendering of the control as
	a button.
	Fixes #567904.

2010-01-03  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* GroupBoxRenderer.cs: Properly use SystemColors.GrayText to draw to
	text of the group box if it is disabled.
	Fixes #567847.

2009-12-15  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Control.cs: When changing the cursor and updating it, do update the
	cursor immediately even if there's a child control under the current
	cursor position - this is exactly what .net does.
	Fixes #555780.

2009-11-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: In OnLeave, do cancel or end current edit, depending on
	the commit_new_row value, instead of just trying to cancel if a new
	row had been added. This is important when modifying existing rows and
	then moving the focus out of the control.

2009-11-17  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* XplatUICarbon.cs: Implement the overriden AudibleAlert
	function in XplatUICarbon.  Currently it throws
	NotImplementedException which will kill a WinForms application showing
	a dialog box.
	Patch by  Erik Ylvisaker (erik@agatelib.org).

2009-11-17  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: In CurrentCell, the check to do nothing in case we are
	in the same cell as specified *and* not editing is wrong.

2009-11-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: When removing the cells, don't do anything if the
	specified row is the extra cell we use to add new ones.

2009-11-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: CurrentCell should be *used* if the new value is the
	same as the current one, since we could need to activate the edition
	in the current row. Also, when beginning the edition, do nothing if,
	basides having an empty source, we are sure we don't have the new
	cell, which could obviously start it.
	Fixes other bits of #323154.

2009-11-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: When we get notified by a change in the position of our
	data source, don't set CurrentRow if the source is empty, as there's
	no need to do anything else in the first place, and second, the logic
	in the CurrentRow setter (public property) will add a new row by
	default in this case (that is, when the source is empty).
	Fixes part of #323154.

2009-11-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolStripMenuItem.cs: Don't try to use SystemColors.MenuText if fore
	color is SystemColors.ControlText, as this system color detection
	should be done *completely*. This is specially important when
	detecting colors in systems running Gtk+ and dark themes.

2009-11-11  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: Add a new internal property to get the maximum possible
	visible rows in the grid. We cannot use VisibleRowCount since this
	value can, depending on the scroll position, return a +1 or -1 value,
	so we need an absolute way to know whether we need a scroll bar or
	not. Also, update VLargeChange to avoid code duplication.
	Fixes a vertical scroll mismatch happening trying to add a new row
	while the scrollbar has reached its maximum value.

2009-11-09  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs:
	* DataGrid.cs: Position the cursor in the add row should *not* show
	yet another new row - that will happen till we get any real input data
	from the user. When that happens, we will also mark the new row as
	ready to commit - otherwise, when the cursor moves to a different row,
	the just added row will be discarded. This is exactly what .Net seems
	to do.

2009-11-09  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: The large value for our vertical scrollbar should
	depend on the number of visible rows, instead of trying to re-use the
	value of VisibleRowCount, which is the value of *current* visible
	rows, and can easily end messed up if new rows are added/removed.

2009-11-09  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: When moving the scroll, *dont* ever end the current
	edit - this could seriously mess up our current edit cycle, specially
	when adding new rows.

2009-11-02  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TabControl.cs: In OnKeyDown call the base implementation first -
	this way we let the user tell us whether we should handle the key or
	not.
	Fixes #543717.

2009-11-02  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: Implement removal of rows the Correct Way by creating a
	copy of the indexes, as any direct write access to the source will cause to
	reset the entire selection - also, do the linear de-selection in
	reverse order to avoid any index mismatch in the source, due to out of
	synchronization removing the rows.

2009-11-02  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs:
	* DataGrid.cs: Don't use this add-pending behaviour to try to add a
	new row until we have the first input char - it was helping us to fix
	other issues we have/had, but it's not matching .net.

2009-10-30  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: When returning the preferred height, and we are
	supposed to be borderless, return the TopMargin value - usually in
	borderless mode it has a value of 0, but in the ToolStrip controls we
	need to set the margin manually.
	Fixes #551214.

2009-10-29  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolTip.cs: ShowAlways works at the form level, not at the control
	level. Fixes #544565.

2009-10-28  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ButtonBase.cs: Usually the click routines are handled in Control,
	but in this class we are handling it ourselved, thus we need to have
	the same calls, and we were missing the call to MouseClick.
	Patch by Eric Petit <surfzoid@gmail.com>.

2009-10-26  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: When setting Text and data source is being used, if the
	passed value is not matching any of the items in the source, don't
	pass it to GetItemText, since it's useless, as GetItemText expects a
	valid item.
	Fixes #546009.

2009-10-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When retrieving an item in virtual mode, as part of the
	process calculate its layout, instead of trying to do it later.
	* ListViewItem.cs: There's no need to try to infer whether we need to
	compute layout or not anymore - we just do it every time we are
	returning an item.
	This way we should be fixing View changes with cached items, which
	were storing the previous value, and not updating their contents
	properly.

2009-10-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ColumnHeader.cs: Remove the double linear search in the Index
	property, by removing the call to Contains, which is not needed.
	Also, Columns collection can never be null.

2009-10-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ColumnHeader.cs: When calculating the width and height of the
	column, try to expand to the right and use all the free space if we
	are the last column *and* the resize mode is set to -2/header content.
	Fixes #544716.

2009-10-14  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When retrieving the top item, take into account the
	offset represented by the header control, to retrieve the proper
	value. Patch by Christoph von Wittich (Christoph at ApiViewer.de)
	Fixes the remaining bits of #543773.

2009-10-14  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: TopItem setter should set the value as the top, not
	only ensuring its visibility.
	Fixes part of #543773.

2009-10-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: For virtual mode, when navigating the items using keyboard,
	don't use the matrix of positions, and instead calculate the positions
	based on the number of cols and rows, taking advantage of the fixed
	positions of items. Use the same idea to implement FirstVisibleIndex,
	so we avoid iterating over all the items. Patch by Stephen Robinson
	mono at esar.org.uk.
	Fixes part of #467418.

2009-10-12  Dick Porter  <dporter@codicesoftware.com>

	* Splitter.cs: Adjust offsets when more than one splitter is
	present in a control.  Fixes bug 509472.

2009-10-07  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When computing the value for groups height don't use
	text_size field, since in LargeIcon view it sometimes contains a
	double height value - use Font.Height directly, and also improve the
	padding value.
	* ThemeWin32Classic: The same as above.
	This way the space between the group header, the line, and the items
	area is not that big in LargeIcon view.

2009-10-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When retrieving the fixed positions for the items in
	virtual mode, use the row value to compute the coords of the item,
	instead of the col value, as opposed to SmallIcon/LargeIcon views.

2009-09-29  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: The location of the items should be computed on the fly
	in virtual mode - that decreased speed overall, but reduces the load
	time.that decreased speed overall, but reduces the load time. Also,
	handle the cases where we were using data structures we don't need to
	use/create for this mode.
	Fixes part of #467418.

2009-09-28  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Tile view and VirtualMode can't be applied together.
	Patch by Stephen Robinson <mono@esar.org.uk>.

2009-09-28  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When calculating the layout for Details view, don't ask
	for the items *at all* in case we are in virtual mode. This should
	re-enable the proper behaviour of virtual mode.

2009-09-26  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: When we invalidate a node, make sure we start at
	0, instead of the node's Bounds.Left, which does not include
	the +/-, checkbox, or stateimages.
	[Fixes bug #542481]

2009-09-24  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Compare the name and not displayname of properties 
	when checking if the column is already bound.

2009-09-21  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: For SelectedRtf, after inserting the stream, adjust
	the position of the caret by adding the needed chars represented by the new line chars,
	according to the system, using rich *or* hard new lines as needed. Also do a
	check to be sure we don't move the cursor position beyond the limits
	of our text. This should avoid problems with text being pasted,
	regarding the position of the caret.

2009-09-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: When SelectedRtf is set, and we are in the 0
	position in the x axis, force to re-use any already available line,
	even if it is not empty. This way pasting text into our textbox in the
	beginning for non empty lines should work fine.

2009-09-14  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: When we are inserting a flow of rtf text, and we are
	*not* loading it from a file, try to re-use a line if already
	available, since the default behaviour of the parser is to create new
	lines for the document.
	This should fix a regressions we found after the last fix for #513030.

2009-09-14  Tom Hindle <tom_hindle@sil.org>

	* ToolStripOverflow.cs: Fixes #536036 by adding null ptr check.

2009-09-11  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* PropertyGrid.cs: Hide the splitter when the help is hidden.

2009-09-11  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Call Invalidate-Update instead of 
	Refresh for MS compitability. Note also that Refresh is virtual 
	and several controls override it in order to provide data refresh 
	functionallity on top of the redraw and they do not expect this 
	extra refresh call.
	* Control.cs: In Refresh Invalidate the control and all children 
	insead of calling Refresh for each of them.
	[Fixes bug #538336]

2009-09-11  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* PropertyGrid.cs: Always set the help panel properties on the 
	internal control, because they are inherited and can change with 
	the parent.
	[Fixes bug #525305]

2009-09-08  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: When processing rtf, don't add a new line if we
	already have one for that position. This way we avoid overriding by
	mistake our lines when copying/pasting.
	Fixes #513030.

2009-09-07  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TextControl.cs: When inserting new lines, look for the end of file
	char, and remove chars after it. This is unlikely to happeng either
	loading a file, pasting text or pressing a char, but can happen using
	the TextBox.Text property.
	Fixes #535884.

2009-09-06  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Line.cs: In DeleteCharacters, cache line.Length for every tag, since
	tag.Start changes will modify it indirectly and then we would end up
	with wrong values.
	Fixes #512521.

2009-09-03  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* BindingSource.cs: Implement support for chained data sources.
	* ListBindingHelper.cs: Add support for ICurrencyManagerProvider and 
	clean up.
	[Fixes part of bug #536547]

2009-09-01  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: When saving the text to a file using SaveFile use
	Environment.NewLine to separate the lines. This way we should be
	saving the files according to the system.
	Fixes the remaining part of #511515.

2009-08-31  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* RichText.cs: Remove some unix new line characters and use
	Environment.NewLine. Fixes part of #511515.

2009-08-28  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Modified should *not* be modified from the Text
	property, as our new tests show. It should be to false, however, in
	Append and Clear; and Paste, Cut, Undo, and direct user input should set it
	to true. Also, as opposed to what the .net docs say -but proven by our
	tests-, the changes should be generating a ModifiedChanged event
	(thus we set the property, instead of the field).
	Fixes #511267.

2009-08-27  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Fire the CellDoubleClicked event.
	[Fixes bug #533430]

2009-08-27  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Add support for column DataGridViewAutoSizeColumnMode
	DisplayedCells and DisplayedCellsExceptHeader.
	[Fixes bug #533435]

2009-08-27  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TextControl.cs: When removing a simple char, actually record the
	action in the undo manager. This way we both support undoing the
	removal of chars using backspace/delete, as well as keeping data
	integrity when other undo tasks are performed.
	Fixes #531983.

2009-08-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Control.cs: Remove the ancient code in ResetText, which was setting
	the internal field to String.Empty, instead of doing it for our Text
	property, as .net does (which also causes a TextChanged event and all
	the other related routines).
	Fixes #531587.

2009-08-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Correctly implement Contains by using a
	linear search - there's no possible way to use a binary search, since
	the node instances are not implementing IComparable, nor have a
	specific order.
	Fixes #529927.

2009-08-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: If we are *not* changing a row
	already added to the source, and thus we are adding a new 
	row instead, try to move to the previous row when Esc is
	pressed -if possible-.
	Fixes some bits of #322974.

2009-08-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs:
	* DataGrid.cs: Moving the cell to the add row (the last one) should
	not immediately add a new row - this should happen until the very
	first change happens in that textbox.
	Fixes part of #322974.

2009-08-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolStripDropDown.cs: When assigning the owner item, use its Font as
	well.

2009-08-17  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: When the owner changes its Font, call the
	OnFontChanged event, so we let our users know that we likely have a
	new font - since Font is an ambient property.
	* ToolStripDropDownItem.cs: When our Font changes, propagate that
	information to our DropDown control, if any.
	Fixes #531515.

2009-08-17  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: 
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: When the user clicks on a new cell, we should reset any
	previous selection, just like .net does. Also, in the cases where a
	cell is being edited and it keeps the selected status, use the normal
	colors for it, and use the selected colors for the rest of the columns of
	that row.
	Fixes the remaining bits of #323051.

2009-08-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: When getting ProcessKeyPreview fired, call Edit() if we
	are not editing already - so the edition is actually active on our
	column style textbox. Also, it seems the code handling process the
	grid keys is repeated, but instead of removing it, just comment it for
	now.
	Fixes part of #323051.

2009-08-13  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* AsyncMethodResult.cs: Store a exception field in case the called
	method actually caused an exception. This way we can throw it later.
	* XplatUIDriver.cs: Check if the async method result has an exception
	- throw it if needed. 
	The idea is that Control.Invoke throws the exception from the thread
	that called it, not the main MWF thread. 
	Patch by Tom Spink <tspink@gmail.com>. Fixes #497175.

2009-08-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: In mouse move we need to shift the selection in case
	the pointer is on the row headers.
	Fixes #323052.

2009-08-11  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* SplitContainer.cs: Avoid updating the splitter distance if it hasn't 
	moved. Updating the distance was causing a re-layout which was resetting 
	the clicks counter and preventing DoubleClick from every firing.
	[Fixes bug #521387]

2009-08-11  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: When a new TableStyle is added, don't create new
	columns for it unless it is empty - this is the correct way to both
	respect the columns if they were provided by our user, or create them
	for him in case the column collection is empty.
	Fixes #323111.

2009-08-10  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* DataGrid.cs: Actually call BindColumns in the handler for
	ListManager.MetaDataChanged, since the current code is already taking
	into account the scenario when a custom table style is used - this was
	confusing us before, and that's why we commented the call to
	BindColumns. Also call CallAreasAndInvalidate, to properly reflect the
	changes as needed.
	Fixes #465021.

2009-08-10  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: When setting the data source, if we have a user
	provided table style available, force a complete bind in case the
	column styles for that table style is empty.

2009-08-09  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewCell.cs: Handle null and DBNull values.

2009-08-07 Rodrigo Kumpera  <rkumpera@novell.com>

	* ListBindingHelper.cs: Fix the 1.0 build by making this type available
	under that profile.

2009-08-07  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* CurrencyManager.cs: Remove duplicate code.

2009-08-07  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs, DataGridViewCell.cs, DataGridViewColumn.cs: 
	Massive population performance boost. From seconds to ms.
	[Fixes bug #528887]

2009-08-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: When handling mouse down on a column, don't do any sort
	even if the list supports it if we are empty. This way we avoid an exc
	sorting the empty list, and keep the UI compatible with .net.

2009-08-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: In Edit () check we have any row before trying to use
	the current row. Fixes a IOOR exc with an empty data grid.

2009-08-03  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs: Don't call CheckValidDataSource when setting
	the owner DataGrid - even if this seems to be the right thing to do,
	.net is not doind this check at this point, but in later operations.
	Fixes #465019.

2009-07-28  Mike Gorse  <mgorse@novell.com>

	* ToolStripMenuItem.cs: Added UIA CheckOnClickChanged event.

2009-07-28  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* Application.cs: Make FilterMessage internal for 1.1. Fixes the 1.1 build.

2009-07-28  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: We need to filter the messages using
	Application.FilterMessage for our DoEvents implementations. Observe
	that I don't like the idea of XplatUI call the upper level Application
	class, but at this point is easier and simpler to do this call - based
	on the fact it's only one simple call.
	Fixes #516735.

2009-07-28  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: When removing the selected node, set the
	SelectedNode value of TreeView to null if there aren't more nodes left - 
	this is better than to clear the selected node in Clear, since we need
	to handle the situation in the Remove methods as well.
	Fixes #525002.

2009-07-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolStripItemCollection.cs: Find should do a case insensitive
	search, and should throw an ArgumentNullException if the parameter is
	an empty string.

2009-07-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* PropertyGrid.cs: Use click handlers for each ToolStripButton instead
	of using a global handler for the ToolStrip. This way the buttons can
	be recovered and can have its PerformClick method called properly.
	Fixes #522454.

2009-07-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Implement support for XdndActionList, so we can get the
	complete list of the supported actions in the drag source, and use the
	action passed in the Position message only as a fallback. This will
	help us with dnd operations with non winforms apps.
	Fixes #402158.

2009-07-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolStripItemCollection.cs: Use a List<> instead of an ArrayList in
	Find. This should fix the exception we were getting when trying to
	convert the ArrayList to an array of objects (since we were losing the
	type parameter).
	Fixes #519944.

2009-07-17  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* RadioButton.cs: Setting Checked when none of the sibligs is checked
	should happen *not* in GotFocus, but in the Enter event. This is
	specially important since we should get that Checked behaviour even if
	no handle is created yet - and thus, no actual GotFocus call happens at
	the time.
	Fixes #520764.

2009-07-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Adjust manually the top border for out internal
	ComboBox, since removing the border from it leaves it without any
	margin. This is not noticeable in a default ComboBox, but it is in an
	instance shown on top of ToolStrip.
	Fixes the remaining part of #507462.

2009-07-13  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Expose the margin top width as a property, to keep
	the code clean.
	* ToolStripTextBox.cs: Since we are actually using no border in the
	default TextBox impl, and we are drawing the border ourselves, we need
	to manually set the top margin.
	Fixes part of #507462.

2009-07-06  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* PrintPreviewDialog.cs: Record when left was pressed, so we can
	simulate Tab+Alt when moving the focus throughout our buttons and
	controls.
	Fixes the remaining bits of #509142.

2009-07-05  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TabControl.cs: When computing the width of each tab page, use the
	page's Font instead of the tab control one.
	Fixes #514368.

2009-07-03  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* MenuAPI.cs: When handling the Keys.Left key, don't close the menu if
	the current menu is specifically a ContextMenu (this is what .net does
	as well). This way we also avoid a crash caused by MenuTracker trying
	to use the menu when it was already hidden.

2009-07-03  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* PrintPreviewDialog.cs: Remove the code used to handle the
	DropDown menu, since we are now doing it by default in ToolBar, and
	just call the base impl as needed.Also, deactivate the dropdown menu
	before moving the focus to a different button in our toolbar, as .net
	does.
	* ContextMenu.cs:
	* MenuAPI.cs: Make as internal the needed bits to deactivate a
	ContextMenu, and also to keep some beauty in our api.

2009-07-02  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolBar.cs: When handling the key down message, if we are on a
	drop down button, either show the DropDownMenu or pass the key to its
	ProcessCmdKey method as needed.
	Fixes the remaining bits of #509985.

2009-06-29  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolBar.cs: Isolate the event logic related to OnButtonClick. Also
	set current_item when navigating with the keyboard, so we can use it
	properly later. Finally, handle both Enter and Space to fire
	OnButtonClick *only*, without any other impact, as .net does.
	Fixes part of #509985.

2009-06-29  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Close any active menu when we get a simple Alt.
	Fixes #509299.

2009-06-26  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolBar.cs: In OnButtonClick only change the Pushed value for
	buttons with toogle style. We were previously doing it for
	DropDownButton's buttons, but that's not what .net is doing.
	Fixes #510030.

2009-06-26  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* XplatUICarbon.cs : support multi-byte text input.
	  Fixed bug #501276.

2009-06-22  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* ListBox.cs: When creating DrawItemEventArgs, pass either
	Theme.ColorHighlightText or ForeColor depending on the selected state
	of our item, as .net does.
	Fixes #512115.

2009-06-22  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: When handling WM_CHAR, process the message first, and
	send it to the textbox only if it wasn't handled.
	Fixes #507459.

2009-06-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Only do my big sort at the end of AddRange if
	the combobox is actually set to Sorted.

2009-06-18 Tom Hindle <tom_hindle@sil.org>
	
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Enabled Text to coexist with custom data formats.
	Fixes #511849.

2009-06-18  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: When calculating the scrollbars for non MultiColumn
	mode, force the use of the horizontal scrollbar only if
	ScrollAlwaysVisible is true as well.
	Fixes #513029.

2009-06-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: When using AddRange on a sorted combobox, don't
	try to use our inefficient sorted insert method, just append
	it and sort the whole thing at then end.
	[Fixes bug #511247]

2009-06-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolBar.cs: Expose as internal the code used to show a dropdown menu.
	* PrintPreviewDialog.cs: Handle the down/up arrow keys for our
	DropDown element.
	Fixes #509152.

2009-06-16  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Scrolling fixes.
	[Fixes bug #512816]

2009-06-16  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs, DataGridViewRowCollection.cs: Clean up a bit and 
	optimize for batch adding rows.

2009-06-16  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Avoid calling ReBind twice during the initial data 
	binding.
	[Fixes bug #512807]

2009-06-16  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Suppress invalidation during data binding.
	[Fixes part of bug #512807]

2009-06-15  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* PrintPreviewDialog.cs: Tune the navigation among the buttons and
	controls that are part of our ToolBar, so we can mimic the behaviour
	observed in .Net, by handling also the arrow keys and doing the
	preprocess for them too.
	Fixes the remaining bits of #509142.

2009-06-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolBar.cs: Expose the current item as internal.
	* PrintPreviewDialog.cs: Tune the TabStop property for
	PrintPreviewControl/ToolBar so we match the .net scenario regarding
	Tab navigation. Also implement support to navigate throughout the
	items in the ToolBar.
	Fixes #509142.

2009-06-09  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewComboBoxCell.cs, DataGridViewComboBoxColumn.cs: 
	Implement items syncing in the non-databound scenario.
	[Fixes bug #494031]

2009-06-09  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Call OnCellValidating and OnCellValidated and 
	handle the Cancel accordingly.
	[Fixes bug #506838]

2009-06-09  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewBand.cs: Fix a typo in DefaultHeaderCellType.
	[Fixes bug #506796]

2009-06-09  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewColumnCollection.cs, DataGridViewRowCollection.cs, 
	DataGridView.cs: Fire CollectionChangeAction.Refresh collection 
	changed when Clearing the collections so that the DataGridView 
	can know and reset the current cell.
	[Fixes bug #492549]

2009-06-09  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* BindingSource.cs: In ResetBindings use the ListChangedEventArgs ctor 
	with the PropertyDescriptor parameter instead of index, because the 
	latter will set some irelevant indices. Fixes a bug uncovered by recent
	 fix to ListChangedEventArgs.

2009-06-09  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* DataObject.cs: When looking for any specific format, do a case
	insensitive search, as .net does.
	Fixes #509199.

2009-06-09  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* CurrencyManager.cs: In AllowNew firstly check if the list is a 
	IBindingList and proxy to AllowNew. IBindingList has slightly differet 
	logic and eventhough it's an IList IsReadOnly should not be used in this 
	case as it might be True but AllowNew could be True as well.
	Fixes a bug uncovered by a fix to the Array class.

2009-06-08  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBindingHelper.cs: In GetListItemType do a null check when
	looking for IList.Item, since the impl could be explicit, and thus
	private. Fix by Florent Fayolle (p.ricca at odyssee-ingenierie.com).
	Fixes the remaining part of #507120

2009-06-07  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DataObject.cs: Map StringFormat/Text/UnicodeText formats properly,
	to match them in all the cases, as this is exactly what .net does.
	Fixes #510728.

2009-06-06  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBindingHelper.cs: In GetListItemType handle gracefully the case
	where an instance of IEnumerator returns a null value for its Current
	property. Fix by Florent Fayolle (p.ricca at odyssee-ingenierie.com).
	Fixes #507120.

2009-06-05  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Properly detect whether we need to use our vertical
	scrollbar or not, specially for DropDownList/DropDown styles,
	depending on the value of DropDownHeight.
	Fixes #508541.

2009-06-01  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* ToolTip.cs: Call the base implementation in Dispose, but do it
	before anything else to avoid a regression. This way we do the default
	routines related to any System.ComponentModel.Container.
	Fixes #508586.

2009-06-01  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Clipboard.cs:
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	* DataFormats.cs: Implement support for serializable types in our
	clipboard.
	Fixes #357642.

2009-05-25  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ColorDialog.cs: Actually add the help button to the form, so it can
	be visible.
	Fixes #478555.

2009-05-25  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* PrintPreviewDialog.cs: Don't use Dock.Fill for the
	PrintPreviewControl, since it will be hidden in the top by our
	toolbar. Use manual location and anchoring instead.
	Fixes #474889.

2009-05-25  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* FileDialog.cs: When saving the size of the dialog, use the
	ClientSize instead of Size, so we have always the same size for the
	form. Patch by Alex Shulgin.
	Fixes #503064.

2009-05-25  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MessageBox.cs: When showing the dialog call XplatUI.AudibleAlert to
	show a beep, similar to what .net does. 
	Fixes #473725.

2009-05-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs:
	* MenuStrip.cs
	* ToolStrip.cs: Implicit mnemonic processing should happen for every
	ToolStrip child, not only for MenuStrip, so we are going to do that in
	ToolStrip.ProcessMnemonic, where we already had that exactly
	functionality, but we are only just checking that either this instance
	is a ToolStripDropDownMenu instance or Alt has been pressed. Finally
	remove the extra code, since we are not going to use it now.
	Fixes the remaining bits of #503663.

2009-05-21  Neville Gao  <nevillegao@gmail.com>

	* ContextMenu.cs: Cleaned up UIA properties.

2009-05-20  Dick Porter  <dick@acm.org>

	* XplatUICarbon.cs: Add more locking around MessageQueue
	manipulations.

2009-05-18  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* DateTimePicker.cs: Call Focus in HideMonthCalendar to avoid
	duplication of code, as well as actually getting the focus back in
	*any* scenario where the drop down is closed.

2009-05-18 Tom Hindle <tom_hindle@sil.org>
	* ScrollableControl.cs: Ignore setting properties HScroll and 
	VScroll when AutoScroll is true.
	[Fixes bug #500213]

2009-05-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripRenderer.cs: Apply patch from Thomas Goldstein to make
	disabled graphics look closer to the ones that .Net produces.
	[Fixes bug #473660]

2009-05-18  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DateTimePicker.cs: When calculating the max width for the year part,
	use the current value, since *all* the possible values are exactly a 4
	digits number. This way we avoid a ArgumentOutOfRangeException trying
	to check against different values.
	Fixes #500917.

2009-05-15  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MessageBox.cs: When handling ProcessDialogChar, check that
	CancelButton is not null before trying to use it, to avoid a null ref
	exception. We don't need to do that on the ok/yes buttons, since they
	always exist.
	Fixes #503935.

2009-05-15  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* ListBox.cs: Handle the key down event in WndProc instead of doing it
	in an event handler, as we need to avoid any operation in case
	the user has handled it in its own OnKeyDown handler, and this can't
	be achieved since our handler would be the first one always.
	* FontDialog.cs: Update the calls since our method handling key down
	has been renamed.
	Fixes #503469.

2009-05-15  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Application.cs: We should dismiss the active ToolStrip when we
	receive a WM_SYSKEYDOWN message, instead of WM_SYSKEYUP, so the next
	keyboard short cut can be properly processed by another menu item.
	Fixes part of #503663.

2009-05-13  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* HtmlDocument.cs: If the objects are strings, wrap them in ""

2009-05-13  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* HtmlDocument.cs: Fix InvokeScript call (duh).

2009-05-11  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TextBox.cs: Expose IsAutoCompleteAvailable as internal.
	* ComboBox.cs: If auto complete is being used, it is needed to update
	the actual value of the combo box, doing it immediately if the user
	presses Enter, or doing it when our combo box loses focus. Finally,
	when handling Enter and Escape keys for the combobox, don't try to
	hide the listbox if it is not visible in the first place. 
	Fixes part of #489339.

2009-05-11  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolStripDropDownMenu.cs: Use the height returned by
	ToolStripItem.GetPreferredHeight to calculate our own height.

2009-05-10  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* TreeNode.cs: When setting Checked, do a double null check, since the
	current node can still get a null parent handling
	TreeView.OnAfterCheck.
	Fixes #502567.

2009-05-10  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Control.cs: When assigning ContextMenu, do a null check before
	assigning its container field.

2009-05-08  Brad Taylor  <brad@getcoded.net>

	* DateTimePicker.cs: Add a UIA-specific property to ensure that if
	is_checkbox_checked is changed, we won't break.

2009-05-08  Andrés G. Aragoneses  <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: Prevent NRE when our holder is a
	ToolStripDropDownButton and we get Select()ed.

2009-05-08  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* ToolStripControlHost.cs: DefaultSize must return the current size of
	the Control, not the value returned by GetPreferredSize. Also connect
	a handle to the control Resize event, and use it to fire
	OnHostedControlReize.
	Fixes the remaining bits of #483146.

2009-05-08  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolStripDropDown.cs: When performing the layout, use
	ToolStripItem.GetPreferredSize ().Height instead of
	ToolStripItem.Height, since we are already using it that way in this
	same method.
	Fixes part of ##483146.

2009-05-08  Brad Taylor  <brad@getcoded.net>

	* DateTimePicker.cs: Wrap UIA specific code in NET_2_0 wrappers.  Send
	OnUIASelectionChanged when ShowCheckbox is true and the checkbox
	recieves focus.  Part of fix for #502029.

2009-05-06  Mike Gorse  <mgorse@novell.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Add UIAFocusedItemChanged to PopupButtonPanel.
	Add PerformClick and PerformDoubleClick to PopupButton.
	Fixes #499851.

2009-05-04  Andrés G. Aragoneses  <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* TabControl.cs: call Focus() to emit GotFocus event at the
	proper time when SelectionIndex changes. Fixes #499887.

2009-05-03  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: In SetBoundsCore always do the bounds check to
	have valid values, even if BoundSpecified is not including
	Size/Height/Width - this is useful when we are in a control using Dock
	or Anchor.
	Fixes part of #483146.

2009-04-27  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: When losing the focus, if our textbox is not null,
	close its auto complete list, if any.
	Fixes part of #489339.

2009-04-27  Andrés G. Aragoneses  <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: Make OnColumnClick +internal to be used by a11y.

2009-04-27  Brad Taylor  <brad@getcoded.net>

	* ToolStripButton.cs: Emit an internal event when CheckOnClick is
	changed.

2009-04-26  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Properly support UTF8 when handling the
	SelectionRequest event - this is helpful supporting some window
	managers, such KDE, that explictly request the text in utf8, as
	opposed to gnome, that supports ascii.
	Fixes #489393.

2009-04-26  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolStripDropDownItem.cs: When assigning a new
	ToolStripDropDownMenu, let it know we are its OwnerItem. This way the
	Capture duties performed by Application/ToolStripManager are handled
	nicely and we don't end up in an inconsisten stat.
	Fixes #492815.

2009-04-25  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Even if we are not exactly a MenuStrip instance, close
	any ToolStripDropDownItem when receiving a mouse down event in an
	empty area.

2009-04-24  Andrés G. Aragoneses  <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* ToolBarButton.cs: add UIA events for style and dropdownmenu changes.

2009-04-24  Andrés G. Aragoneses  <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* ToolBarButton.cs: rename a method to include UIA prefix.

2009-04-24  Andrés G. Aragoneses  <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* ToolBarButton.cs: change visibility of some UIA methods from
	protected virtual to private.

2009-04-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolStripDropDown.cs: In OnVisibleChanged, if we have an OwnerItem,
	fire OnDropDownOpened/OnDropDownClosed depending on the new
	visibility. This also ensures that any direct access to this instance
	will fire the mentioned events for the OwnerItem.
	* ToolStripDropDownItem.cs: Remove the invocations to
	OnDropDownOpened/OnDropDownClosed, since they are handled in
	ToolStripDropDown, as well as updating the
	OnDropDownHide/OnDropDownShow calls to be in the right order.
	Fixes #496193.

2009-04-21  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Control.cs, ContextMenuStrip.cs, ToolStripMenuItem.cs: Only process any 
	shortchut in ToolStripMenuItem.ProcessCmdKey if the control generating the 
	event is the same as the owner of the menu item. Also set properly 
	SourceControl for ContextMenuStrip, as well as add an internal field to 
	contain the control that owns the ContextMenuStrip (we need to know this 
	even before the public property is assigned).
	Fixes bits of #393775.

2009-04-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* StatusStrip.cs: Use the same icon as .net when the mouse is over the
	size grip.
	Fixes #492828.

2009-04-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: When calculating the height of the ComboListBox,
	specially for the 2.0 profile, use MaxDropDownItems if the
	DropDownHeight property hasn't been set, and use the later if it has
	been set. This way we support both properties.
	Fixes #493308.

2009-04-14  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* ThreadExceptionDialog.cs: Draw the error icon, previously missing.
	Fixes #474253.

2009-04-14  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs: Implement support for Control.CausesValidation,
	by adding a pending list of controls to be validated in the top
	container control, and postpone validation as needed. 
	Also remove any control in the validation chain in case it gets removed 
	from its owner before the pending validation actually happens.
	Fixes #457170.

2009-04-09  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* ListBox.cs: The default instance StringFormat field used to draw our
	items should use the StringFormatFlags.NoWrap value, so it doesn't try
	to put in a different line the text that doesn't fit our bounds, but
	show it partially.
	Fixes #475581.

2009-04-09  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* CheckedListbox.cs: When executing OnItemClick check that the index
	is different to -1 before trying to retrieve an item using that value.
	Fixes a ArgumentOutOfRangeException thrown when the horizontal
	scrollbar was visible but not needed, and then a clicked was received
	on its area.

2009-04-08  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MaskedTextBox.cs: If Insert is pressed, change the internal
	overwrite mode for our default value.
	Fixes some bits of #477395.

2009-04-06  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* ListView.cs: In EnsureVisible avoid any direct access to items if we
	are using virtual mode - otherwise use the bounds stored in a specific
	item in a given index. This is specially important when using groups
	or when items are re-arranged, since the position in the items
	collection can be different than that one being displayed.
	Fixes the rest of ##491978.

2009-04-06  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Include the previous check for ListView in a
	2.0 define as needed.

2009-04-06  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Don't draw ListView's gridlines if we are using groups.
	Fixes part of #491978.

2009-04-06  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolTip.cs: New fields to store the title/icon information.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Implement support for tooltip's title and
	icon.
	Fixes #491978.

2009-04-03  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TabControl.cs: When removing a tab that was previously selected, set
	internally the value of selected_index to -1, to avoid trying to
	access the previous one when trying to set the new one (and was
	already removed from the collection). This is what .net seems to do
	too.
	Fixes #490937.

2009-04-02  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs, X11Clipboard.cs: Text and Rtf formats must be
	separated, and we cannot fallback on Text if Rtf is requested but not
	present.
	* Clipboard.cs: Actually use the format specified by our user when
	putting data.

2009-03-31  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* X11Clipboard.cs: Actually look for the RtfText format when calling
	GetRftText in our clipboard formats list, instead of using the
	generical Text format.

2009-03-30  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TextBox.cs: Process auto completion properly when we are using the
	internal source provided by ComboBox, and also remove some repeated
	checks.
	Fixes #489339.

2009-03-30 Tom Hindle <tom-hindle@sil.org>
	
	* DataGridView added Support for Invisible Columns to 
	AutoFillColumnsInternal method.

2009-03-30  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* X11Structs:
	* X11Clipboard.cs: Move internal ClipboardStruct from X11Structs to
	its own file, since it is adding some functionality and thus is not a
	simple struct as before.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Add support to store different formats that could
	have been specified by the user when puting data in the Clipboard -
	this is important when more than one format is supported (such plain
	text and rtf text). Update in the needed places, as well as simplify
	the code.
	Fixes #489625.

2009-03-30  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: When handling the SelectionRequest event, use
	SelectionRequestEvent instead of SelectionEvent, so we get the right
	data for the app asking for clipboard data. Set the member of
	SelectioneEvent.property to indicate the place where we are storing
	the information as well - this is specially important for gnome/kde
	apps using the TARGETS atom to ask for the supported permission before
	actually asking for a specific format.
	Fixes #489393.

2009-03-28  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewCell.cs: We don't support drawing all types of cell borders, 
	so fallback and at least draw something instead of nothing.

2009-03-27  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: If the column header isn't visible allow resizing 
	using the cell column border. Also be sure to reset the cursor properly.
	[Fixes bug #489929]

2009-03-26   Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: When disposing, iterate over the items in reverse
	order, since disposing the items modifies the collection.
	* ToolStripItem.cs: Remove from the owner when disposing.
	Fixes #485769.

2009-03-26  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Add an implementation for UpdateRowHeightInfo. No 
	longer throws a NotImplementedException.
	  Based on a patch by Tom Hindle <tom_hindle@sil.org>
	[Fixes bug #488319]

2009-03-26  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Implement IsCurrentRowDirty. No longer throws 
	NotImplementedException.

2009-03-26  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewColumn.cs, DataGridViewTextBoxColumn.cs: 
	Fix SortMode clash handling.
	[Fixes bug #488263]

2009-03-26  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Do not show the vertical scrollbar if there is only 
	one row or less. For the sake of MSNET compatibility.
	[Fixes bug #487988]

2009-03-26  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: When the current cell is moved out of the editing row 
	be sure to reset it back to a place holder row.

2009-03-19  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: If IsHandleCreated and the very first row is added 
	to the grid in a non-databound scenario - select the first cell.
	[Fixes bug #486881]

2009-03-19  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: If we are not databound and empty once the first row 
	gets added select the first cell.
	[Fixes bug #486881]

2009-03-19  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs, DataGridViewColumn.cs: Do not set Row/CellTemplate's
	DataGridView. They do not belong to a DataGridView.
	[Fixes bug #486645]

2009-03-19  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewCellCollection.cs, DataGridViewColumnCollection.cs: 
	Set indices and associate with DataGridView only after the item is 
	add to the internal list.
	[Fixes part of bug #486645]

2009-03-19  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Do not add any cells to the FullRowTemplate in RowCount. 
	FullRowTemplate already contains all the cells.
	[Fixes part of bug #486645]

2009-03-19  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs, DataGridViewCellCollection.cs: Split the column removal 
	to perform Pre and Post removal actions to allow the current cell to be 
	moved and all events fired properly before the column is removed.

2009-03-19  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs, DataGridViewRow.cs: Split the row removal to perform Pre and 
	Post removal action to allow the current cell to be moved and all events fired 
	properly before the row is removed.

2009-03-18  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Fire CellEnter and CellLeave events for the Cell.
	[Fixes bug #486640]

2009-03-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* XplatUICarbon.cs: Commit patch from Alex Shulgin that fixes window
	placement of popup windows on OSX.

2009-03-18  Matt Guo  <matt@mattguo.com>

	* FontDialog.cs: Override "ToString" for FontDialog.ColorComboBox.ColorComboBoxItem
	[Fixes bug #482690]

2009-03-18  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Implement the CellMouseDoubleClick event.
	[Fixes bug #486262]

2009-03-18  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Fix scrolling to take into account that the 
	scrollbars are actually inside the client area of the datagridview.

2009-03-18  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Implement mouse wheel scrolling.
	[Fixes bug #486159]

2009-03-17  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: When DataSource changes the rebinding should happen 
	not if IsHandleCreated but if BindingContext != null.
	[Fixes bug #486013]

2009-03-17  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Browsable(false) properties should be skipped when 
	autogenerating the columns.
	[Fixes bug #486021]

2009-03-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* DomainUpDown.cs: When ReadOnly is true, all the text entered by the
	user should use a different handling, trying to use every pressed char
	as a unique and only one prefix to compare against the items. Also,
	refactor some input check code to avoid duplication.
	Fixes #458607.

2009-03-16  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewCell.cs: In OwningColumng Handle invalid column index 
	silently.
	[Fixes bug #485278]

2009-03-16  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewBand.cs: Update our State whenever a property changes.
	* DataGridView.cs: Don't be so generous in reseting Displayed, because 
	it will spawn lots and lots of unneeded State changed events.
	[Fixes bug #484989]

2009-03-16  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs, DataGridViewRow.cs, DataGridViewColumn.cs: 
	Add support for invisible rows and columns.
	[Fixes bug #484951]

2009-03-16  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewCell.cs: Escape literal { in ToString.
	* DataGridViewTextBoxCell.cs: Fix ToString.
	[Fixes bug #484923]

2009-03-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: When navigating items using the keyboard properly handle
	the case when no item is selected - this way we should try to select
	the first or the last item depending on the direction, but no the
	second or third one, etc.

2209-03-15  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Form.cs: When calling ProcessCmdKey, just after checking for any
	MainMenu, check if there's an active ContextMenu that is *not* owned
	by the form - this is needed when a non-focusable control owns a
	ContextMenu but its ProcessCmdKey method can't be called since it
	can't receive any input.
	Fixes #477655.

2009-03-13  Neville Gao  <nevillegao@gmail.com>

	* ToolBar.cs: Sent ButtonClick events when button style is DropDown.
	* ContextMenu.cs: Add UIA Framework property UIAVisible to detect if
	ContextMenu is displayed.

2009-03-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: In GetMessage when F1 gets pressed, besides sending a
	WM_HELP message for the associated window, don't call
	NativeWindow.WndProc *at all*, since this could send a WM_*
	key-related to Control.WndProc. Also, return the keypress message, in
	case it needs to be preprocessed for any menu.
	Fixes #478476.

2009-03-08  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: When removing the first displayed row and moving 
	the current cell up one we must invalidate the first displayed row 
	index before calculating the row heights, etc.
	[Fixes bug #483202]

2009-03-08  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Fix three column bugs:
	   - Rows should be cleared (but not removed) if columns become 0.
	   - The current cell should get moved
	   - ColumnCount increase was adding too many columns.

2009-03-07  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Fix RowCount decrease which wasn't working well 
	in both scenarions - with and without editing row.

2009-03-06  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Be compatible with MS in that the scroll to 
	selection has a synchronous effect. The trick here is that in 
	order to avoid unnecessary calculations each time a row/column 
	is added/removed we recalculate the whole grid size just before 
	just before the scroll to selection.
	[Fixes bug #482478]

2009-03-06  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* RichTextBox.cs: LoadFile(string path) should pass by default
	RichTextBoxStreamType.RichText, without caring about the detection or
	extension of the file.

2009-03-06  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: When calling LoadFile, remove the extra EOL
	introduced by StreamReader, since it will convert the EOF to an EOL.
	Fixes #479646.

2009-03-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripDropDownMenu.cs: Use Math.Max instead of calculating
	preferred size twice.

2009-03-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripMenuItem.cs: Don't draw the dropdown arrow or shortcut
	string if we aren't on a ToolStripDropDownMenu.

2009-03-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripDropDownButton.cs, ToolStripItem.cs: Refactor some Button
	code from Item to Button.  Patch from Alex Shulgin.

2009-03-05  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripDrowDown.cs: Remove some hardcoded values and assumptions.
	* ToolStripDropDownButton.cs: This should use a ToolStripDropDownMenu,
	not a ToolStripDropDown.
	* ToolStripItem.cs: Don't use the item margins on a ToolStripDropDown.

2009-03-04  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Fix RowCount/ColumnCount decreasing.

	  Based on a patch by Tom Hindle <tom_hindle@sil.org>
	  [Fixes bug #482133]

2009-03-04  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs, DataGridViewElement.cs: 
	   - Always calls OnDataGridViewChanged() if the new DGV is 
	   not the same/null as the current one.
	   - Do not throw NREs when setting TopLeftHeaderCell to null
	   - Unset the DGV for TopLeftHeaderCell when replacing it
	  Based on a patch by Tom Hindle <tom_hindle@sil.org>
	  [Fixes bug #481681]

2009-03-04  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripDropDown.cs: When dismissing control due to ESC, don't
	hit a NRE if we are a ContextMenuStrip and do not have a parent.
	[Fixes bug #478616]

2009-03-01  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When removing items from a ListViewItemCollection
	contained in ListView (not in ListViewGroup), before actually removing
	the items remove them also from their -if any- associated groups. If
	the item is present in ListViewGroup.Items but not in ListView.Items,
	then don't remove it - this is *exactly* what .net seems to do.
	Fixes the remaining bits of #478689.

2009-02-28  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: In our MouseDown handler in ItemControl use the item in
	the very specific *real* position where the mouse was pressed, using
	GetItemAtDisplayIndex for that purpose, instead of directly accessing
	Items - this is specially useful when groups with Details view is
	used. This is what we do in other places when using groups.
	Fixes part of #478689.

2009-02-27  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* MaskedTextBox.cs: Properly replace selection when a new valid key
	is pressed - even when IsOverwriteMode is false. This is what .net
	does.

2009-02-27  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MaskedTextBox.cs: When setting Text and RejectOnFirstFailure is
	true, use MaskedTextProvider.Set instead of MaskedTextProvider.Replace, 
	since Set will keep the previous value in case of error (just what we
	need), but still call MaskedTextProvider.Clear if
	RejectOnFirstFailure is false - match .net.

2009-02-26  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MaskedTextBox.cs: When setting Text use the very precise algorithm
	that .net uses: iterate over every char of the new value, trying to
	use every char, and use a normal call to MaskedTextProvider.Replace
	call if RejectInputOnFirstFailure is true. Fire OnMaskInputRejected 
	in case of error in both cases, as well.
	Fixes #477408.

2009-02-25  Neville Gao  <nevillegao@gmail.com>

	* ColorDialog.cs: Added UIA Framwork Property:
	UIASelectedSmallColorControl.

2009-02-25  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MaskedTextBox.cs: Forgot to update the call of the new method
	introduces in the previous patch.

2009-02-25  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MaskedTextBox.cs: Handle OnKeyDown to properly process the Delete
	key. Also create a new method to avoid code duplication between
	OnKeyDown and OnKeyPress.
	Fixes #477388.

2009-02-24  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewCell.cs: Invalidate the datagrid when the cell is selected 
	or deselected.
	[Fixes bug #479124]

2009-02-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MaskedTextBox.cs: In OnKeyPress the IsOverwriteMode check is
	actually inversed, so put it the right way. Also, don't automatically
	look for the next editable item after adding a new one, but way for
	the next insertion (this is what .net does) - this is not needed when
	MaskedTextProvider.InsertAt is called however, since it already looks for the
	next editable position.
	Fixes the remaining bits of #477383.

2009-02-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* MaskedTextBox.cs: In OnKeyPress handle backspace by calling
	MaskedTextProvider.RemoveAt method. Also for setting the SelectionStart
	property after the text was modified, adjust the testPosition value
	depending on what method was called.
	Fixes part of #477383.

2009-02-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: For EnsureVisible, adjust the view port bounds based on
	the existence of the column headers, as well as using this information
	to adjust the vscrollbar value, so items never get hidden by the
	column headers.
	Fixes #478498.

2009-02-23  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Make the ScrollBars property work properly.

2009-02-22  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TextBox.cs: Some code lifting for AutoComplete's support. First,
	when handling non-navigation keys, save the original Text typed by the
	user, and don't motify it BEFORE. This was a design mistake, since the
	re-assignation happens only when navigating the append/suggest list,
	not while creating the matches. Also, process the Delete key just like 
	the backspace one. Finally, when handling WM_CHAR, ignore both Escape
	and Enter keys.
	Fixes some missing bits of #469967.

2009-02-22  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Fix row removal in the data-bound scenario.

2009-02-19  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewCell.cs: Use strict equality comparison in order to 
	prevent superfluous CellValueChanged events.

2009-02-19  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Do not reset the columns when the data list changes, 
	but only the rows. Fixes multiple bugs related to sorting, custom 
	column styles being reset and more.

2009-02-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Respect a PictureBox's Padding when
	drawing the image.

2009-02-18  Andrés G. Aragoneses  <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* ToolBarButton.cs: Oops, use the correct event (fix r127298).

2009-02-17  Andrés G. Aragoneses  <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* ToolBarButton.cs: Event for Enabled property (needed to fix
	  UIA #474197).

2009-02-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* TextBox.cs: When handling WndProc with autocomplete activated,
	event if the new text is not causing any change in the look up
	algorithm, save it as we normally do when numbers and letters.
	Fixes #469967.

2009-02-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: When Text/StateImageIndex/StateImageKey/NodeFont change
	Invalidate the proper bounds in the TreeView, not only resetting the
	width.
	Fixes #475542.

2009-02-09  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Don't return TreeView.BackColor when retrieving our own
	BackColor property. This is what .net does in both 1.1 and 2.0.
	* TreeView.cs: When selected_node is not the same as highlighted_node,
	we need to handle the back color in a different way, trying to use the
	node's BackColor if it's not Color.Empty.
	Fixes #464200.

2009-02-09  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: When canceling selection in our MouseUp handler,
	invalidate also the previous selected node bounds.
	Fixes #464191.

2009-02-07  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: End or if end fails then cancel the current edit 
	operation before clearing the data source.

2009-02-07  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Data-bind only after the handle is created.
	[Fixes bug #473680]

2009-02-06  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: When handling the MouseMove event, check if
	focused_node and selected_node fields are null - usually they are non
	null, since we have always a selected node, but canceling selection by
	handling BeforeSelect event leaves the two of them as null.
	Fixes #470451.

2009-02-06  Neville Gao  <nevillegao@gmail.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Control enabled to support accessibility.
	[Fixes Bug #472428]

2009-02-05  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewRowCollection.cs, DataGridView.cs: Fix row insertation: 
	   - Use ArrayList.Insert instead of the Item property so that the item 
	   is actually inserted and not an existing item replaced.
	   - Call DataGridView.OnRowsAddedInternal and drop internal from 
	   OnRowsAdded for binary compitability. This also fixes several 
	   redrawing issues.
	[Fixes bug #472968]

2009-02-05  Andrés G. Aragoneses  <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* ToolBarButton.cs: Doh, fire OnUIATextChanged *after* setting
	  the value.

2009-02-04  Andrés G. Aragoneses  <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* ToolBarButton.cs: Add another event (OnUIATextChanged).

2009-02-04  Andrés G. Aragoneses  <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* ToolBarButton: Fix typo in previous commit (r125704).

2009-02-04  Andrés G. Aragoneses  <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* ToolBar.cs, ToolBarButton.cs: Add new UIA events to know
	when a button gets focus, firing the events from the ToolBar.
	r: jpobst

2009-02-04  Mario Carrion  <mcarrion@novell.com>

	* ColumnHeader.cs: Raising ListView.ColumnWidthChanged when setting 
	Width.
	* ListView.cs: Internal method added: RaiseColumnWidthChanged, used by
	ColumnHeader to raise ColumnWidthChanged.
	[Fixes Bug #467086]

2009-02-03  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewRowCollection.cs, DataGridView.cs: Move row completion 
	code in the row collection code, so that the completion happens before 
	the CollectionChanged event, also better encapsulation.
	[Fixes bug #471987]

2009-02-02  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: When editing is finished do not remove the editing 
	row, because it has already become a real one. Instead add a new one.
	[Fixes bug #471754]

2009-02-02  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* TreeView.cs: When drawing the node's image, check that the index
	specified by the node is valid for the ImageList.
	Fixes #471094.

2009-02-02  Andrés G. Aragoneses  <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* ToolBar.cs: Add new UIAPerformClick method to be called by
	UIAutomationWinforms when someone calls Invoke() on the
	ToolBarButtonProvider. r: jpobst

2009-02-02  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Don't send a WM_SHOWWINDOW message when receiving
	MapNotify/UnmapNotify events - we are already firing those events in
	the proper places, so we avoid this way to send the same message two
	times. I'm leaving the handling code in case we could break something
	in the future, as this change seems dangerous (but needed).
	Fixes #467546.

2009-02-01  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Complete incomplete rows when they are added to 
	the grid.
	[Fixes bug #471068]

2009-02-01  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs, DataGridViewColumnCollection.cs: Ensure that the 
	binding is cleared prior to setting it to null. Fixes a regression 
	causing exceptions when the DataSource is set to null and then set 
	again to a data source.

2009-02-01  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs, DataGridViewImageColumn.cs, DataGridViewCell.cs: 
	   - Make Image/Bitmap cells work.
	   - Handle images with size greater than the cell.
	   - Default to MiddleCenter alignment for image cells.
	[Fixes bug #471101]

2009-01-30  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* UpDownBase.cs: Force Height to PreferredHeight.

2009-01-29  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: We should use utf8 handling clipboard transference
	with other x11 applications, and use utf16 when handling clipboard
	data in the class library. Update the related points as well.
	Fixes #468683.

2009-01-28  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewCell.cs: Format strings according to the supplied 
	CellStyle.Format.
	[Fixes bug #470384]

2009-01-28  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Reset the hover cell if it gets moved due to row(s) 
	addition or removal. Fixes multiple crashes in OnMouseMove.

2009-01-27  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Fix a NRE when setting the CurrentCell to null.

2009-01-27  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Fire Timer.Tick even if there is no MainForm for the 
	current context.
	[Fixes bug #469239]

2009-01-26  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* WebBrowser.cs: fix initial value of ScrollbarsEnabled, so they
	won't be disabled by default.
	Fixes #468690

2009-01-26  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Do not clear the rows if we are not databound.

2009-01-26  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Do not be too smart about selecting the first cell 
	when the first row is added as this is not what MS does. Fixes the 
	failing unit tests.

2009-01-26  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: NextVisibleNode and PrevVisibleNode properties don't
	take into account the fact that OpenTreeNodeEnumerator needs to call
	MoveNext/MovePrevious to actually put the passed node as the one
	retrieved in Current. This way this property should work as really
	expected in .net.
	Fixes part of #467225.

2000-01-26  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: When calculating the scrollbars, don't use
	TreeNode.Bounds, since it still can have the values of the previous
	-and now invalid- layout -which depends on TreeView.skipped_nodes, and
	could not have been updated as well-, and use the actual number of
	visible number of nodes to compute the height needed to contain all
	the nodes. Also reset the value of vbar to 0 when disabled - this way
	we make sure that, when re-enabled, it will update the visible area of
	the treeview, even if the previous value before disabling it is the
	same as now. Finally don't do anything for the vbar.ValueChanged
	handler - for the case wheer we manually set the value but don't the
	vbar is disabled already.
	Fixes part of #467225.

2009-01-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Switch from foreach to for, in case the collection
	somehow changes while enumerating it.

2009-01-23  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs, DataGridViewCell.cs: Fix crashes when there is no 
	editing control.

2009-01-23  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Fix new row adding/editing in the non-databound 
	scenario.

2009-01-21  Mike Gorse  <mgorse@novell.com>

	* TrackBar.cs: Make LargeIncrement/Decrement internal so that UIA can
	  use them.
	  Added UIAValueParamChangedEvent.

2009-01-21  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: In CollapseAll, set vbar to the maximum value, instead
	of trying to set as top node the highest parent of the previous top
	node. Moving to the bottom of the TreeView after a call to CollapseAll
	is exactly what .net does. This should avoid some nasty issue when
	CollapseAll is called and we don't need the vertical scroll bar.

2009-01-21  Mario Carrion <mcarrion@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: UIA Support: Internal events added: UIAWindowStateChanged
	and UIATopMostChanged.

2009-01-21  Sandy Armstrong  <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com>

	* MenuItem.cs: Add UIACheckChanged, UIARadioCheckChanged,
	UIAEnabledChanged, and UIATextChanged events.

	* Form.cs: Add UIAMenuChanged event.

	* Menu.cs:
	* MenuAPI.cs: Note which internal APIs are being used by UIA.

2009-01-21  Neville Gao  <nevillegao@gmail.com>

	* ToolBar.cs: Control enabled to support accessibility.
	[Fixes Bug #455950]

2009-01-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: When handling mouse up event, check whether
	highlighted_node is null or not - usually it should be non-null
	alwaays, since the mouse down handler sets it, but some externa
	operations, such TreeNodeCollection.Clear, could set it to null.
	Fixes #438650.

2009-01-19  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Draw the menu item shortcut even if the menu 
	item is disabled.

2009-01-19  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Do not handle shortcuts if the menu item is disabled.
	[Fixes bug #467285]

2009-01-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: When handling the selection changes using the
	mouse, don't set SelectionRange if the selection range didn't actually
	change. This matters because, even if we set the range to the same
	previous range, an extra DateChanged event is fired. Just to be clear:
	SelectionRage property doesn't check whether the new value is
	different to the previous one (by ref equals doesn't work here).
	Fixes other bits of #364914.

2009-01-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* MonthCalendar.cs: Remove the extra OnDateChanged call when handling
	selection using the keyboard, since we are already firing this event
	when setting SelectionRange. Also don't set SelectionRange if the
	previous and the new value are the same (the property, just as .net
	does, doesn't check whether the previous value and the new one are the
	same). This saves us from firing OnDateChanged event if the selection
	range didn't change actually.
	Fixes the remaining bits of #364914.

2009-01-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: When removing an item and the last item is selected,
	remove it from the selection, and if selection mode is One try to
	select the new last item.
	Fixes #465422.

2009-01-16  Mike Gorse  <mgorse@novell.com>

	* Splitter.cs: Make MaxSize internal so that UIA code can use it.

2009-01-16  Mario Carrion <mcarrion@novell.com>

	* ColumnHeader.cs: UIA Support: raising internal event UIATextChanged 
	when changing Text. 

2009-01-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@ggmail.com>

	* X11Structs.cs:
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Properly encode/decode the unicode strings we
	store/retrieve in the Clipboard. Also, since we try to convert the
	data to different formats, separate the source and the result of
	it, so we can always fallback to the original and don't mix wrong
	conversions.

2009-01-16  Mike Gorse  <mgorse@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Add UIASelectionChanged event.

2009-01-16  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Forward the first key events to the editing control.
	[Fixes bug #457307]

2009-01-14  Andrés G. Aragoneses  <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* Application.cs: Oops, launch the copied handler of PreRun instead of
	the global one (gendarme would bark otherwise). (Improving r123375)

2009-01-14  Andrés G. Aragoneses  <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs:
	* Application.cs: Move the PreRun event fire to the end of the XplatUI
	static ctor (we don't move the PreRun event to this class because its
	usage would cause the call to the static ctor). This way we can get
	a11y support for dialogs that run without App.Run.

2009-01-14  Andrés G. Aragoneses  <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: New internal property to know the inner array's length of
	the location of items, in order to avoid a try-catch strategy for the
	case when this array has not been resized yet (for reference, look at
	r123288). r: jpobst

2009-01-13  Andrés G. Aragoneses  <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* Application.cs: Simplify UIA initialization, reducing it from 4 to 1
	reflection calls. This requires UIAutomationWinforms r123213.

2009-01-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* MonthCalendar.cs: Detect selection changes in MouseDown/MouseMove
	handlers and fire the DateSelected event until MouseUp is reached,
	like .net does, instead of firing it for each mouse event.
	Fixes part of #364914.

2009-01-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: When the selection gets canceled using the BeforeSelect
	event, invalidate the previous highlighted_node bounds, to show the
	user that the item was *not* selected.
	Fixes #464191.

2009-01-11  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Separate some scroll logic: setting SelectedIndex, as
	well as -in DropDown and Simple modes- writing in the textbox should
	try to set the requested item as the top one, but navigating with the
	keyboard and handling mouse selection don't need that behaviour. Also,
	when resetting selected_index handling key press events, reset
	ComboListBox.HighlightIndex. 
	Fixes the remaining bits of #464188.

2009-01-11  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Fix crashes when shortcut keys are pressed, but 
	there are no cells:
	   - CurrentCellAddress should be -1, -1 and not 0, 0.
	   - Be tolerant and fall back to clearing the current cell if either 
	   column or row is -1 in MoveCurrentCell.
	   - Misc. more -1 checks.

	introduced by the data binding position tracking code.

2009-01-11  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* ComboBox.cs: When setting the text and adjusting the top_item, do it

	Fixes part of #464188.

2009-01-09  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Requesting the CurrencyManager for the first time can 
	lead to unexpected OnBindingContextChanged calls and recursive rebinding. 
	Fix that.

2009-01-08  Brad Taylor  <brad@getcoded.net>

	* ComboBox.cs: Expose a few private fields as internal UIA properties.

	* DataGrid.cs: CWL removed.

2009-01-06  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* RadioButton.cs: When setting Checked, we should first update the
	check state of the current RadioButton, as well as invalidating it,
	and after that actually update the siblings. This is done to match
	.net.
	Fixes the remaining bits of #463028.

2009-01-05  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* RadioButton.cs: Setting Checked to false should set TabStop to stop
	as well. Also, when we get the focus and no other RadioButton is
	selected in the parent control, we should mark ourselves as Checked.
	Fixes part of #463028.

2009-01-05  Mario Carrion <mcarrion@novell.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: UIA suppport. internal events: 
	UIAGridCellChanged, UIAColumnsHeadersVisibleChanged,

	UIARowHeight, UIACellsArea, UIACaptionArea, 
	UIAColumnHeadersArea, UIASelectedRows, UIACurrentTableStyle, 
	UIAVScrollBar and UIAHScrollBar.

	* ToolStripSplitStackLayout.cs: Enable the overflow button if any
	of the buttons are set to Overflow = Always.
	[Fixes bug #463013]

2009-01-03  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* BindingNavigator.cs: Properly enable/disable the toolstrip buttons,
	based on whether the binding source is availble or not. Fixes #463008.

2009-01-03  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewCell.cs: We should return a value even if we are not bound 
	to a DataGridView.

2009-01-02  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* CurrencyManager.cs, DataGrid.cs: 
	   - Rename CanAddRows to AllowNew. The CurrencyManager has no 
	   concept of "rows".
	   - Add two more internal properties AllowRemove and AllowEdit.
	* DataGridView.cs: Refactor in a data-bound situation AllowUserToAddRows, 
	AllowUserToDeleteRows and cell ReadOnly state to be also checked against the 
	CurrencyManager data source.

2009-01-02  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Fix crashes caused by assigning negative values to 
	ScrollBar.LargeIncrement when the ClientSize.Width/Height is less than 
	the column/row heights/widths.
	[Fixes bug #462684]

2009-01-02  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Non-autogenerated columns that have a data property 
	set that exists in the current datasource should be set to be data-bound.

2009-01-02  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Fix column sorting for columns containing null 
	values. A "null" value is not always "null" (e.g could be String.Empty) 
	and thus parsing numeric types throwed an exception for "null" values.

2009-01-02  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Detach the editing control when the edit is 
	finished.

2009-01-02  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Multiple fixes to handle last column/row removal 
	and cell movement after that instead of throwing exceptions.

2009-01-02  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewCellCollection.cs: When cells are removed the column 
	indices become invalid if the cell is not the last one and have to 
	be refreshed.

2009-01-01  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Return false in CommitEdit if there was an error.

2009-01-01  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Remove a leftover Console.WriteLine.

2009-01-01  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewRow.cs: Access the indexer of the data manager directly 
	instead of the internal list.

2009-01-01  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewCell.cs, DataGridView.cs, DataGridViewCheckBoxCell.cs: 
	Rewrite the value getting, setting, parsing, formatting logic:
	   - If data-bound value get/set should actually get and set from the 
	     data source.
	   - Make proper usage of TypeConverters for value parsing/formatting.
	   - Raise DataError if setting the new value fails.
	   - Get rid off the internal valueType field and get/set the ValueType 
	   property instead.
	[Fixes bug #462051]

2009-01-01  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Rewrite the DataBinding layer:
	   - Get rid off all BindingSource/IBindingList/DataSet/DataTable 
	   specific code.
	   - Get rid off the per DataSource type column autogeneration code.
	   - Use the CurrencyManager for everything that is DataBinding related.

2009-01-01  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* CurrencyManager.cs: Do not fire duplicate ListChanged events.

2008-12-31  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs, DataGridViewRow.cs: Add a new internal property 
	DataManager to fetch the CurrencyManager for the DataGridView and to 
	spare this logic for the other components to follow.

2008-12-31  Mario Carrion  <mcarrion@novell.com>

	* MessageBox.cs: UIA support: new properties: UIAMessage, 
	UIAMessageRectangle and UIAIconRectangle.

2008-12-31  Sandy Armstrong  <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Add PopupButtonPanel.PopupButton.PerformClick method
	and DirComboBox.DirComboBoxItem.ToString override for UIA support.

2008-12-31  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Do not autogenerate duplicate column for a 
	data member that has already problematically been assigned one.
	[Fixes bug #457305]

2008-12-30  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ProfessionalColorTable.cs: Better detection of user's theme.
	[Fixes bug #462766]

2008-12-30  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: In the case where there are no autogenerated 
	columns and the user adds columns problematically we must generate 
	the rows after the very first column is added.

2008-12-30  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DateTimePicker.cs: When increasing/decreasing the value of month
	with ShowUpDown set to true, moving from december to january, and
	moving from january to december should adjust the year to the next and
	the previous year, respectively.
	Fixes the remaining bits of #459674.

2008-12-30  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: If a new cell is selected edit mode should be 
	immediately enabled only if EditOnEnter is set. Whether the mouse 
	or not was used to select the cell is irrelevant.

2008-12-29  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Remove a bogus ReBind call, which was causing 
	recursive rebinding.

2008-12-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DateTimePicker.cs: Handle the "MMMM" month format.
	Fixes #459674.

2008-12-23  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: 
	   - Make ReBind private and refactor various calls to call ReBind 
	   instead of ClearBinding/DoBinding
	   - Rebind when the column collection changes
	* DataGridViewColumnCollection.cs: 
	   - Leave the rebinding on change to be handled by the DataGridView.

2008-12-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: Add a ReBind convenience method.
	* DataGridViewColumnCollection.cs: Rebind when a column is added.
	[Fixes bug #462019]

2008-12-23  Neville Gao  <nevillegao@gmail.com>

	* StatusBar.cs: Modified argument variable.
	* SplitContainer.cs: Control enabled to support accessibility.
	[Fixes Bug #455950]

2008-12-22  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripMenuItem.cs: Guard against an NRE.
	[Fixes bug #457110]

2008-12-22  Mario Carrion  <mcarrion@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: AccessibleXXXX properties don't return 
	AccessibleObject.XXXX, instead a local referece is returned.

2008-12-22  Neville Gao  <nevillegao@gmail.com>

	* PrintPreviewControl.cs: Added internal properties to support
	accessibility.
	[Fixes Bug #459699]

2008-12-19  Mario Carrion  <mcarrion@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Reverted r121561. 

2008-12-19  Andrés G. Aragoneses  <aaragoneses@novell.com>

	* X11DesktopColors.cs: Since r121873 we don't need gtk a11y checks here,
	it has been moved to the bridge.

2008-12-18  Brad Taylor  <brad@getcoded.net>

	* DateTimePicker.cs: Add a few UIA specific events, and a couple
	internal methods useful for UIA.

2008-12-18  Mario Carrion <mcarrion@novell.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Fixed GetItemRectangle when MultiColumn is true.
	[Fixes Bug #455752]

2008-12-17  Mike Gorse  <mgorse@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs, ListViewItem.cs: Send OnUIAFocusedItemChanged if an
	  item's Focused property is set.

2008-12-17  Sandy Armstrong  <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs:
	* TreeNode.cs:
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Add events for UIA support:
	UIACheckBoxesChanged, UIALabelEditChanged, UIANodeTextChanged, and
	UIACollectionChanged.

2008-12-17  Bill Holmes  <billholmes54@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs (ListViewSubItem.ctor): Initalizing the 
	  SubItemStyle member field. 

	Contributed under MIT/X11 license.

2008-12-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: In MultiColumn mode don't use top_index to calculate the
	y coord, since it's useless in this case, and we need to rely only on
	the number of rows and ItemHeight to compute this value.
	Fixes part of #257471.

2008-12-15  Mike Gorse  <mgorse@novell.com>

	* StatusBar.cs: Send OnUIACollectionChanged in Remove().

2008-12-15  Mario Carrion  <mcarrion@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Accessibility properties instantiate AccessibilityObject when
	needed.
	[Fixes Bug #459223]

2008-12-15  Brad Taylor  <brad@getcoded.net>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: Add a UIA specific event for listening for when a
	ToolStripItem becomes selected or deselected.

2008-12-15  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: Select the date in MouseDown, not in MouseUp, as
	.net does. Use the date in the point of the mouse move coords as the
	new range as well, if the left button of the mouse is being pressed.
	Fixes #364914.

2008-12-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* MonthCalendar.cs: When modifying either AnnuallyBoldedDates,
	MonthlyBoldedDates or BoldedDates call UpdateBoldedDates, to
	effectively repaint the control.
	Fixes the remaining bits of #417961.

2008-12-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: When setting MaxDate/MinDate, adjust the selected
	range to contain only dates within the new possible range.
	Fixes part of #417961.

2008-12-11  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MaskedTextBox.cs: MaskedTextService.Replace doesn't expect the
	length of the text, but the end position, so we need to substract 1 to
	have a valid value. Also, in the same InputText method, don't use
	SelectionLength as the length of the text, since the selected text
	could actually be empty, but we need to set the value anyway.
	Fixes #457370.

2008-12-10  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TextBox.cs: Don't do any auto complete task if the custom source is
	null or empty. Also avoid duplication of code.
	Fixes #457743.

2008-12-09  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Refresh column sizes when new rows are added.
	[Fixes bug #457050]

2008-12-09  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 
	* RichTextBox.cs: When parsing the contents of a rtf file, don't call
	Split to create a line - we are already doing this, by _adding_ a new
	one when rtf_cursor_x is 0 (this field gets this value just after we
	receive the newline param as true). This avoids having a proportional number
	of empty lines in the end of the rich text box.
	Fixes #396664.

2008-12-09  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: When saving the contents as a plain text, don't add
	a new line for every Line structure, since the data in Document
	already contains the new line characters. This avoids duplicated new
	lines using the Save methods.
	Fixes #445618.

2008-12-09  Sandy Armstrong  <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Expose ScrollBars as internal properties, for use by UIA
	framework.  Fixes bug #457678.

2008-12-08  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewRow.cs: Prevent an exception on a not yet databound grid, 
	where datasource is null.
	[Fixes exception reported in bug 441240]

2008-12-08  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: EndEdit validation fixes.

2008-12-08  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: This is the cool patch that adds support for 
	actually updating the data in the databinding backend after editing. 
	With bonus firing and handling the DataError event.

2008-12-08  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Line.cs: When calculating the text tags's Shift value, store it as
	pixels instead of points. This way we can actually handle different
	fonts in the same RichTextBox, as well as the right size of the caret.
	Fixes part of #351938.

2008-12-08  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewCheckBoxCell.cs: Fix to make it work. Wrong value was 
	casted to CheckState causing InvalidCastExceptions.

2008-12-08  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Fix the DataGridViewEditMode.EditOnEnter behavior 
	to not depend on the item being clicked.

2008-12-08  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Implement NotifyCurrentCellDirty, so that it no 
	longer throws a NotImplementedException.

2008-12-08  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Set EditingControlFormattedValue when preparing an 
	IDataGridViewEditingControl for editing.

2008-12-08  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewComboBoxCell.cs: Implement data binding support.

2008-12-08  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Use the CurrencyManager to update the data source 
	binding position instead of casting the data sourcde to BindingSource.
	This enables position updating for other type of data sources.

2008-12-08  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* ComboBox.cs: Update the SelectedIndex before updating the Text 
	in OnDisplayMemberChanged.

2008-12-07  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Fix our support for IDataGridViewEditingControl.
	[Fixes bug #457112]

2008-12-06  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Sorting fixes:
	   - Be strict when sorting is enabled.
	   - If there is a data source delegate the sorting request.

2008-12-06  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* Binding.cs: When converting the data also try with the destination 
	type typeconverter. This indirectly adds support for Nullable types 
	in our databinding layer.

2008-12-06  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: When cell editing is finished focus back the 
	DataGridView. Fixes keyboard navigation post-editing.

2008-12-06  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Fix the cell editing by delaying the currentCell 
	setting to after EndEdit is called for the old cell.

2008-12-06  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* BindingSource.cs: Reset the bindings. Fixes a NotWorking test.

2008-12-06  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Send WM_HELP only to the focused window.

2008-12-05  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* CurrencyManager.cs: Fix exceptions when resetting the data source 
	for the same time (e.g. in ComboBox): 
	   - Do not set the list position if we are still transferring data
	   - When resetting the list firstly push the data then update the 
	   binding.
	* Binding.cs: Check BindingManager.Position == -1 instead of 
	BindingManager.Current == null in order to avoid unexpected 
	exceptions.

2008-12-05  Brad Taylor  <brad@getcoded.net>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: Add UIA specific events so that we can know when
	the selection changes, and when MaxSelectedCount changes.

2008-12-05  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Cleanup rows_displayed out of OnPaint. It's not 
	used for anything.

2008-12-05  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Fix scrolling and selection of cells/rows prior
	to the control being drawn for the first time by:
	   - Implement DisplayedRowsCount to not rely on the control being
	   already painted. Also added support for the partial row flag.
	   - Fix scrolling to take into account partial rows and scroll to
	   them.
	[Fixes bug #456527]

2008-12-05  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Do not reset the CurrentCell when the handle is
	created if the user has already set it.

2008-12-05  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Fix CurrentCell to actually select the cell.

2008-12-01  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Add support to RichTextFormat by reading it as ascii
	text and then let the underneath users of IDataObject interpret and
	parse by themselves. 
	Fixes #439251.

2008-12-01  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Fix my previous commit to actually update what it 
	was supposed to.

2008-12-01  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Ensure that when a row is removed the all the 
	current row/column/cell get updated. Fixes multiple exceptions.

2008-12-01  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	is used.
	[Fixes bug #443560]

2008-12-01  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	new state.
	[Fixes issue 1 in bug #443560]

2008-12-01  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Invalidate after the current row/column seletion 
	chagnes.
	[Fixes bug #438434]

2008-12-01  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Refresh the data if the data list is reset, etc.

2008-12-01  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Handle datasource state changes:
	   - IBindingList - list changes
	   - BindingSource - list changed and datasource changes

2008-11-30  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Select the first cell when databound. 
	Visually select when CurrentCell is set.

2008-11-30  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Set the current cell before raising CellClick.

2008-11-30  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Cleanup MoveCurrentCell to not fire any CellEnter, 
	CellLeave events as this is already done in SetCurrentCellAddressCore.

2008-11-30  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Set the minimum size for the columns to be the 
	width of their header, so that the columns don't get squashed 
	all together.

2008-11-30  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: After the data is bound PerformLayout, so that 
	the columns get autosized.

2008-11-30  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Move all currentCell setting code into 
	one central place - SetCurrentCellAddressCore. That way the 
	current cell is properly updated when programatically set.
	Fire RowEnter/Leave events.

2008-11-30  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Update the CurrencyManager.Position, so that 
	when a BindingSource is used BindingSource.Current will be correct.

2008-11-30  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* GroupBoxRenderer.cs: Fix when VisualStyles disabled:
	   - No caption text is drawn because Color.Empty is used.
	   - Fix top and height off by 1.

2008-11-30  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* DataGridViewRow.cs: Implement DataBoundItem.

2008-11-30  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* BindingSource.cs: Return null for Current if there is no data present.

2008-11-29  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Add a Menu.SelectedItem null check when navigating the
	menus using the arrow keys. Also when handling the left arrow key, don't 
	assign the current menu to the parent one, if the parent is null.
	Fixes #446392.

2008-11-24  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* PrintPreviewDialog.cs: Fix toolbar size, height must be 26. Fixes bug
	#413501.

2008-11-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Scrollbar.cs:
	* ScrollableControl.cs: Simplify the code to manually set the size of
	the thum area, avoiding duplication of code, and also preserving the
	right value for different code paths - this can happen when size
	changes are made to the scrollbar after setting LargeChange, Maximum
	or related properties for the ScrollBar.

2008-11-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ScrollableControl.cs: When scrolling, don't invalidate the entire
	area, and call to XplatUIX11.ScrollWindow instead. This is exactly
	what .Net does: copy the visible area, and only invalidate the part of
	the area that wasn't visible before scrolling.
	Fixes #441738.

2008-11-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: Listen for a DataTable's TableCleared event so we
	can clear ourselves when it is raised, we don't have a newrowindex
	if we don't have any columns.
	* DataGridViewRowCollection.cs: Ensure we always delete all the rows,
	re-index after each delete so the NewRow will have the correct index.
	[Fixes bug #448005]

2008-11-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Don't change min/max size if it is empty.
	[Fixes bug #447873]

2008-11-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs:
	* ScrollableControl.cs: When the manual thumb size is used, the
	maximum allowed value should depend on that thumb size, instead of
	LargeChange (using the maximum - LargeChange + 1 value). But
	LargeChange should be used normally when incrementing/decrementing.
	Fixes the remaining part of #441546.

2008-11-23  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* WebBrowser.cs, WebBrowserBase.cs: Delay loading of DocumentStream 
	until an about:blank has been loaded (according to spec). Fix 
	ScrollbarsEnabled to set when a document is loaded (since we use js 
	for it). Fix url so it reflects the current loading document and not 
	the previous one. Send StatusChanged events.

2008-11-23  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Application.cs: If a message comes in for an embedded control
	(like webbrowser) when we're capturing the keyboard, release the
	capture and continue.
	[fixes #429462]

2008-11-22  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

2008-11-21  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs: Ensure that we can run on .net 2.0 with mono 2.2 where
	PlatformID.MacOSX now exists.

2008-11-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Provide a default implementation for ChangeBackColor.
	Having something internal abstract isn't very nice for people who want
	to inherit from this class.

2008-11-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	ImageSize for calculations.

2008-11-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Call HideWindow instead of Hide when closing the dropdown

2008-11-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DomainUpDown.cs: Remove string cache and reflection optimizations.  They
	aren't always correct, and fixing them for every case is not worth the
	negligible benefit they provide.
	[Fixes bug #445713]

2008-11-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: We should never add actual cells to the RowTemplate.

	* DataGridViewRowCollection.cs: Use RowTemplateFull.

2008-11-17  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	Fixes #444347.

2008-11-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

2008-11-06  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	and Count items should be enabled if the BindingSource is non null and
	non empty.
	Fixes #439961.

2008-11-05  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Don't raise SelectedIndexChanged until we have
	actually modified the tab collection, so TabCount will be correct.
	[Fixes bug #441896]

	duplicating the check in other places.

2008-11-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When calculating layout, refresh the count of items
	belonging to the default item, insteas of doing it only one time. This

	* ListView.cs:
	* ListViewItem.cs:

	Fixes part of #437933.

2008-10-31  Andreia Gaita  <shana@jitted.com>

	* Form.cs (SetVisibleCore): since set_ActiveControl no longer calls focus
	  if the container is not focused already, we need to specifically set
	  focus to the first available control, or to the form itself if there
	  are no controls.

2008-10-31  Andreia Gaita  <shana@jitted.com>

	activate message fix: a call to .Show now waits until both WM_SHOWWINDOW and
	WM_ACTIVATE have been processed before returning, so it is guaranteed that
	once it returns and the form is visible, it is actually on the screen on X11

	* ContainerControl.cs: Only send focus to the control if the top container
	  is already focused. This is so that, when a form is first shown, all
	  the enter/leave events are done first before any focus stuff comes in.
	  If a control has no top container, there's an extra check on Control.Focus
	  to make sure it gets focused in this particular case.

	* Control.cs: Force focus if the control is active but did not receive
	  focus after being set as active.

	* MdiClient.cs: Dispose the form when closing

	* XplatUIX11.cs: When mapping and unmapping windows, make sure the call
	  doesn't return until both WM_SHOWWINDOW and WM_ACTIVATE have come in
	  if the window is a top Form.
	  Reset all hwnd properties when the window has been destroyed so that
	  we don't land in any codepaths that might try to do something with it.
	  Added a bunch of debugging messages. If TRACE is defined, all X calls
	  are logged through DebugHelper. Set a few missing EntryPoint attributes.

2008-10-29  Mario Carrion <mcarrion@novell.com>

	is more precise- than the previous AutoCompleteMatches one.
	This should the keyboard navigation in ComboBox when using auto

	* ToolStripSplitButton.cs: Fix up some bounding rectangles to take
	the item's location into account.

2008-10-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	cases were we lack information.
	Fixes #417520.

2008-10-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When removing an item from a main ListView.Items
	collection (and not a ListViewGroupCollection.Items one), remove it
	also from the group, as .net does. Patch by Mario Carrion (mario at
	novell dot com).
	Fixes #436653.

2008-10-19  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* ColumnHeader.cs: Invalidate ListView.header_control when setting

	* StatusBarPanel.cs: Control enabled to support accessibility.
	[Fixes bug #435988]

2008-10-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: When a user begins an edit in the 'new row',
	make that a real row, and add a new 'new row'.  If the user
	cancels the edit, remove the new 'new row' and reset everything.
	Also, ensure UserAddedRow and UserRemovedRow events are raised.

	* ComboBox.cs: WM_KEYDOWN and WM_KEYUP messages should be sent to the

	And in this case don't pass this messages to the base impl. Also hide
	the auto complete list box when displaying the drop down listbox.

	functionality to combobox.

2008-10-13  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	Append support to this controls. We need it to apply new patches.

2008-10-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Control.cs: When updating z order in child controls, send to back
	the implicit controls. Also, do it explicitly, instead of making
	GetAllControls return the implicit controls in a specific order, and
	thus avoid depending on that, which could change in the future.
	Fixes #434304.

2008-10-11  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Try to call Application.DoEvents before returning in a
	call to StartDrag, since we must fire DragDrop/DragLeave *before*
	that, as .net does - instead of firing DragDrop/DragLeave *after* the
	call to Control.DoDragDrop has completed. This is needed since at the
	point of returning, we have sent related dnd ClientMessages, but we
	need to wait for them to fire the wmf respective ones.

	drawing mode.  If we are top aligned, give ourselves some top padding.

2008-10-06  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* X11Dnd.cs: When firing the default dnd enter/leave events, fire the
	events on the control under the mouse pointer, instead of firing them
	on the window generating the dnd operation. To achieve this re-use the
	code used to get the window under the pointer when getting MouseMove
	events.
	Fixes #381876.

2008-10-06  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Don't check that that the window sending the dnd events
	is the owner of the selection. Although Gtk+ sets it that way, it's
	not a requirement of the XDnd protocol, and Qt doesn't seem to do it.
	So, just as Gtk+ does, we set our window sending the dnd events as the
	owner of the selection, but don't check it when receiving them. This
	should fix interoperability with Qt/Kde.
	Fixes #324251.

2008-10-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridViewCell.cs, DataGridViewColumnHeaderCell.cs,
	DataGridViewRowHeaderCell.cs: Remove PaintPartBorder and
	use PaintBorder instead.	

2008-10-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: When CellBorderStyle is set, update the
	AdvancedCellBorderStyle to match.

2008-10-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridViewCell.cs: Add helper methods to convert Alignment
	to TextFormatFlags and align rectangles.
	* DataGridViewTextBoxCell.cs: Use Alignment when painting text.
	* DataGridViewImageCell.cs: Use Alignment when painting the image.

2008-10-02  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* ToolTip.cs: Display tooltips only for controls on the active form.
	[Fixes bug #428115]

2008-10-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: Make OnCellValueNeeded internal.
	* DataGridViewCell.cs: Raise the CellValueNeeded event so the
	user can supply their own value if they choose.

2008-10-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridViewColumnHeaderCell.cs: Create a new style object
	so the DefaultCellStyle doesn't get changed.

2008-10-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: Check to make sure the owner is actually
	changing in InternalOwner before doing any work.  Fixes some
	failing tests.

2008-10-01  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridViewColumnHeaderCell.cs: Correctly calculate style.
	* DataGridView.cs: Use a column header's inherited style instead
	of just using the default.

2008-10-01  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* SplitContainer.cs: Raise SplitterMoved when the splitter is
	moved through code.

2008-10-01  Mario Carrion <mcarrion@novell.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs: Internal property added: UIAThumbPosition.

2008-10-01  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripOverflowButton.cs: Use InternalOwner instead of Owner.

2008-10-01  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: When the user sets Owner, we need to remove
	it from its previous owner and then add it to the new owner's
	item collection.  Also, create InternalOwner, so we can set the owner
	that doesn't do this new stuff.
	* ToolStripItemCollection.cs: Use InternalOwner instead of Owner.

2008-10-01  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: When our parent changes, recalculate our text
	size, since we may be getting our Font from our parent.  When our
	owner's Font changes, recalculate ourselves as we may be using
	that font.

2008-10-01  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Select the first option of a popup when opening the popup via
	return key. [Fixes bug #413792].

2008-10-01  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: Make Font, BackColor, and ForeColor be
	ambient properties.  (Get their value from their parents if
	values haven't been set.)

2008-10-01  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripSystemRenderer.cs: Call overridden methods' bases
	after our logic, so users can do painting by handling the events.
	Currently, we draw over any user painting.

2008-10-01  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripProfessionalRenderer.cs: Call overridden methods' bases
	after our logic, so users can do painting by handling the events.
	Currently, we draw over any user painting.

2008-09-30  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Prevent NRE when deactivate menu. Fixes #413636.

2008-09-30  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeNode.cs, TreeView.cs: Move logic that determines the node
	image to draw to TreeNode.  Give Index/Keys put on the node
	precedence over the global one for the TreeView.

2008-09-30  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Setting ImageIndex or ImageKey should reset the other.

2008-09-29  Mario Carrion <mcarrion@novell.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Index fixed.

2008-09-29  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TabControl.cs: When expanding the tab -because it's selected now-,
	using Right alignment, instead of adding some selected delta value to
	the X origin, substract it, so it gets a location adjacent to the panel, 
	instead of be more separated.
	Fixes #409170.

2008-09-29  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* MessageBox.cs: Use SystemIcons for graphics instead of keeping our
	own copies of them.

2008-09-29  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: source and related fields should be set to IntPtr.Zero,
	as well as the other static fields, to avoid using their previous
	values my mistake when handling the dnd events. This should avoid
	handling any status event after the drop has been finalized/cancelled.

2008-09-28  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: We have to send a dnd enter event as soon as we start the
	operation, instead of waiting until we get any movement - this will
	help us to have the data available in case no movement was detected
	and _still_ we have to fire DragEnter and DragLeave/DragDrop events.
	Finally add a windows.forms-only fallback to fire the mentioned events
	if no movement at all was detected, just like .net does.
	Fixes #381876.

2008-09-27  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: When drawing a status bar panel, don't
	return early if the text is empty because the icon doesn't get
	drawn then.  [Fixes bug #428113]

2008-09-25  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* FileDialog.cs: Implement basic support for sorting by columns in
	Details view. Patch by Eric Petit.
	Fixes #428006.

2008-09-25  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classis.cs: When drawing gridlines take into account the
	case where ListView.ItemSize hasn't been computed, and provide a
	fallback as well. This prevents a division by 0.

2008-09-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThemeVisualStyles.cs: Use ClientRectangle instead of Bounds to
	correctly draw tooltip backgrounds.

2008-09-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Change CopyTo implementation to ensure clones are
	created of our images.
	[Fixes bug #409169]

2008-09-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: When setting fonts, we need to ensure we change our
	reference to the new font object, even if it represents the same
	font as before.  If we don't, the original font can get disposed
	and we will still try to use it.
	[Fixes bug #386450]

2008-09-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Take into account Tile view when selecting the view
	(2.0 profile).

2008-09-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: When drawing gridlines for ListView don't use
	the item bounds, since we can't iterate over them in virtual mode.
	Also fix wrong calculation of the gridlines when using scrolling.
	Fixes #400390.

2008-09-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: When handling EnterNotify events, take into account
	both the public and implicit controls when trying to detect the
	grab/ungrab process. This should fix ListView selection in Details
	view.

2008-09-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Redraw the whole node area when the selected node changes.
	Things like state images were not getting redrawn because the invalid
	rectangle was too small.
	[Fixes bug #428211]

2008-09-23  Mario Carrion  <mcarrion@novell.com>

	* ListBox.cs: UIA Selection Pattern fully supported in ListBox control.
	[Fixes bug #428993]

2008-09-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Do not set the Form's icon in the backend if showicon = false.
	[Fixes bug #428114]

2008-09-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Allow tooltips to be multiline.
	[Fixes bug #427884]

2008-09-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* StatusBar.cs: Add tooltip support.
	[Fixes bug #428113]

2008-09-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Use StringAlignment.Center for the vertical
	alignments of sub items in Details view. Patch by John Mortlock (johnm at 
	hlaustralia.com.au).
	Fixes #425360.

2008-09-23  Neville Gao  <nevillegao@gmail.com>

	* StatusBar.cs: Add UIA event in AddInternal () to support accessibility.
	[Fixes bug #419079]

2008-09-22  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Set Text to "" instead of null in Clear().
	[Fixes bug #428107]

2008-09-22  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* ListView.cs: Don't do anything when EnsureVisible is called inside a
	BeginUpdate/EndUpdate block.
	Fixes #425049.

2008-09-22  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: The semantics for the public .ctor of
	ListViewSubItemCollection need us to already have a Text value for the
	item, which in our implementation have as available *after* adding the
	first sub item. So create an internal .ctor that satisfies our needs
	and let the public .ctor have the same semantics as .net.
	Fixes #427561.

2008-09-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* ListControl.cs: Changes in Formatting related values should call
	RefreshItems, as .net does.
	* ComboBox.cs:
	* ListBox.cs: In the respective overrides of RefreshItems calculate
	layout as well as refreshing - again, this is what .net does.
	Fixes #426168.

2008-09-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: In UpdateTopItem, don' call to XplatUI.ScrollWindow,
	since we are already doing that when we change the value of the
	scrollbar or force the call to ScrollWindow in the same method. This
	way we don't cause a Invalidate call for all the listbox bounds for
	methods calling UpdateTopItem with an already updated top item. This
	was happening specially calling EnsureVisible with already visible
	items.

2008-09-18  Mike Gorse <mgorse@novell.com>

	* Application.cs, IKeyFilter.cs, X11Keyboard.cs, XplatUI.cs,
	  XplatUIStructs.cs: Added KeyFilter
	[Fixes bug #427039]

2008-09-18  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* RelatedPropertyManager.cs: The properties returned by
	GetItemProperties should be that ones of the *actual* object returned
	by the property, not the property type - this is very special when the
	property exposes a type, but the returned object actually is a child
	class and implements more functionality and properties.

2008-09-18  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: Don't look for the property in the data source if the
	passed string is empty.

2008-09-18  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Comment out _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG in order to 
	fix unused variable warnings.

2008-09-18  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Send WM_HELP when F1 is pressed.
	[Fixes bug #427073]

2008-09-18  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: 
	 - Do not set _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG for modal forms, because this 
	 leads to the window manager overriding our border style and zorder. 
	 - Allow the activation of non-modal forms, which are children of a 
	 modal form.
	[Fixes bug #423417]

2008-09-17  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* XplatUIX11.cs, X11Structs.cs: For mapped windows SetTopMost should 
	ask the window manager to do the work instead of changing the property 
	directly.
	[Fixes bug #423417]

2008-09-17  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* CurrencyManager.cs: Check for positon before call ChangeRecordState in
	AddNew to fix some navigation for empty datasets. [Fixes #323053]

2008-09-17  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Remove OnPaint method on PopupButtonPanel and set 
	InternalBorderStyle to BorderStyle.Fixed3D. It is the best way to get 3d
	border and fixes some drawing issues when resize form.

2008-09-17  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Lots of layout fixes to mimic Win32. [Fixes #408752]
	
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: We don't need to reduce button size when it is
	AcceptButton.

2008-09-17  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: For standard textbox the scrollbars are always 
	visible if Multiline is true.
	[Fixes bug #426896]

2008-05-12  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs: Uncomment code accidentally commited in last
	patch.
	
2008-05-12  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	[Fixes most od DBNull and HeadersVisible problems]
	
	* DataGrid.cs:
	- ShowingColumnHeaders removed because we dont need it, ColumnHeadersVisible
	returns the value that we need.
	- Fixed FromPixelToColumn method that return zero for first	column and for
	row header cell, now it returns -1 for row header cell.
	- Fixed HitTest to check row header cell in column header area, it now
	returns HitTestType.None. [Fixes #322864]
	- Fixed the calculation of visible columns in UpdateVisibleColumn, now it
	checks for RowHeadersVisible and other things.
	- If an exception occurs when setting CurrentCell and user type 'yes' in
	message dialog, invalidade current and new cell and set setting_current_cell
	to false to prevent future errors. [Partially fixes #323050]

	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs: Don't call EndEdit after set property_descriptor
	value (SetColumnValueAtRow), it must be done by grid to properly show 
	messages. [Fixes #323050]

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Lots of fixes in DataGridPaintColumnHeaders to
	better draw column and row header. Also dont draw anything when column
	headers is not visible.

2008-09-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Hook ListViewItems into the ShowFocusCues
	logic.

2008-09-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Don't start editing a node on right click, only
	left click.

2008-09-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* NativeWindow.cs: Reenable the ThreadExceptionDialog I accidentally
	disabled over a year ago.
	* Form.cs: Wrap calling Load in a try/catch because it can happen
	before the catch-all one in NativeWindow.
	[Fixes bug #425414]

2008-09-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripDropDownMenu.cs: Calculate the connected area better
	to take into account when the drop down is not directly under the
	owner item.
	* ToolStripProfessionalRenderer.cs: Draw the whole unconnected area.

2008-09-16  Mario Carrion <mcarrion@novell.com>

2008-09-16  Mario Carrion <mcarrion@novell.com>

	* ErrorProvider.cs: Component enabled to support accessibility.
	* Application.cs: Updated to Initialize UIA in ErrorProvider.
	[Fixes bug #426459]

2008-09-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Flag has_been_focused when SelectionStart is set
	so we don't highlight on first focus.
	[Fixes bug #360869]

2008-09-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Correctly calculate the height of the area we 
	need to invalidate when we have started scrolling and viewport_y
	is used.  [Fixes bug #387608]

2008-09-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextControl.cs: When getting the SelectedText, don't add in
	NewLine characters, as they are already contained in the lines.
	[Fixes bug #388115]

2008-09-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Replace the buggy Lines setter with one that
	simply concats the lines and send it to the Text setter.
	[Fixes issue #2 and #3 of 388115]

2008-09-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: The default value of DataSourceNullValue should be
	Convert.DBNull actually. Also, the NullValue should only be used *if*
	itself is not null, and use the null/Convert.DBNull value instead.

2008-09-15  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Add a method to convert a string newline to the
	newline enum.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: When the user hits enter, insert a native newline.
	[Fixes part 1 of bug #388115]

2008-09-15  Mario Carrion <mcarrion@novell.com>

	* ToolTip.cs: UnPopup event set to internal to match public API.

2008-09-15  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: If the user is using Ctrl-Tab to move focus, we
	have to remove the Ctrl in order for the focus moving code to kick in.
	[Fixes bug #426170]

2008-09-15  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* CheckedListBox.cs: Return the real item index from Add.  It may not be
	the last item if the list is sorted.  The user can change the NewValue in
	the ItemCheck event, we need to use that value if so.
	* ListBox.cs: Return the real item index from a sorted Add.
	[Fixes bug #426166]

2008-09-15  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* MimeIcon.cs: Add null checks in the GnomeHandler, because it might 
	happen that the icons from the theme is missing or the particular size 
	unavailable.
	[Fixes bug #424981]

2008-09-15  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: When assigning null or DBNull depending on value/ref type,
	use IsValueType instead to get the precise desired value.
	Fixes #424276.

2008-09-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: When adding a new node to an opened node,
	we have to invalidate everything below the parent node because
	every node scoots down and we have to repaint them.
	[Fixes bug #411386]

2008-09-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Take CheckBox and RadioButton's CheckAlign
	property into account when drawing.
	[Fixes bug #416064]

2008-09-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: When calling Items.Clear(), call
	SelectedIndexCollection.ClearCore instead of normal Clear method, to
	not fire any Selected*Changed event - this is done to match .net and
	don't have invalid values when changing the DataSourceProperty.
	Fixes #424273.

2008-09-12  Mario Carrion  <mcarrion@novell.com>

	* HelpProvider.cs: Control enabled to support accessibility.
	* Application.cs: Updated to Initialize UIA in HelpProvider.
	[Fixes bug #425988]

2008-09-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Applied patch from John Mortlock that ensures
	TextChanged and SelectionChanged events fire in the same order as .Net.
	[Fixes bug #425725]

2008-09-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: When sorting a column, if it only contains numbers,
	do a numeric sort instead of a string sort.
	[Fixes bug #425849]

2008-09-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TableLayoutSettings.cs, TableLayoutStyleCollection.cs: Guard
	against NRE's when the settings have a null panel.
	* TableLayoutPanel.cs: When setting the TableLayoutSettings, ensure
	the panel gets set.
	[Fixes bug #425647]

2008-09-11  Mario Carrion  <mcarrion@novell.com>

	* ToolTip.cs: Control enabled to support accessibility.
	* Application.cs: Updated to Initialize UIA in ToolTip.
	[Fixes bug #425277]

2008-09-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Make the custom Enumerator internal to fix build.

2008-09-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridViewCheckBoxCell.cs: If our content is clicked and we aren't
	already in edit mode, begin edit mode.  Generally edit mode isn't
	started until the second click, but CheckBoxes are special.

2008-09-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ErrorProvider.cs: Never try to add our icons to ContainerControl,
	since that can be set to anything.  Always add them to the Control's
	parent.  [Fixes bug #416058]

2008-09-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ListView.cs: Use a custom enumerator for ListViewItemCollection
	so items can be deleted in a foreach.
	[Fixes bug #425342]

2008-09-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridViewRow.cs: Better implementation of GetPreferredHeight.
	Store the user set explicit height so that the row can be AutoSized
	and then when AutoSize is turned off, it can get its original size back.
	* DataGridView.cs: Use the Row's GetPreferredHeight instead of 
	duplicating the logic.  When setting AutoSizeRowsMode to None, reset
	rows' heights back to their explicit values.
	[Fixes bug #415780]

2008-09-11  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DateTimePicker.cs: When getting focus, select the checkbox if we are
	already showing it. Also, don't change its value when pressing space
	if the checkbox is not visible (ShowCheckBox as false). Finally, the
	checkbox should remain selected as long as Checked is false, and the
	other parts are disabled.
	Fixes #424267.
	
2008-09-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* MessageBox.cs: Handle shortcut keys to dialog buttons.
	[Fixes bug #425425]

2008-09-11  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: When the value retrieved from the control property is
	null, don't return Convert.DBNull for Nullable instances, since they
	can *actually* get a null value.
	Fixes #424265.

2008-09-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Add an internal field to force doublebuffering regardless
	of what the public mechanisms are set to.  This is because MS's native
	controls are doublebuffered even though their .Net bits are set to false.
	* ProgressBar.cs: Set force_double_buffer to true.
	[Fixes bug #406595]

2008-09-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridViewCheckBoxColumn.cs: Use the threestate constructor for
	the cell template.
	* DataGridViewCheckBoxCell.cs: Add proper support for threestate.
	* DataGridViewCell.cs: Implement GetEditedFormattedValue for types
	without EditingControls, paint background selection for types without
	EditingControls, reset the EditingCellValueChanged flag when the
	cell's value is committed.
	* DataGridView.cs: Make BeginEdit and EndEdit work with cells that don't
	have EditingControls, remove a double call to a cell's OnContentClickInternal,
	don't do cell changing logic in OnMouseDown if the cell didn't change.
	[Fixes bug #420351]

2008-09-10  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DateTimePicker.cs: Fix the edition of am/pm specifier.

2008-09-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Add "&" to the list of valid characters in a URL.

2008-09-09  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* DateTimePicker.cs: Before incrementing or decrementing any part in
	the textbox, end any current edit. Also when ending the current edit
	use the editing_part_index field instead of the current selected
	value, since they can be out of synch, and we really need to work on
	the *real* current edit part. Finally when PartData.Selected changes,
	always try to end any ongoing edit.
	This should fix some small errors handling mouse navigation and
	increase/decrease operations.

2008-09-09  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DateTimePicker.cs: 'hh' and 'HH' formats (12 and 24 hour formats
	respectively) should handled different, since the 12 hours format
	needs the value typed by the user to be adjusted depending on the
	a.m/p.m value, so it is preserved, and only changed when the value
	reaches the 12 value (when it changes from a.m to p.m).
	Fixes part of #416555.

2008-09-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Ensure MouseDown gets called for MenuStrip items.
	* ToolStripDropDownItem.cs: Don't fire events and such again if
	ShowDropDown is called on an already dropped down item.
	* ToolStripMenuItem.cs: Call ShowDropDown even if there aren't any
	subitems, the user may add some in the DropDownOpening event.
	[Fixes bug #417877]

2008-09-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Fix IOORE when setting SelectedItem to null.
	[Fixes bug #424270]

2008-09-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: When looking for menustrips on a child form to merge,
	look inside ToolStripContainers.
	[Fixes bug #424264]

2008-09-08  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* ErrorProvider.cs: Unbreak my previous commit.

2008-09-08  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* ErrorProvider.cs: Icon should always be 16x16.
	[Fixes bug #424380]

2008-09-07  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* GridEntry.cs: Invalidate the child items cache when the property 
	value changes.

2008-09-07  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* GridEntry.cs, PropertyGridView.cs: 
	   - Update the ReadOnly detection and rendering to finally hopefully 
	   match the one of MSFT.
	   - Niceify and move the debug CWLS.
	[Fixes bug #409028]

2008-09-05  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Don't call Invalidate at all from SetItemLocation,
	since we are already calling Invalidate for the entire control when
	needed - and call Redraw() when size changes, since we need to paint
	there by ourselved and not anymore from the mentioned method. 
	This should improve the layout process. Also clean some not needed calls 
	here and there.

2008-09-05  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Add a null check to the Alt-F4 code.
	[Fixes bug #420309]

2008-09-05  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThreadExceptionDialog.cs: Disable AutoScaling for this dialog.
	[Fixes bug #423040]

2008-09-04  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* GridEntry.cs, CategoryGridEntry.cs, RootGridEntry.cs, PropertyGrid.cs, 
	PropertyGridView.sc: Implement lazy/delayed propertygrid population 
	on item expansion. Improves performance and fixes bug #417955.
	[Fixes bug #417955]

2008-09-05  Stephane Delcroix  <sdelcroix@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: only check for OptimizedDoubleBuffer in NET_2_0.
	fix the build.

2008-09-04  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Add "_" to the list of valid characters in a URL.
	[Fixes bug #423408]

2008-09-04  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: If using OptimizedDoubleBuffer, ensure the clip 
	region gets set.
	[Fixes bug #414166]

2008-09-04  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* FontDialog.cs: When storing our font size from the starting font,
	use SizeInPoints instead of Size in case Size is a different unit
	from Points.
	[Fixes bug #416489]

2008-09-04  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: When enter is pressed on a SaveFileDialog and we
	don't use it for anything else, check if a directory is highlighted.
	If it is, navigate into it.
	[Fixes bug #422087]

2008-09-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: When acquiring a BindingManagerBase for the first time,
	check that the specified property actually exists in the data source,
	and throw an ArgumentException if that's not the case - this is only
	done for this scenario, since for later cases (such Position changes)
	we throw different exceptions (match .Net).

2008-09-03  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* ButtonBase.cs CheckBox.cs, Control.cs, FlowLayoutPanel.cs, 
	  FlowLayoutSettings.cs, GroupBox.cs, Label.cs, ListBox.cs, 
	  PropertyGrid.cs, RadioButton.cs, TableLayoutPanel.cs, 
	  TableLayoutSettings.cs, ToolStrip.cs, ToolStripDropDownButton.cs, 
	  ToolStripDropDownMenu.cs, ToolStripItem.cs, ToolStripSplitButton.cs, 
	  ToolStripStatusLabel.cs: Add missing PerformLayout calls to various 
	  properties.
	  [Fixes bug #418684]

2008-09-03  Neville Gao  <nevillegao@gmail.com>

	* StatusBar.cs: Control enabled to support accessibility.
	[Fixes bug #419079]

2008-09-02  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: When connecting the event handler for the "Changed"
	event for the property, only do it for PropertyManager, and not for
	CurrencyManager - this is exactly what does .Net, totally ignoring any
	change in the property of the elements of a list.
	Fixes the tests.

2008-09-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Ensure we never send the WS_EX_MDICHILD flag
	to Windows when creating a window, as we fake MDI stuffs.
	[Fixes bug #421858]

2008-09-01  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* TextBox.cs: Invalidate after UseSystemPasswordChar, so that the 
	change takes effect.

2008-08-24  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Provide MouseButtons/State information to the XPlatUI.
	[Fixes bug #419001]

2008-08-27  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: Raise CellContentClick event.
	[Fixes part of bug #420351]

2008-08-27  Mario Carrion  <mcarrion@novell.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs: Control enabled to support accessibility.

	[Fixes bug #416640]

2008-08-27  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Don't suppress the TextChanged event when changing
	the SelectedIndex.
	* ToolStripComboBox.cs: Listen to the ComboBox's TextChanged event
	and re-raise it.
	[Fixes bug #420673]

2008-08-26  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ErrorProvider.cs: Fix a regression NRE when setting properties
	for a control before it has a parent.
	[Fixes bug #420305]

2008-08-25  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: Use the BindingManagerBase.Current value to obtain
	connect the property "Changed" event, instead of using the data
	sources - this is useful when the property specifies actually a
	multiple objects path.
	Fixes part of #417973.

2008-08-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* RelatedPropertyManager.cs: PropertyManager instances associated to a
	nested properties should return not the properties of the data source
	itself, but the properties of the type of a specific property in the
	data source - match .net.

2008-08-24  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ListBox.cs (IntegerCollection): To avoid duplication, moved code for
	AddRange overloads into AddItems method, and added missing NULL check.
	Added extra argument check to RemoveAt for compatibility with MS. 
	Modified IList implementation of Add, Contains, IndexOf and Remove to
	throw an ArgumentException if item is not an int. Modified IList.Insert
	to throw a NotSupportException instead of an Exception. Implemented
	ICollection.
	(ObjectCollection): To avoid duplication, use AddItems method from
	AddRange overloads. On 1.0 profile, first perform NULL check on items
	in AddItems.

2008-08-23  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Control.cs: Do not modify bounds directly in .ctor's. Fixes bug
	 #419087.

2008-08-22  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* X11Keyboard.cs : comment out some Console.WriteLine().

2008-08-22  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* X11Keyboard.cs : fixed wrong call to XOpenIM() which happened
	  even if premises are not filled. Also XLookupString() was not
	  receiving correct input, which blocked precise input handling
	  on non-XIM mode.

2008-08-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* ListView.cs: When calling OnCacheVirtualItems, cast to the right
	type of delegate, instead of EventHandler - this was causing a type
	cast exception in all apps handling this event.
	Fixes #417876.

2008-08-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripDropDownItem.cs: Always raise DropDownOpening in
	ShowDropDown to give the user a chance to dynamically add
	drop down items.  [Step 1 of fixing bug #417877]

2008-08-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Don't fire pseudo motion DragOver events if we haven't
	had any mouse motion since the call to StartDrag, to match the dnd
	behaviour of .net.
	Fixes part of #381876.

2008-08-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Only do the children control bounds check for EnterNotify
	if mode is NotifyUngrab, and let it flow if mode is NotifyNormal.
	Also, if we are actually moving into a different window after
	grabbing, generate a LeaveNotify event for the previous window, since
	we need to fire the leave events until the grab ends, not when
	actually moving outside of the control.

2008-08-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: The check inside EnterNotify case to fire MouseEnter
	events only for client windows was wrong - we need to compare the
	client window against the window receiving the EnterNotify event, not
	against zero (since client window is never Zero, btw).
	This prevents having unnecessary handling of EnterNotify events for
	non-client windows when a gran begins.

2008-08-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Handling X ButtonPress events, we must *not* generate
	MouseMove/MotionNotify events at all (which should only happen after
	MouseUp/ButtonRelease, as .Net does).
	This avoids firing an extra and unnecessary MouseMove event just after
	every MouseDown event.

2008-08-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* LinkLabel.cs: Always clear any previous links when LinkArea
	is set.  [Fixes bug #410709]

2008-08-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripProfessionalRenderer.cs: Revert last change.
	* ProfessionalColorTable.cs: For Classic, use SystemColors.Window
	for ToolStripDropDownBackground.

2008-08-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripProfessionalRenderer.cs: Use Window color for the 
	background of dropdowns to match .Net when the user is not
	using the default white.  [Fixes bug #418108]

2008-08-19  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs : SetTimer() used to set wrong window handle and
	  it caused timer registration twice. Fixed bug #418107.

2008-08-18  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	[Correction: This is the actual change to X11Dnd issue, not the
	previous one, which was actually a different issue.]

	* X11Dnd.cs: Increase the interval for the Timer, to not fire our
	pseudo motion HandleMouseOver method so aggresive. Also, don't call it
	when the pointer is actually in motion, but only when the pointer
	seems to stop (as .net does).
	Fixes part of #381876.


2008-08-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Fix CopyTo implementation.
	[Fixes bug #409169]

2008-08-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Use ClientRectangle instead of Bounds when
	drawing a ComboBox's background.  Fixes bad disabled rendering when
	the control is not at 0,0.
	[Fixes bug #416063]

2008-08-16  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* GridEntry.cs: Leave the ICustomTypeDescriptor handling up to the 
	ComponentModel layer, which will properly prioritize the attributes.
	Avoids wrong prioritization of duplicate attributes when retrieving 
	the converter and editor.
	[Fixes bug #417729]

2008-08-15  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Increase the interval for the Timer, to not fire our
	pseudo motion HandleMouseOver method so aggresive. Also, don't call it
	when the pointer is actually in motion, but only when the pointer
	seems to stop (as .net does).
	Fixes part of #381876.

2008-08-15  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* GridEntry.cs: Perform stricter check for the ParentEntry's 
	PropertyDescriptor/PropertyOwner for the ICustomTypeDescriptor 
	implementation.
	[Fixes bug #417567]

2008-08-14  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* XplatUICarbon.cs: Properly implement PeekMessage and DoEvents.
	Fixes #396983.  Properly fix ActiveWindow trackin and do not
	prematurely show POPUP windows.

2008-08-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Handle the obscured regions while scrolling using
	GraphicsExpose event, processing it just after we copy the scrolled
	area. This ensures that the next calls to ScrollWindow will copy
	regions already updated, and the scrolling will be smooth. Also remove
	the code that was trying to detect the obscured regions, since we are
	not using it anymore (too slow).

2008-08-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Fix the -temporary- broken selection in ListBox for
	MultiExtended mode, by separating some logic between the ctrl/shift
	handling. Also ignore any MouseMove events generated together with
	MouseDown events - we are only interested in the real motion event.
	Fixes part of #414963.

2008-08-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridViewCell.cs: Guard against an AOORE when checking if a cell
	is selected.  [Fixes bug #414143]

2008-08-07  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* GridEntry.cs: Check if current property is a ICustomTypeDescriptor 
	and not the parent one (the propertyowner). Fixes the behavior of 
	GetConverter/GetEditor.
	[Fixes bug #415452]

2008-08-07  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* PropertyGrid.cs: Refresh should also repopulate the PropertyGrid.
	[Fixes part of bug #415452]

2008-08-05  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* GridEntry.cs: ITypeDescriptorContext should be relative to the parent 
	GridEntry, not the current.
	[Fixes bug #413896]

2008-08-04  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: De-internalize max_length field.
	* RichTextBox.cs: Use base.MaxLength - both TextBoxBase and RichTextBox 
	share the same logic.
	[Fixes bug #414454]

2008-08-03  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Selection changes made in the MouseDown handler should
	use the *Core versions of selection in SelectedIndices collection,
	since the SelectedIndexChanged/SelectedValueChanged events are fired
	until we get a MouseUp event, and thus we need to separate the logic
	from the events, as done in the keyboard navigation. Also, fire those
	selection events from keyboard navigation in SelectionMode.None, even
	if we don't have a selection, as .Net does.

2008-08-01  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripButton.cs, ToolStripMenuItem.cs: Guard against a NRE my
	last change introduced when an item is clicked but isn't on a toolstrip.

2008-07-31  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBindingHelper.cs: When looking for an object's properties, check
	if it implements ICustomTypeDescriptor, in which case we should
	resolve the propertu based on its GetProperties method, not in its
	actual properties. This is what .Net seems to do.
	Fixes a UsingWebBrowser problem during initialization.

2008-07-31  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Fix an NRE caused by clicking on a ToolStripButton
	sitting on a MenuStrip.

2008-07-31  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripButton.cs: If we "click" a top button on a menustrip that has
	no children with the keyboard, we need to release the keyboard capture.
	[Fixes bug #413567]

2008-07-31  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripMenuItem.cs: If we "click" a top level menu item that has
	no children with the keyboard, we need to release the keyboard capture.
	[Fixes bug #413567]

2008-07-31  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* ThemeVisualStyles.cs: Made ScrollBar rendering less strict so it supports
	the GTK+-based implementation of VisualStyles.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Exposed various layout values for use in the
	GTK+-based implementation of VisualStyles: ListViewGetHeaderHeight(Font),
	ListViewGetHeaderHeight(), ProgressBarChunkSpacing, ProgressBarGetChunkSize(),
	ProgressBarGetChunkSize(int), ProgressBarDefaultHeight,
	TrackBarGetThumbSize(), TrackBarVerticalTrackWidth,
	TrackBarHorizontalTrackHeight.

2008-07-31  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Added hot style handling for the scroll buttons.
	right_slider_state, left_slider_state are now of type PushButtonState to
	allow for a hot state. Added tracking of the mouse button being held down
	on a tab page. Extracted HasHotElementStyles, RightScrollButtonArea,
	LeftScrollButtonArea.
	* Theme.cs, ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Removed TabControlGetLeftScrollRect,
	TabControlGetRightScrollRect.

2008-07-30  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Check for null GrabControl on ProcessMnemonic to prevent 
	runtime errors.

2008-07-30  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* Form.cs: Ensure that we reset the shown_raised flag after 
	the form is closed, so that we raise the show events the next 
	time the form is shown.
	[Fixes bug #413141]

2008-07-30  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* Form.cs: Ensure closing events are raised only once.
	[Fixes bug #413143]

2008-07-30  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* X11Keyboard.cs: Refactor SendKeyboardInput to accept the keycode, 
	so that we can successfully generate the LParam in-place instead of 
	in KeyEvent, which isn't called for e.g. MainMenu. Fixes keyboard 
	navigation for menus.

2008-07-30  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: When montion don't set the keyboard navigation state to 
	'navigating'. Fixes bug #411356.

2008-07-30  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	[Fixed remaining issues of #406773 (#1)]
	* MenuItem.cs: UpdateMenuItem added to track the shotcut changes.

	* MenuAPI.cs: Don't create tracker on TrackPopupMenu, it will be created in
	MainMenu (already done) and ContextMenu creation.

	* ContextMenu.cs: Create tracker on construction. 

2008-07-30  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: For ContextMenu set GrabControl on TrackPopupMenu, it make
	possible to instantiate MenuTracker without GrabControl.

2008-07-30  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: On constructor dont set the GrabControl for non ContextMenu.

	* MainMenu.cs: Set GrabControl on SetForm using current form.

2008-07-30  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Chage grab_control to GrabControl and make it public.

2008-07-30  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Check if menu is activated before deactivate it in 
	ProcessShortcut.

2008-07-30  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* TableLayoutStyleCollection, TableLayoutStyle.cs, RowStyle.cs, 
	ColumnStyle.cs: 
	Make the TableLayoutStyle owned by the the TableLayoutPanel, so that:
	 - One style instance can only participate in a single style collection.
	 - Styles can request their owner to layout whenever their properties 
	 change.
	 [Fixes bugs #412583 and #412582]

2008-07-29  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* X11Keyboard.cs: Implement the generation of the LParam for 
	all keyboard messages.
	[Fixes bug #378728]

2008-07-29  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Don't let the user set TopIndex so high that it
	scrolls up far enough to show empty items.
	[Fixes bug #412728]

2008-07-29  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Actually commit the changes to fix #410880
	(I'm an idiot and forgot to commit the actual changes, as well as
	specify the right file, which is this one, not ListView.cs).

2008-07-28  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Don't draw ListViewSubItem instances from
	DrawListViewItem - we need to reuse the main item's drawing for the
	first sub item in case owner draw is true, but wants the system to
	do the default draw for the first sub item, without incurring in a
	recursion problem.
	Fixes #410880.

2008-07-28  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripButton.cs: Update Checked for CheckOnClick before
	raising the Click event.  [Fixes bug #412505]

2008-07-28  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* Form.cs: Remove some seems leftover code for non-TopLevel's 
	CreateParams, which is breaking ClientSize sizing, because it 
	removes the border window styles.

2008-07-27  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* PropertyGrid.cs: Invalidate the View when the PropertyTab 
	changes.

2008-07-25  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* WebBrowser.cs: Removed debug output.

2008-07-25  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Apply patch from Ernesto to clean up some
	dialog messages.

2008-07-25  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* TableLayoutPanel.cs: Perform layout on GrowStyle change, so 
	that the change has an immediate effect.

2008-07-25  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* ScrollableControl.cs: Update PerformLayout calls to include 
	provide the name of the property that changed.

2008-07-25  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* TableLayoutPanel.cs: Draw relative to the DisplayRectangle 
	location. Fixes drawing of border and cell borders if scrollable.

2008-07-25  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* ScrollableControl.cs: Perform layouting after the AutoScroll 
	properties have changed, so that the changes have immediate 
	effect.
	[Fixes bug #409090]

2008-07-25  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Non Client area is actually Client such in the 
	case of NotifyIcon, so double check WholeWindow == ClientWindow 
	when adding an expose.
	[Fixes bugs #324237 and #357022]

2008-07-25  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* TableLayoutPanel.cs: Invalidate after layouting, so that we 
	repaint the cell borders.

2008-07-25  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* PropertyGridTextBox.cs: Stop filtering messages prior to our 
	disposal to avoid unexpected ObjectDisposedExceptions.

2008-07-24  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* TableLayoutPanel.cs: Layout on Row/Column count change.

2008-07-22  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ListViewItem.cs: Changed binary serialization to match MS. Fixes
	bug #409351.
	* PictureBox.cs: When ImageLocation is set to null or an empty string,
	only set image to null if it was previously initialized from an url
	(or using ImageLocation). In ImageLocation, load specified image
	asynchronously if WaitOnLoad is false. Added support for local file
	paths to LoadAsync, and added missing argument check.

2008-07-22  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DateTimePicker.cs: 
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Add a editing capability to DateTimePicker, in
	order to set the value as required (which means: when selection
	changes for a part being edited, and not before that if not needed).
	Also use an enum to describe which part are we using, and use the
	selection as a property in PartData, in order to notify the
	DateTimePicker owner that we need to end the current edit.
	Fixes #383462.

2008-07-17  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* PropertyGridTextBox.cs: Validation should be performed only if we 
	are focused. We can lose focus for example if the Return key is used 
	to set the entry and there is an error. When the message box is 
	displayed we would have validate on click in the message box.

2008-07-16  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* GridEntry.cs: Checking for DesignerSerializaitonVisibility.Content 
	in order to determine that we are expandable is wrong. There was a bug, 
	now fixed, in TypeDescriptor that was causing the wrong converter to be 
	returned which caused GetPropertiesSupported == false in most cases.
	[Fixes bug #409027]

2008-07-15  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Fix ICollection.CopyTo implementation for
	ImageListCollection.  [Fixes bug #409169]

2008-07-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs, ToolStripDropDown.cs: Use VirtualScreen instead of
	WorkingArea so that menus can appear on the second monitor
	when one has dual monitors.

2008-07-14  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TextBox.cs: Auto complete stuff in WndProc should be 2.0 only.
	Fixes build.

2008-07-14  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TextBox.cs: Implement navigation support for auto complete in
	TextBox, as well as refactor the code to show the auto complete window
	when receiving a WM_CHAR message, instead of TextChanged, since
	autocomplete itself should be able to set the Text a lot of times and
	finally only typing should show it, not changes from code.

2008-07-14  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TabControl.cs: When expanding the selected tab, don't adjust the
	width if alignment is Right, since it has a different offset than 0,
	as opposed to the other alignments.
	Fixes the selected tab not being painted at all with alignment = Right
	and using FillToRight size mode.

2008-07-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Fix ToString to match MS.  [Fixes bug #409029]

2008-07-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* NumericUpDown.cs: Apply patch from Andy Hume to clamp out of range
	values from the textbox to the boundary values.  [Fixes bug #409026]

2008-07-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: We were copying one too many elements when
	doing our array copy.  Fixes a crash when RemoveAt is called.
	[Fixes bug #408999]

2008-07-14  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TabControl.cs: When doing the layout and need to call FillRow -using
	FillToRight size mode-, use the overload receiving a bool param
	indicating whether we need to do a vertical or horizontal calculation.
	Fixes part of #399583.

2008-07-13  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TextBox.cs: When painting, use the value returned by
	GetLastVisibleItem instead of using the cached last_item field, since
	there could be a desynchronization between the layout and the
	painting. Fixes a AOOR exception in auto complete mode.

2008-07-12  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* ThemeVisualStyles.cs: Disabled when Application.VisualStyleState is
	NonClientAreaEnabled until our VisualStyles is modified to allow it.

2008-07-12  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TextBox.cs: Fixed NRE in LostFocus. Avoid unnecessary initialization.

2008-07-11  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TextBox.cs: When focus is lost, if the auto complete listbox is
	visible, hide it.

2008-07-11  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* InternalWindowManager.cs: HandleSizing: Implemented a better minimum
	tracking size for tool windows.
	* Theme.cs, ThemeWin32Classic.cs : Extracted
	ManagedWindowSpacingAfterLastTitleButton.

2008-07-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThemeEngine.cs: Remove the clearlooks, nice, and old gtk themes.
	They are bit-rotted and have always been listed as "unsupported".

2008-07-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* PictureBox.cs: Don't crash if ImageLocation is set to "" or null.

2008-07-11  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* ThemeVisualStyles.cs: Fixed minimized window height adjustment.

2008-07-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Make sure last_item_visible gets reset before we try
	to do a layout due to scrollbars appearing or disappearing.
	[Fixes bug #408139]

2008-07-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* XPlatUIWin32.cs: Change GetMenuOrigin to calculate borders better
	for different window themes.  [Fixes bug #339140]

2008-07-10  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Implemented minimized window border width properly,
	in ManagedWindowBorderWidth.

2008-07-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Change MouseMove to take a point, so
	we can use the same point later on.
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Store point sent to MouseMove so we can
	later reset to it.  On Windows, the Cursor.Position had already
	changed by the time we were resetting to it.
	[Fixes bug #363239]

2008-07-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Ignore mouse actions on TitleButtons that
	are inactive.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Disable or hide MinimizeBox/MaximizeBox if
	user requested it.
	[Fixes bug #398686]

2008-07-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Double-clicking on the title bar should not
	maximize a MDI form if MaximizeBox = false.

2008-07-10  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* ThemeVisualStyles.cs: Fixed a warning.

2008-07-10  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* ThemeVisualStyles.cs: Fixed warnings and formatted.

2008-07-10  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* ThemeVisualStyles.cs: Removed ManagedWindowGetMenuButtonSize. The base
	implementation produces a better result.

2008-07-10  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* ThemeVisualStyles.cs: Adjusted height and border rendering for minimized
	windows.

2008-07-10  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* Application.cs: Added VisualStylesEnabled because XplatUI.ThemesEnabled
	cannot be used from the ThemeEngine constructor.
	* ThemeEngine.cs: Changed the XplatUI.ThemesEnabled check to
	Application.VisualStylesEnabled because it does not work on X11.

2008-07-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* StatusBar.cs: Apply patch from Andy Hume to remove lazy instantiation
	that we did not always check for, as well as fixes to the IList
	implementations.  [Fixes bug #402703]

2008-07-09  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* IDeviceContext.cs: Added Dispose.

2008-07-09  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* Control.cs: Added OnSizeInitializedOrChanged.
	* Form.cs: OnLoadInternal: Added a call to
	Control.OnSizeInitializedOrChanged.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs:
	 * HandleTitleBarMouseMove: No longer invalidates the parent window.
	 * DrawTitleButton: Extracted Theme.ManagedWindowDrawMenuButton.
	 * TitleButton: Added Entered.
	 * TitleButtons.MouseMove: Added handling of TitleButton.Entered.
	* MdiWindowManager.cs:
	 * HandleTitleBarMouseMove: Now invalidates the parent window when a mouse
	 move over the maximized title buttons causes a change.
	 * IsActive: Can now be called before the window is added to a MDI parent.
	* Theme.cs: Added ManagedWindowTitleButtonHasHotElementStyle,
	ManagedWindowDrawMenuButton, ManagedWindowOnSizeInitializedOrChanged.
	* ThemeVisualStyles.cs: Implemented proper managed window rendering.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	 * Extracted ManagedWindowDrawTitleBarAndBorders, ManagedWindowDrawTitleButton.
	 * DrawTitleButton takes a new form parameter.
	 * Added ManagedWindowTitleButtonHasHotElementStyle,
	 ManagedWindowDrawMenuButton, ManagedWindowOnSizeInitializedOrChanged.

2008-07-09  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* ThemeEngine.cs: ThemeVisualStyles is now selected if
	Application.EnableVisualStyles has been called, even if the current system
	configuration does not support rendering with Visual Styles.
	* ThemeVisualStyles.cs: Now falls back to ThemeWin32Classic when Visual
	Styles should not be used.

2008-07-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: PreferredHeight is not tied to ItemHeight.  Fixes 3rd
	ComboBox in FormsTest.

2008-07-08  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: (ManagedWindowBorderWidth): width 3 is only 
	for fixed toolwindows.

2008-07-08  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* Form.cs: SetBoundsCore: Added minimum size for minimized windows.

2008-07-07  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* Control.cs: CreateControl just returns if the Control is diposed 
	and doesn't throw ObjectDisposedException.
	[Fixes bug #406566]

2008-07-07  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* Control.cs: Do not create the control if the parent isn't created 
	yet, e.g in the case of a parented form on which .Show is called.
	It will be created when the parent is made visible/created.
	Improves #402446.

2008-07-07  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* Form.cs: Avoid recursively calling OnSizeChanged due to recursive 
	WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED caused by the layouting code on win32.
	[Fixes bug #406786]

2008-07-07  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* Form.cs: When disposed set owner to null. Improves #402446.

2008-07-07  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* Form.cs, FlowLayoutPanel.cs: When calculating the PreferredSize 
	use children's PreferredSize if in AutoSize mode and ExplicitBounds 
	if not.
	* Form.cs: Take the Padding into account for the PreferredSize.
	[Fixes bug #402849]

2008-07-07  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Since we don't support more than one direction in
	TabControl rows alignment (this is, the row becomes the
	bottom row when selected), make Direction return always 1. This way
	the layout doesn't get confused about a bad calculation.
	Fixes #399582.

2008-07-07  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Implement NC hit-testing for mouse down/up messages, 
	so that the wparam is properly set.
	Fixes form moving in the test case in bug 402446.

2008-07-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs: If we can't find the SelectedPath, display
	the full tree instead of nothing.  [Improves bug #406584]

2008-07-07  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Adjusted minimized window painting.

2008-07-07  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* InternalWindowManager.cs: No longer draws decorations for maximized MDI
	children.

2008-07-04  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Add a null check when using CollapseAll on an
	empty tree.  [Fixes bug #406449]

2008-07-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Make OnMenuComplete internal so we can call it.
	* MenuAPI.cs: Raise Form.MenuComplete when a menu item is clicked.
	[Fixes bug #399321]

2008-07-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Handle Up and Down keys when TabControl is in
	vertical alignment.
	[Fixes bug #399585]

2008-07-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Invalidate when we remove a tab.  Guard against
	an AOORE when trying to remove a tabpage that is not owned by the
	parent control.
	[Fixes bug #399927]

2008-07-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs: Change the LargeChange calculation to be correct.
	Ensure we are using LargeChange instead of large_change so we our
	calculations are correct.
	[Fixes bug #403122]

2008-07-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TableLayoutPanel.cs: When we change to a serialized TableLayoutSettings,
	we need to ensure the ColumnCount/RowCount gets set.
	[Fixes bug #404851]

2008-07-02  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: When handling item navigation, if selection mode is
	None, call EnsureVisible, since scrolling is normally handled by
	selection, that we are not calling in this case.
	Fixes #398345.

2008-07-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs: Apply a patch from Ernesto Carrea that adds
	a null check to our focus walking code.  [Fixes bug #394332]

2008-07-02  Andy Hume <andyhume32 at yahoo dot co dot uk>

        * ComboBox.cs: Case missed in bug 379596 "Support item
        navigation by entering text": On _close_ drop-down select
        the first item matching the text in the textbox.  [Fixes bug #397265]

2008-07-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: Fix a crash when sorting by column headers, 
	mentioned in bug #404841.  Remove some dead switch cases.

2008-07-01  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs:
	* TextBox.cs: Implement AutoComplete support for ComboBox, which just
	uses the AutoComplete support in the internal TextBox. Also TextBox
	can store a reference to ComboBox, in case AutoCompleteSource is set
	to ListItems (this is, ComboBox's items, and we don't want to pass an
	additional collection).

2008-07-01  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: Restore the initial value of bounds rect to
	Rectangle.Empty, and is this value for Layout detection in virtual
	mode. Fixes the tests.

2008-06-30  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* XPlatUI.cs: Remove references to "new" X11 backend.

2008-06-28  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* Control.cs: Add an internal virtual OnDragDropEnd method 
	to allow controls such as ListBox, which depend on a sequence 
	of MouseDown+Move+End events, to handle the lack of a MouseUp 
	when a DnD operation is started in MouseDown.
	* ListBox.cs: If a DnD operation is started in MouseDown we won't 
	get a MouseUp, so reset our state whenever a DnD operation ends.

2008-06-28  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* PropertyGrid.cs: Clear the root griditem first thing when 
	new object/s is/are selected. Fixes some rare cases where 
	the View will get a paint request and won't know that the 
	grid is in the process of repopulating.

2008-06-27  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* XplatUIX11.cs, InternalWindowManager.cs: 
	If WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW is set in the CreateParams for a form MS 
	doesn't automagically update the FormBorderStyle, so we must 
	double check the CreateParams explicitly to determine if the 
	window is a toolwindow.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Use InternalWindowManager.IsToolWindow 
	instead of doing custom checks.

	Fixes toolwindows for the test case in bug #402446

2008-06-27  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* Control.cs: Visibility of the control should be false 
	when the handle is destroyed in WmDestroy and not immediately 
	in Dispose(). This is effectively where the disposing process 
	ends even though the control is marked as Disposed immediately 
	after calling Dispose().
	[Fixes bug #402446]

2008-06-27  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* PropertyGridTextBox.cs: Start monitoring the mouse clicks 
	when the textbox gets focus.
	[Fixes bug #402704]

2008-06-27  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* PropertyGridTextBox.cs, PropertyGridView.cs: 
	 - Alt + Down should show the drop down editor.
	 - Focus the editor when showing it
	[Fixes bug #402710]

2008-06-25  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Fix from Andy for panel text for panels
	that are not the first panel.
	* StatusBar.cs: Ensure that the X coordinate of panels is always
	stored.  Fix IList implementation of StatusBarPanelCollection to
	call the regular methods.
	[Fixes bug #403599, #402165]

2008-06-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Fix position calculation for centered
	text on status bar panels.  [Fixes bug #402165]

2008-06-22  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* Splitter.cs: Fix Splitter to:
	 - Work for arbitrary splitter size
	 - Handle MinSize and MinExtra properly
	 - Get rid of absolute positioning during drag and use relative
	 - Multiple other fixes 
	 [Fixes bug #338966]

2008-06-22  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* Cursor.cs: Show shouldn't hide the cursor.

2008-06-21  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: When invalidating, add some extra space to bounds,
	since focus rectangle and selection can add some space and need to
	take into account those small offsets - specially in Details view.
	* ListView.cs: Instead of invalidate using item Bounds directly, call
	item.Invalidate, to have the code centralized.
	Fixes focused/selection garbage when selecting and deselecting items
	that are close.

2008-06-21  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: Set bounds initially to -1 values - thus in virtual
	mode we can check whether we have to force a Layout or not, and can
	cache based on this, instead of avoiding caching all the the time. Do
	this check in GetBounds and TextBounds.
	Fixes selection in Details view.

2008-06-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Make HeaderControl internal, thus the theme engine can
	get its *real* height instead of trying to infere it.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: When drawing gridlines, don't iterate over the items to
	get the position of them, since it's in general a bad idea in general,
	and because we can't do that in virtual mode. Instead get the first
	visible item as well as item height, and draw them.
	Fixes #400390.

2008-06-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripSplitButton.cs: We can't add in extra width if
	the button is not AutoSize.  [Fixes bug #401279]

2008-06-20  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* PaddingConverter.cs: 
	 - Implement conversion to InstanceDescriptor
	 - Handle "All" in CreateInstance by using the supplied 
	 ITypeDescriptorContext.
	 [Fixes bugs #396076 and #396078]

	Add Category attributes.
	Code is contributed under the MIT/X11 license.

2008-06-18  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* Form.cs: 
	 - Fix a NRE when unparenting a form.
	 - Do not recreate or destroy a parented form when 
	unparenting. 

2008-06-18  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TextBox.cs: Implement basic support for AutComplete with custom
	sources.

2008-06-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripSplitButton.cs: Left and Top of ButtonBounds, SplitterBounds,
	DropDownButtonBounds should be from the origin of the button, not the
	ToolStrip.  [Fixes bug #401279]

2008-06-16  Sandy Armstrong <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com> 

	* X11DesktopColors.cs: Clear GTK_MODULES environment variable before
	  running gtk_init_check.  This prevents GAIL from loading
	  unnecessarily, which was breaking UIA support.  Initial fix for bug
	  #375987.
	* Application.cs: Add UIA support to Winforms.  New static constructor
	  uses reflection to initialize UIAutomationWinforms assembly.  Added
	  PreRun event so UIA can initialize before the mainloop starts, and
	  FormAdded event so UIA can provide a11y support for new Forms in an
	  Application.

2008-06-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: When binding to a dataset, subscribe to table
	and column change events.  Unsubscribe to these when we clear bindings.
	[Fixes bug #399601]

2008-06-14  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	[DataGrid drawing refactory]

	* DataGrid.cs: Fix the caption size, we need one pixel more for divider.

	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs: Removing PaintHeader code, the draw operations
	must be handle by Theme, now it call DataGridPaintColumnHeader.

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs: Fix the textbox size. It must be one pixel less,
	test cases must be also fixed because it checks for wrong size.

	[Fixes bug #399601]

2008-06-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: We need to call RaiseSelectionChanged pretty
	much any time the caret moves and there is text, not just when
	the selection changes as one would think.
	* RichTextBox.cs: Override RaiseSelectionChanged and fire
	SelectionChanged.
	[Fixes bug #397271]

	subtract the selected text length (the text we will be replacing) from
	the document length.
	* TextControl.cs: Ensure every character insertion is reflected in
	charcount, so max length will work properly.
	[Fixes bug #398605]

2008-06-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Ensure scrollbars are updated when a single

2008-06-10  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: When SelectionMode is None, clicking an item should move focus
	as well as generating a SelectedIndexChanged event, just like .Net does
	-surprise-.
	Fixes #398345.

2008-06-10  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: When navigating items visually, use FocusedItem as the
	reference point instead of SelectedIndex, since even in
	SelectionMode.None we need to support navigation, and in that case we
	just can't use SelectedIndex.
	Fixes part of #398345.

2008-06-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Make a SetBoundsInternal that avoids the new
	SetBounds code.

	true- with ComboBoxStyle.Simple, set the height to PreferredHeight
	if the requested height leaves the listbox area with *less* than the

	even for values matching the height for a single item.
	Fixes #396297.

2008-06-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridViewCell.cs: Simplify GetInheritedStyle by using ApplyStyle.

	in 64 bit machines.

	* DataGridViewCell.cs: Correctly get converters for FormattedValue.

	ApplyStyle the rest.

2008-06-05  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: We need to calculate the scrollbars even if the handle
	hasn't been created - this is needed when methods using scrollbars

	Fixes #397272.

2008-06-05  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

2008-06-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: I'm an idiiot - forgot to commit the last ComboBox
	section. Also, when setting bounds, snap height as well as save the
	requested height if Dock has any value affecting the height: Left,
	Right and Bottom - important if using IntegralHeight as true.

2008-06-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: When calling UpdateComboBoxBounds, adjust the height
	passed to SetBounds to reflect the new adjusted height (Integral-wise), 
	instead of doing that only in our SetBoundsCore override, since the 
	bounds cached can be the same as saved one and we could not get the
	new height applied.

2008-06-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: If the combobox is anchored both on top and bottom,
	adjust height if IntegralHeight is true when calling SetBoundsCore (as
	likely the height was modified even if Height wasn't specified in

	* GridEntry.cs: Make HasCustomEditor check for EditStyle != None

2008-05-02  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: page_size as well as vscrollbar.LargeChange should be 1

	we have more than one item but we are only partially showing 1 item.
	Fixes part of #374713.

2008-05-02  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* XplatUiX11.cs: When scrolling and detecting the obscured areas in a

	been created or isn't visible, as well as avoiding creating the parent
	Form if the handle hasn't been previously created.
	Fixes tests.

	container form.
	Fixes some tests.

2008-05-01  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Properly detect the visible area of a control being
	scrolled (obscured by other winforms controls and any X toplevel
	windows), to mark as invalid the requested area to be scrolled that
	isn't visible and thus can't be copied.
	Fixes #324513.

	* ComboBox.cs: Use ListBox-like scrollbar values In ComboListBox 
	to avoid setting an invalid value for the verticall scrollbar 
	when navigating items. And, duh, also remove my silly debug messages
	from previous commits.
	Fixes #374713.

	Fixes #369048.

	down button style.

2008-05-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	also *try* to move by one item if the computed offset is negative,
	just like the PageUp case.

2008-05-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: When navigating using PageDown/PageUp the navigation

2008-05-22  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* X11Keyboard.cs : set XIM font size to somewhat reasonable

	the ToolStripItem's TextChanged.  [Fixes bug #393597]

2008-05-21  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TabControl.cs: When invalidating in SelectedIndex and we need to
	inflate to take into account the border of the tabs, make sure that
	the invalidated rect doesn't overflow the control bounds, since that
	would avoid updating at all.

2008-05-21  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Don't substract scroller width from the row width,
	since we need to take into account the total width of the control when
	calculating the position of the tabs. This avoids showing scroller
	when it is actually not needed.
	Fixes part of #322325.

2008-05-21  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* ThemeVisualStyles.cs: Added support for TextBoxBase.

2008-05-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Remove invalidating implicit child controls when

	controls with implicit scrollbars.
	* ListView.cs: Listen to the Invalidated event and invalidate
	child controls.

2008-05-20  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com> 

	* WebBrowserBase.cs, WebBrowser.cs: Hook up page loading events
	* HtmlDocument.cs: Check for nulls

2008-05-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Control.cs: In ControlCollection.RemoveInternal, remove the
	internal control before calling PerformLayout and OnControlRemoved,
	which was leaving us in an invalid state and causing a X error (bad
	match). Observe that Remove () call has the same order.
	Fixes an X error changing ComboBoxStyle.DropDownStyle.

2008-05-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Don't paint by ourselved and instead let OnPaint
	being fired if ControlStyles.UserPaint style is activated.
	Fixes #371905.

2008-05-19  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* GridEntry.cs: Don't be so strict when setting the value - 
	do not check if what we set is what we get.

2008-05-19  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: If there are no timers timeout should be 0

	* TextRenderer.cs: Included some methods in the 1.1 profile.

2008-05-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: When we make a control visible, it may have been
	previously visible and while it wasn't visible, the z-order of
	things may have been shuffled, so the control needs to have its
	z-order updated just in case.  [Fixes bug #391518]

2008-05-19  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* ThemeVisualStyles.cs: Added support for GroupBox.

2008-05-19  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs, X11Keyboard.cs : redoing r103060 with fix for
	  bug #389996; XSelectInput() behaved as mouse handler robber,
	  so remove extra call to it.

2008-05-15  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Simplify ControlCollection.Contains method.

2008-05-15  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

2008-05-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Use long instead of int when handling WParam from
	mousewheel scrolling.  Int was overflowing on Win64.

2008-05-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* FlowLayoutPanel.cs, ScrollableControl.cs: We need to layout the
	flow panel without scrolling first, and then calculate the 
	scrolling based on the new layout.  [Fixes bug #390149]

2008-05-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Invalidate after scrolling up when selected index
	changes.  [Fixes bug #390151]

2008-05-13  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: When setting mode to Simple *and* height hasn't been
	set, default height to 150. I tried first with DefaultSize, but this
	is not generating a SetBoundsCore call before handle creation time, so
	we can take it into account. This is just what .net does.

2008-05-13  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs, X11Keyboard.cs: Had to revert eno's r103060,
	as it broke some stuff.  Calberto is filing a bug for eno to
	work with.

2008-05-13  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: When handling PageDown pressed event, set SelectedIndex
	to 0 is the current value is -1, and if style is not Simple, just
	return, like .net does.
	Fixes part of #374713.

2008-05-13  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs, ThemeVisualStyles.cs: When calculating
	progress bar stuffs, use doubles instead of ints to prevent
	overflow.  [Fixes bug #389798]

2008-05-13  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs, X11Keyboard.cs :
	  Significant refactoring on XIM support. Now IM engine UI
	  should show up, at mostly-correct preedit position.
	  - Eliminated use of FocusWindow, as it is never mapped
	    and hence blocks correct preedit position. XIC is now
	    created per window, and it must be destroyed too when
	    the window is destroyed.
	  - WM_QUIT messages should not be filtered even when hwnd
	    is zombie. Filtering it could cause endless loop.
	  - Preedit position must move only when the window is alive.
	  - Make it IDisposable and make sure to release XIM/XICs.

2008-05-13  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Timer.cs, Control.cs, Form.cs, ApplicationContext.cs,
	  XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs :
	  fix for bug #325033 and #387693;
	  - WM_QUIT should not be sent when no running application
	    exists.
	  - SetTimer/KillTimer (especially on win32) should be
	    invoked for the window that the timer is/will_be attached.
	  - There could be unattached timers to a window when it's
	    started. For those timers, hold pending timers and when
	    a window is mapped, attach them to it.
	  - WaitForHwndMessage() could run into loop when
	    WM_SHOWWINDOW is handled before this method is called.
	    So, strictly check wm_showwindow state.
	  - Tick handler should not be invoked while one Tick handler
	    call is still running (introduced Busy state).

2008-05-13  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com> 

	* WebBrowserBase.cs: Override Internal alternative methods for
	  SetBoundsCore and OnResize instead of the protected ones.
	* Control.cs: Move SetBoundsCore and OnResize implementations to
	  SetBoundsCoreInternal and OnResizeInternal, so they can be
	  overriden internally (WebBrowserBase needs to catch them but can't
	  override the protected methods without api compat problems)

2008-05-13  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com> 

	* WebBrowserBase.cs: Hiding away non-public overrides for api compat

2009-05-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs:
	* ListView.cs: Remove debug messages.

2008-05-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Don't do any calculation for simple mode if the listbox
	area is empty. Also calculate scrollbars in Simple mode based in area
	height and total number of items, not in MaxDropDownItems.
	Fixes part of #371991.

2008-05-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* PictureBox.cs: Always invalidate on resize.  Fixes an app for jhill.

2008-05-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

2008-05-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* HtmlWindowCollection.cs: Should not be sealed.

2008-05-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Always draw the scrollbar area under the thumb
	button, because the thumb button will not get drawn if the scrollbar
	is disabled.  [Fixes bug #389262]

2008-05-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Handle End key for multi-column listboxen.

	* ListBox.cs: There is always at least one column in the ListBox.
	[Fixes bug #389250]

2008-05-10  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: When handle is created call UpdateComboBoxBounds to
	ensure in Simple mode that the height is exactly the requested one.
	Also add the ComboBoxListControl to the controls collection in Simple
	mode even if handle hasn't been created.
	Fixes part of #371991.

2008-05-10  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: For ComboListBox control -specially in Simple mode-, give focus to
	our ComboBox owner instead of giving it back to the previous control (
	as done in other controls). Also remove the empty override of Select
	method, since we want to be selected *and* give focus to our owner.
	This should let the user do keys-navigation in Simple mode. 

2008-05-10  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* XplatUICarbon.cs: Dont use HIViewScrollRect as it's causing painting
	problems with rapid scrolling of treeviews. Fixes #381084

2008-05-10  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* XplatUICarbon.cs: Deactivate the active window before

	* MimeIcon.cs: Provide a way to get icons from resources.

2008-05-08  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: When the value retrieved from the control to be assigned
	to the data source is null, actually use the 2.0 DataSourceNullValue
	value. Make pass a data binding test.

2008-05-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: We need to invalidate implicit children even when
	invalidate is called with invalidatechildren = false.  (Implicit
	children are really part of the parent.)
	* ListView.cs: Double-buffer internal child controls for less
	flicker.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Remove an extra nested loop in drawing
	owner ListView subitems for greatly increased performance.
	[Fixes bug #388477]

	* ListBox.cs: Respect checkboxes when measuring item size.
	* ThemeWin32Classis.cs: When drawing list items, don't draw
	text outside of the item's bounds to prevent overlapping.
	(.Net actually overlaps, but that's just silly.)
	[Fixes bug #388117]

2008-05-08  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* NotifyIcon.cs: Call SetForegroundWindow before show context menu. Thanks

	* ListView.cs: Ouch, forgot to commit.

2008-04-26  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Fire the -until now- forgotten CacheVirtualItems event.

2008-04-26  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When calculating box selection for virtual mode, don't
	look for intersection with item's text, but item bounds, since that
	would mean read ListViewItem's text for _every_ item, and that's
	something we just can't do in virtual mode (items are only requested
	when drawn).

2008-04-26  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* ThemeVisualStyles.cs: Added support for ControlPaint.DrawCaptionButton and
	partial support for managed windows (based on the patch from Ernesto).

2008-04-25  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When doing a key search use FindItemWithText method
	instead of doing the search by ourselves, this way we avoid
	duplicating the code and also we handle the special case for virtual
	mode. To achieve that make our private overload of FindItemWithText
	internal and also have a 'roundtrip' parameter.

2008-04-25  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When doing the layout don't request the
	ListViewItem instance if we are in virtual mode (since we can't request it
	until the item is actully drawn).

2008-04-25  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

2008-04-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	they refer to.  It isn't the way the MS does it, but its better
	than what we were doing.  See bug #368587.

2008-04-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* InputLanguage.cs, InputLanguageCollection.cs: Apply patch
	from Eric Albright that lazy loads the input language as ensures

2008-04-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Don't use ToolStripControlHosts when figuring up
	implicit mnemonics.  [Fixes bug #383000]

2008-04-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: When canceling the operation, automatically restore the
	default cursor - normally the default cursor is restored when the
	mouse buttons are released, but we should be able to restore it even
	if the buttons are still pressed (for example, when pressing ESC to
	cancel).
	Fixes #381894.

2008-04-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: When starting a new drad and drop operation, set control
	field to null, just as the other fields, to avoid calling any
	operation on a previous control. Also, when calling DndLeave on a
	control, set it to null, thus we don't fire that event multiple times
	for that control.
	Fixes #209264.

2008-04-23  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* XplatUICarbon.cs: Ensure that we have a valid hwnd before accessing

2008-04-22  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridViewRowHeaderCell.cs: Fill in some NIEX stuff.

2008-04-22  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	scrollbars, invalidate the whole thing.
	[Fixes bug #382001]

2008-04-21  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Calling Sort() sets Sorted = true.

	if the nodes need to be sorted.
	[Fixes bug #382028]

2008-04-21  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* Form.cs: Fire SizeChanged for both when the form is minimized and 
	restored.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Instead of tracking minimization on UnmapNotify track it 
	on PropertyNotify of _NET_WM_STATE. Much much cleaner.

2008-04-21  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: If the combobox is disabled, draw a disabled
	background before painting anything else.
	[Fixes bug #381729]

2008-04-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Wehn the drag and drop operation is cancelled don't
	forget to send a Leave event to the target window - just as .net does
	when cancelling dnd operations.

2008-04-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Stop tracking messages as part of the dnd operation as
	soon as possible - this happens when we send the drop message to the
	target window. This way we avoid firing any DragOver _after_ drop finished.
	Fixes #378179.

2008-04-20  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Send WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED when a toplevel is minimized.
	* Form.cs: Handle form minimization as a special state, where size doesn't 
	change, but we have to fire SizeChanged.
	[Fixes bug #325122 for the win32 and x11 backends]

2008-04-20  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Win32 doesn't send WM_(KILL|SET)FOCUS 
	if the handle is disabled.
	[Fixes bug #371751]

2008-04-20  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	for forms with FormBorderStyle.None.

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Implement support for WM_ENTERSIZEMOVE and 
	WM_EXITSIZEMOVE.
	[Fixes bug #346529 for the X11 backend]

2008-04-19  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: 
	  - Send a mouse Enter message after say dragging the mouse with a 
	  button down and then release it in another client.
	  - Reset the cursor to prevent X11 from remembering it and setting it 
	  before the control gets WM_SETCURSOR.
	  - Qeueue a mouse move after a mouse enter like win32.
	  [Fixes bug #323234]

2008-04-19  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Implement limited support for WM_SYSCOMMAND.

	well as do the proper layout based on display indexes for that view
	too.

2008-04-18  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Focused item information is now stored as a display
	index, and display indexes are used all over the place for selection,
	instead of ListViewItem.Index values, which doesn't give us enough
	information to modify the selection in groups mode, and was broken.

2008-04-18  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* Control.cs: Do not fire MouseDown if validation of the control has 
	failed.
	* Form.cs: Validate the form before closing.
	[Fixes bugs #330501 and #353310]

2008-04-18  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com> 

	* WebBrowserBase.cs: Added WndProc, DrawToBitmap,
	  CreateWebBrowserSiteBase implementations
	* HtmlElement.cs: Add missing OuterHTML, OuterText setters, stubbed
	  Style and TabIndex setters

2008-04-18  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewGroup.cs: When returning the actual item count, return the
	proper count for default group.
	Fix the tests.

2008-04-18  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs:
	* ListViewGroup.cs: When calculating groups layout, get the actual
	number of items per group, since groups added to the group BUT not
	added to the ListView are just ignored, and can cause some nasty
	exceptions because of the lack of synchronization. Also for
	ListViewGroup don't use lazy initialization for items, since we 
	the common scenario is to use it always - and it helps us to  refactor
	and clean the .ctor overloads.

2008-04-18  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When adding an item to a ListViewItemCollection
	belonging to a group (ListViewGroup.Items), don't generate a redraw if
	the added item hasn't beeen previously added to the ListView instance
	refered by the group, since it will be ignored. This should avoid some 
	really nasty flickering.

2008-04-17  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When accessing an item in a specific display
	position, use the helper method GetItemAtDisplayIndex, instead of
	direct access to the reordered_items_indices array. When doing layout
	for groups set the correct Items index for the display position (since
	in groups mode items don't have the same position as in Items
	collection).
	* ListViewGroup.cs: Add a field to store the starting item number,
	which is later used when calculating the layout.

	Fixes #360805.

2008-04-17  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Application.cs: Fixed ProductVersion to fallback to the assembly
	version. Fixes regression for bug #325413.

2008-04-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: New helper method to retrieve an item in a _specific
	display_ position (the items can be displayed in a different order
	than one of Items collection).
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: When drawing, instead of iterating over Items
	collection, use ListView.GetItemAtDisplayIndex, to get an item in a
	specific display position (again remember that items can be sorted
	different than Items).

2008-04-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridViewColumnCollection.cs: Create a cached copy of our sorted
	list and update it when the collection changes.  We were recreating
	this several times per row paint and for every pixel the mouse moved
	across the grid.
	* DataGridViewColumn.cs: Regenerate cached sorted list when DisplayIndex
	changes.

2008-04-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridViewColumnCollection.cs: Convert our internal sorted columns
	list to use generics.
	* DataGridView.cs, DataGridViewRow.cs: Use generic sorted column list
	and remove unneccessay casts.

2008-04-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridViewBand.cs: Add internal way to set displayed variable.
	* DataGridViewRow.cs: Don't paint cells in non-displayed columns.
	* DataGridView.cs: Make sure we always keep track of Displayed
	rows and columns, and only draw things that are displayed.

2008-04-16  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* X11Keyboard.cs, XplatUIX11.cs : manage key state regardless of
	  whether the key events are filtered or not. Introduced
	  PreFilter() process for this purpose. This fixes atokx3/iiimx
	  shift state issue.

2008-04-16  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com> 

	* HtmlHistory.cs: Implement Length property

2008-04-15  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: Call EndEdit when a sort is performed so we take
	away the edit textbox.  Refactor to reuse column sort code.

2008-04-12  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Remove the code that save and restore capture status of 
	grab_control, this fixes some Menu and Context menu bugs but maybe it can
	cause some others, I cant figure the possible problems of this patch but
	right now remove the code looks to be better than keep it. This patch fixes
	bugs #357638, #378721 and #379570.

2008-04-12  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com> 

	* HtmlDocument.cs, HtmlElement.cs, HtmlHistory.cs, WebBrowser.cs:
	Implement OuterHtml, OuterText, Enabled, Scroll*, *Rectangle properties,
	add missing properties and event handlers.
	
2008-04-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Make sure the LargeChange we are setting is at least
	zero, to prevent an IOORE.  [Fixes bug #379531]

2008-04-13  Andy Hume <andyhume32@yahoo.co.uk>

	* ComboBox.cs: Support item navigation by entering text.  Firstly, 
	in DropDownList mode, for each key-press select the next item 
	starting with that letter.
	For other modes, when no item selected, on arrow-up/-down and open 
	drop-down select the first item matching the text in the textbox.

2008-04-14  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* X11Keyboard.cs : Control.FromHandle() could return null
	  in MoveCurrentCaretPos().

2008-04-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When changing the size in VirtualMode, also Reset the
	selection.
	* ListViewItem.cs: Don't call SelectedIndexCollection.Reset when
	changing selection info for VirtualMode.
	Fixes #372618.

2008-04-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: When drawing ListViewItem instancesin Details
	view, don't use LineLimit for the first item - use NoWrap *always*
	instead, since ListView.LabelWrap is not used for this view.
	Fixes #378054.

2008-04-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: Call UpdateIsBinding when setting control - probably
	Binding is already usable and we don't need to wait to check the
	IsBinding state. Also for 1.1 profile use IsHandleCreated instead of
	Created, just like 2.0 does.
	* CurrencyManager.cs: I'm so lame - the previous check was wrong.

2008-04-11  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: Just realized we don't need to have a handler for
	BindingContextChanged, since this info should be now consumed directly
	in the BindingManagerBase. And also, the manager.IsBindingSuspended
	state info is checked directly, instead of caching it.

	* CurrencyManager.cs: IsSuspended should return always false if Count
	== 0.

2008-04-11  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: When calling PushData, return if manager.Count == 0,
	since we just don't have data to be read. Also, when setting the
	Control for binding, hook up some events to refresh the IsBinding
	state when BindingContext change or control gets created; use
	Control.IsHandleCreated instead of Control.Created check to set
	IsBinding state - we *actually* need to modify IsBinding when control
	is created, but we don't have any Created event, only HandleCreated.
	Fixes part of #349364.

2008-04-11  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* XplatUICarbon.cs: Expose Caret to the Carbon layer.  Guard against

	value in ListView drawing code.

2008-04-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	is clicked.  Respect the user setting Cancel in FileOk.

2008-04-11  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: Avoid setting and resetting control Width/Heights and
	calculate the final value and set it once.  Prevents a feedback loop
	on the mac.

2008-04-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Clamp setting the scrollbar value using SafeValueSet.
	[Fixes bug #378869]

2008-04-10  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* X11Keyboard.cs, X11Structs.cs : make over-the-spot mode default.
	  Add some on-the-spot code, but it seems we don't need it.

2008-04-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Add method for DataGridView to trigger focus cues
	even when it handles the tab keypress.

2008-04-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: More keyboard handling, tab, esc.
	* DataGridViewTextBoxEditingControl.cs: Don't request arrow keys
	when at the beginning or end of the text in the text box.

2008-04-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridViewCell.cs: Guard against an NRE causing a test to fail.

2008-04-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* PictureBox.cs: Call Load when ImageLocation is set.
	[Fixes bug #378308]

2008-04-09  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* X11Keyboard.cs, XplatUIX11.cs :
	  Implement over-the-spot mode (with some odd offsets).
	  - set preedit position when caret is set.

2008-04-08  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* X11keyboard.cs: Fix last patch, maxval must be less not greater than
	array lenght.

2008-04-08  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	and ScanTableIndex public, it fix compilations errors when compiling
	WinForms to generate keyboard layout resources.

2008-04-08  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* X11keyboard.cs: Prevent keyboard errors when vitual table theres 
	different element count than scan table. It prevents some errors in non
	standard keyboards.

2008-04-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridViewHeaderCell.cs: Implement some NIEX methods.

2008-04-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* BindingContext.cs: Stub UpdateBinding method.

2008-04-07  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

        * X11Structs.cs : added couple of structs for XIM support.
        * X11Keyboard.cs :
          Release XIM in case it failed to create XIC. 
          Use consts for XNblah string.
          Add support for IM style customization and XIC creation
          for preedit-position and preedit-callback.
          Right now use MONO_WINFORMS_XIM_STYLE environment variable
          (list of: over-the-spot | on-the-spot | root). Only root
          mode works so far.

	  (redoing r99172 with fix.)

2008-04-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Center the checkbox a little better.

	* BindingSource.cs: Implement GetRelatedCurrencyManager by adding a
	Dictionary containing the related (child) currency managers. Also,

	TypeConverter and UITypeEditors.

2008-04-04  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	[Fixes bug #375789]

2008-04-02  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* BindingContext.cs: When retrieving a BindingManagerBase, if the
	dataSource parameter is ICurrencyManagerProvider, then return
	ICurrencyManagerProvider.CurrencyManager/GetRelatedCurrencyManager
	instead of creating a new one.

2008-04-02  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* BindingSource.cs: Implement support for Type instances as
	DataSource.

2008-04-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: Minor cleanups and call CellMouseUp.

	* DataGridViewButtonCell.cs: Implement.

2008-04-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	[Fixes bug #376081]

2008-04-01  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* BindingSource.cs: EndEdit and CancelEdit should call EndCurrentEdit

	support for ICancelAddNew too.

2008-04-01  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* CurrencyManager.cs: When calling EndCurrentEdit/CancelCurrentEdit,

2008-03-30  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* BindingSource.cs: IsBindingSuspended, ResumeBinding and
	SuspendBinding depend on CurrencyManager. Implement RemoveCurrent,
	hookup the remaining events related to CurrencyManager, and fire
	OnListChanged also for the Clear () method.

2008-03-30  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* BindingSource.cs: Use Current and Position implementations in
	CurrencyManager instead of using our own routines, since we need 
	to be in synch with it. Count should NEVER return a -1 value, and 
	also report ListChanged events for both simple IList data 
	sources (manually) as well for IBindingList ones (by hooking up an
	event handler for it).

2008-03-28  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* BindingSource.cs: Make one .ctor call the another, to avoid
	duplicate code. Add the CurrencyManager property, and also for AddNew
	throw the proper exceptions and show better error messages.

	potential NRE that is being reported by Reflector.

2008-03-27  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Create the scrollbars earlier in the constructor
	to attempt to guard against an NRE in SetTop in Reflector.

2008-03-27  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridView.cs, DataGridViewCell.cs, DataGridViewCell.cs,
	DataGridViewRowCollection.cs: Do not scroll column and row headers,
	show messagebox on data format error, use column display index
	correctly, make sure HitTest supports new layout stuff,
	make sure scrollbars support new layout stuff.

2008-03-27  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs : Patch by Doug Rintoul.
	  For some IM engines, keypress events need to delay call
	  to XPending() and XNextEvent() in the loop so that it
	  does not mess the orders in XIM commit callback.
	  Some KeyRelease events such as shift keys need to be
	  processed both in the IM engine and winforms driver
	  itself since winforms holds its own state check.

	  For details, see: http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-winforms-list/2008-March/003279.html

2008-03-27  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* X11Keyboard.cs, XplatUIX11.cs :
	  add primitive support for XIM input support (preedit-
	  nothing and status-nothing). It requires precise event
	  capturing (XSelectInput/"filterEvents") and different
	  call to XFilterEvent against root window.
	  Get composed string and send dummy WM_IME_COMPOSITION.
	  Free XIM and XIC instances in finalizer.

	  (This first patch does not include suggested changes
	   by Doug Rintoul. It will follow.)

	[Fixes bug #325979]

2008-03-25  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridViewRowCollection.cs: Disable row sharing when

	getting DGV usable first before we worry about optimizations.

2008-03-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* BindingSource.cs: When resetting our internal list, compute list
	item type information to be used for indirect list access. Also
	implement/tune some properties and methods related to the list access
	too.
	* ListBindingHelper.cs: Add a stub for GetListName method, used from
	BindingSource.

2008-03-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridViewRow.cs: Draw cells in column DisplayIndex order
	instead of Index order.

2008-03-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

2008-03-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: Turn off and on the "new row" when 
	AllowUserToAddRows is toggled.  When the handle is created,
	set current cell and selected cell/row/col.

2008-03-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: When navigating the drop down by keyboard, we
	need to scroll the list box if our selection moves out of the
	currently shown items.  [Fixes bug #371990]

2008-03-24  Luke Page <luke.a.page@gmail.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: Handles visible rtf tag and no longer shows the text
	on the control. Also now handles unicode compatibility characters and
	stores the unicode compatibility length on the stack. Fixes Bugs
	#355198 and #366436.

2008-03-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* BindingSource..cs: Take into account DataMember when re-creating the
	List property, and also create a specific kind of list as needed.

2008-03-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBindingHelper.cs: Add a new case for GetList () method - when we
	get an empty IEnumerable, try to detect whether the datamember is
	valid or not for that type, if true, return null, and throw exception
	otherwise.

2008-03-22  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Alt-Down should drop down the list, Esc should
	retract it.  [Fixes bug #371989]

	* DataGridViewCell.cs: Fix border painting for column headers.

2008-03-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	PropertyTabs property.

2008-03-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	method overloads.

2008-03-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: When the user types into the textbox, reset
	the selected index to -1.  [Fixes bug #371672]

2008-03-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Support Control-A for selecting everything
	in an OpenFileDialog.  [Fixes bug #371564]

2008-03-15  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: When row/column visible/height properties
	change, invalidate.  Take the NIEX out of InvalidateRow/Column
	etc.  We don't support them yet, but we can just invalidate
	everything until we do support them.  (Added MonoTODO).  Set
	proper control styles.
	* DataGridViewRow.cs: Don't call PaintHeader if row headers
	are turned off.

	grid width isn't as wide as the DGV.

2008-03-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridView*: Completely revamp the drawing to match the
	public API.  Our grids now look better, and call all the
	appropriate methods and event to allow users to override
	the painting and do their own.

2008-03-13  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBindingHelper.cs: Implement 2.0 GetList methods.

	one we are interested.  These calls were failing if there
	were more than one attribute.
	[Fixes bug #370385]

2008-03-13  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs: Hide ctor from 1.1 profile.

	* DataGridView*.cs: corcompare stuffs.

2008-03-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: Remove an incorrect invalidate optimization.
	The savings aren't worth the extra code to fix the optimization.
	[Fixes bug #368585]

2008-03-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolBar.cs: Always call base.Dock in the Dock override so that
	Control's layout_type gets reset correctly.
	[Fixes bug #368882]

2008-03-11  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* X11Dnd.cs: End DnD operation also for the middle mouse button.

2008-03-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs: We can't do MenuStrip implicit mnemonics
	at the same time we do explicit ones, because we have to give all
	other controls on the container a chance to handle explicit ones
	first.  If no one has an explicit mnemonic, then we can let the
	MenuStrip have a shot at implicit mnemonics.
	* MenuStrip.cs: Create an implicit mnemonic function.
	* ToolStrip.cs: When processing explicit mnemonics, don't do implicit
	mnemonics for MenuStrips.
	[Fixes bug #368493]

2008-03-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* AxHost.cs, Binding.cs, DataGridView.cs, DataGridViewCell.cs,
	DataGridColumnStyle.cs: corcompare stuffs.

2008-03-10  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Don't add any ColumnHeader to Columns if view is not
	Details - This is needed after we added the bits to use any available
	column also for List and SmallIcon view. 

2008-03-09  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Fire SelectedIndexChanged and SelectedValueChanged events
	at the proper place, not only when changing SelectedIndex and changing
	the selection using keys/mouse, as .net does.

2008-03-07  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ControlBindingsCollection.cs: Implement last 2.0
	DefaultDataSourceUpdateMode property. Also fix a wrong instruction
	in the new 2.0 Add methods.

2008-03-07  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: When calling SelectedIndexCollection.Clear,
	return if no items are previously selected - this is done to avoid 
	firing OnSelectedIndexChanged without need to do so. Also,
	when creating handle ensure that the focused item is visible (as
	.net does).

2008-03-06  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Rewrote/refactored most of selection code. We require
	the following things in selection: a) keep selection sorted (both
	indices and items), b) SelectedIndices automatically detect the
	selection mode, c) SelectedIndex should be the first selected item
	index, d) Need to Focus/adjust scroll bar when selecting a new item,
	not only for SelectedIndex, which is specially important in Multi*
	selection modes. To achieve this we are moving the selection core to
	SelectedIndexCollection and make depend all selection modifications on
	it.
	Fixes #366438.

2008-03-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

2008-03-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	Control.cs: Don't call ProcessMenuKey on WM_SYSKEYUP if there
	was a mnemonic pressed as well as Alt.  Also, if nothing handles a
	mnemonic, let the ToolStripManager have it even if it doesn't
	have a matching mnemonic.
	[Fixes bug #367499]

	but also if the property type is assigneable from the value's
	type.
	[Fixes bug #366566]

2008-03-03  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: 
	 - Subscribe to the listbox only once and not everytime.
	 - Update the textbox even if SetValue fails.
	 - Close the listbox before calling TrySetValue just in case.
	 [Fixes bug #366569]

2008-03-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Hide ICollection.CopyTo from the 1.1 profile.

2008-03-02  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	with Details view).
	Fixes #364484.

2008-03-01  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: For Tile view, always set bounds for the first
	subitem (which is the main one), and also don't let Width be larger
	than ListView.TileSize.Width. Improve code readibility also.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: When painting the ListViewItem instances
	in Tile view, _always_ use the NoWrap flag.
	Fixes #360798.

2008-02-29  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* HtmlElement.cs: Add event handlers, and connect them.

2008-02-28  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* GridEntry.cs:

	   so that DisplayNameAttribute doesn't get ignored.
	 - Check for ParenthesizeNameAttribute and parenthesize the Label.

	* PropertyGridView.cs: Check if an entry is a password.
	[Fixes bugs #365589, #365586, #365588]

2008-02-28  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	close the dropdown

2008-02-26  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Application.cs: Change the message_filters loop so a filter 
	can be removed while looping.

2008-02-26  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* GridEntry.cs: Optimization in ToggleValue so that it caches
	the current value.

	re-read twice for each StandardValue added to the drop-down menu.
	Patch by Andy Hume <andyhume32@yahoo.co.uk> under the MIT/X11

	[Fixes bug #361709]

2008-02-25  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: Actually implement 2.0 NullValue property. Also

	if formatting_enabled is true (we don't mind otherwise).

2008-02-25  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Don't raise ItemClicked for disabled items.
	[Fixes bug #364486]

2008-02-25  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* GridEntry.cs: Use the PropertyDescriptor.PropertyType instead 
	of GetType on the current value as it uses reflection to 
	determine the type. This fixes the case where the new value is 
	null. 

2008-02-25  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: Limit mousewheel scrolling to not scroll
	past the view.

2008-02-24  Luke Page  <luke.a.page@gmail.com>

	* Line.cs, TextControl.cs: Implement offset x and y so that a
	document doesn't have to begin  at (0,0) on the viewpoint.
	* TextBox.cs, TextBoxBase.cs: RightToLeft switches the scroll
	bars and switches the text alignment (and therefore is now
	implemented for textbox). Fixes #321383.

2008-02-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: Actually implement 2.0 FormatString and FormatInfo
	properties. Also when changing FormattingEnabled update the control

	* Binding.cs: Add stubs for the overloads of the Add method in
	CBCollection.

2008-02-22  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: PullData () returns a false value if we got an exception.
	Also when validating the control and we get an error, instead of
	setting the value of the previous one, cancel the event (tested in 1.1
	and 2.0).

2008-02-22  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

2008-02-21  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Factor in checkboxes = false and state images in
	to HitTest.  [Fixes bug #363360]

	ResizeRedraw control styles.
	[Fixes bug #363555]

2008-02-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs: StateImages are basically custom checkboxes, so
	factor their size the same as real checkboxes when determining
	what got clicked.
	[Fixes bug #363367]

2008-02-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* MessageBox.cs: Make the message box wider if the form caption
	is longer than the text in the form.

	[Fixes bug #361709]

2008-02-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Application.cs: Guard against an NRE in CompanyName and
	ProductName.

2008-02-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

2008-02-20  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* PropertyGridView.cs:

	constructor behavior more accurate.  [Fixes bug #362117]

2008-02-19  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: Added a new flag is_disposing to track if the
	window is currently in the process of being disposed of.
	This is used so that, when firing visibility changes triggered
	by unparenting controls during Dispose, the control doesn't
	get created again.	

2008-02-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Set height to preferred height when the handle
	is created.  [Fixes bug #360862]

2008-02-18  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Create FosterParent with border width at 0.
	With the previous value of 4, everytime a control got reparented
	from parent = null, it's location would be shifted right and 
	down by 4, since these coordinates would be offset by the 
	FosterParent's border width.

2008-02-18  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* Control.cs: During diposing firstly remove ourselfes from
	the parent and *then* destroy our handle, because removing
	ourselfes from the parent controls collection causes 
	VisibilityChange, etc events, which require a handle and end
	up recreating the control.

2008-02-17  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* GridEntry.cs: Set expanded state before notifying that the
	expansion has taken place.

	 - Fix handling of a null current value.
	 - Swallow editor exceptions.
	[Fixes bug #362114]

	* PropertyGrid.cs: Clear current items first thing before 
	repopulating subitems.
	* GridEntry.cs: 
	 - Handle null StandardValuesCollection.
	 - Mark as not editable if there is no PropertyDescriptor and
	 if the Converter cannot convert from string.
	[Part of fix for bugs #360666 and #358332]

2008-02-15  Luke Page  <luke.a.page@gmail.com>
	* MaskedTextBox.cs: Now skips non editable characters after a
	character has been entered and we are progressing to the next
	position in the MaskedTextBox.

2008-02-15  Luke Page  <luke.a.page@gmail.com>
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Handles MouseDown when shift key is clicked so
	that it changes the selection rather than just repositioning the
	cursor. Fixes Bug #360873.

2008-02-15  Luke Page  <luke.a.page@gmail.com>
	* TextBoxBase.cs, TextControl.cs, RichTextBox.cs: TextChanged fires
	when Undo/Redo changes the text. Undo/Redo/Undo/Redo now works
	correctly. See #359330

2008-02-15  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: If the handle is null when posting a message, use the
	current thread queue to post instead. Fixes #332409

	* SendKeys.cs: Slight optimization

2008-02-14  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* PropertyGrid.cs, PropertyGridView.cs:
	Fix multiple scrolling and sizing issues.
	[Fixes bug #359199]

2008-02-12  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: Ensure that drop down editors are shown
	in the WorkingArea of the screen.
	[Fixes bug #359807]

2008-02-12  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* GridEntry.cs: Fail silently when UITypeEditor is missing.
	[Fixes bug #360666]

2008-02-11  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: Implement 2.0 DataSourceNullValue property.

2008-02-11  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* PropertyGridView.cs:
	 - Clear the controls in the drop down form after it is hidden.
	 - Fix Width sizing of the dropdown editors to match MSFT.

2008-02-11  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: 
	 - Fix height for drawing the grid entry
	 text value, so that it clips multiline text properly.
	 - Fix unfocusing to match MSFT.

2008-02-11  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* PropertyGrid.cs: Do not populate subgriditems unless expandable.
	Fixes a bug where on repopulation after value changed items become
	expandable.

2008-02-10  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: For the 2.0 profile, look for a 
	'PropertyChanged' event in the target control, and add checks for
	DataSourceUpdateMode property to change -or not- the data source
	from validation/control property change.

2008-02-10  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Binding.cs : build fix (operator == is not overriden in 1.x. Do
	  not compare struct with null in 2.0).

2008-02-10  Luke Page <luke.a.page@gmail.com>

	* MaskedTextBox.cs: UseSystemPasswordChar updates PasswordChar, PasswordChar
	updates the provider and if not using a provider, uses the internal document
	class implementation of password char. Also when showing text, uses display string
	from the provider, instead of the actual text.

2008-02-09  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: Ooooops, forgot to take into account the data_source
	and binding_member_info null case (it was breaking the Binding tests).

2008-02-09  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: Implement support for data source changes exposed by
	'PropertyNameChanged' events, and update the control property as
	needed.

2008-02-08  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: Implement 2.0 WriteValue method.

2008-02-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	Commit patch from James Purcell for better AutoScale implementation:

	* ScaleControl should call GetScaledBounds with the control's total size rather
	than client size.  GetScaledBounds should handle ignoring the borders in its
	calculations.  Cleaned up ScaleControl/GetScaledBounds overrides in controls
	(for the most part they just call the base code now since that is fixed).
	* Added ScaleChildrenInternal to allow controls to disable scaling of children
	without having to override ScaleChildren (since none of .NET's controls do). 
	This is required for most controls in Mono that have scrollbars to prevent the
	scrollbars from being moved/resized.
	* Nested ContainerControls can have a different scale mode than their parent. 
	This is briefly mentioned in MSDN but is buggy in MS.NET (the runtime and
	designer produce different results both of which look incorrect).
	* Default AutoScaleMode for ContainerControl should be Inherit.
	* Simplified workaround for ComboBox scaling issue.
	* 1.0 style auto-scaling now uses its own methods instead of sharing 2.0's. 
	1.0 style auto scaling should scale the whole control's size instead of
	ignoring the borders (except for Form) and the rounding is done differently to
	preserve control alignment.
	* ApplyAutoScaling (used for 1.0 style) should use the rounded result of
	GetAutoScaleSize.
	* Cleaned up fix for "Bug 355703 - Setting AutoScale = true doesn't stick".
	* CurrentAutoScaleDimensions should round the estimated character width instead
	of truncating.
	* ListBox's GetScaledBounds should always use the height it was set to instead
	of the height that was passed in.  This prevents rounding errors from
	accumulating quickly with IntegralHeight.
	[Bug #359098]

2008-02-08  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: Add a null check (darn it). 

2008-02-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Make sure the requesting form actually owns the
	control menu items before removing them.  Also, use
	Suspend/ResumeLayout when adding or removing items so we only
	layout once.
	[Fixes bug #359887]

2008-02-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Guard against an NRE in ShowFocusCues.
	[Fixes bug #359830]

2008-02-08  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: Implement 2.0 ReadValue method and ControlUpdateMode
	property, as well as stubbing DataSourceUpdateMode.

2008-02-08  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: When closing forms, get focus back to the active control of the
	active form. [Fixes #341314, corner case]
	
2008-02-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: After we move the scrollbars, invalidate the NC
	area, so any old scrollbar artifacts are cleaned up.
	[Fixes bug #336305]

2008-02-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* MdiWindowManager.cs: If we are maximized and using MainMenuStrip
	for our menus, display that control box menu instead of the 1.1
	menu one.

2008-02-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* MdiControlStrip.cs: Add property to access the mdi form tied to
	each toolstripitem.
	* MdiClient.cs: Be smarter about removing and adding toolstripitems
	to the implicitly merged menu.  Every time we clicked the form, items
	were getting removed and the re-added, causing the form to jump around
	as the menu resized.

2008-02-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Make sure the NormalBounds always gets set.  It
	was being reset by the implicit menu merge for menustrips.
	[Fixes bug #336296]

2008-02-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Don't do the previous change when WindowState = Normal,
	or it messes up where the window is placed.  Fixes test failure.

2008-02-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: When becoming visible, if we are an MDI child, call
	SetWindowState with a dummy old_state so that changes will actually
	be made.
	[Fixes the 2nd part of bug #325473]

2008-02-07  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Reset properties to their pre parent-change values in case
	the new parent == null (in which case we're basically removing the control, 
	and don't want any events fired due to fake property changes)
	[Fixes #355850]

2008-02-06  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: 
	 - Refactor SetValue to allow setting the value
	when a custom editor is used, but the entry is not editable.
	 - Remove the custom editor control on CloseDropDown.
	[Fixes #359196]

2008-02-06  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* PrintControllerWithStatusDialog.cs: Set PrintFileName value through

	* WebBrowser.cs: Do a normal page refresh by default.

2008-02-05  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs, XplatUICarbon.cs: set the hwnd.Mapped flag when we create 
	the window so that the check on Control.UpdateZOrderOfChild passes on non-X
	platforms. Fixes #359036
	
	Note: Control.UpdateZOrderOfChild needs to be rewritten to not rely on 
	platform-specific flags.

2008-02-05  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Binding.cs: Add 2.0 BindableComponent property - just return control
	by now.

2008-02-05  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	Jonathan for this patch. Fixes #358442.

2008-02-05  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: If we change the active MDI child form, let the others
	know they need to repaint their title bar so it will appear inactive.
	[Fixes part 1 of bug #325473]

2008-02-05  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	 * PropertyGridView.cs: Do not trucate custom editors' width

	System.Drawing.  Removing this translation from here.

2008-02-04  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	 * PropertyGrid.cs, PropertyGridView.cs, GridEntry.cs,
	 CategoryGridEntry.cs, RootGridEntry.cs, GridItem.cs,

	 PropertyGrid rewrite part 2. Tons of bugfixes and new features.

2008-02-04  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* X11Keyboard.cs: VK_MENU should send a KEYUP instead of 
	SYSKEYUP if any other key has been pressed in the mean time.
	Fixes #324404

2008-02-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: In ItemControl.ItemsMouseMove, only fire ItemDrag event
	when the item in current position is different than 0. Also, save the
	item index in the beginning of the operation, instead of getting the
	index of the item when the event is actually performed. Lastly clean
	the related fields in ItemsMouseUp if the ItemDrag operation wasn't
	triggered.
	[Fixes #357873]

2008-02-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Alt-Minus for MDI children system menu should work
	with both the minus keys on the keyboard.
	[Fixes bug #336295]

2008-02-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Don't invalidate on region change.  The WM should
	take care of this automagically.  Keeps us out of an infinite
	paint loop if someone changes the Region in the OnPaint.
	[Fixes bug #358327]

2008-02-04  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

2008-02-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Hwnd.cs: Ensure that windows moved into -'ve coordinate space
	get that region removed from the paint event.
	* XplatUICarbon.cs: Remove the window mapping after disposing of 
	window.  Prevents a crash with handle reuse.  Optimize exposes
	only onto visible windows (rare; but possible).

2008-02-01  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* UpDownBase.cs: Make sure the internal textbox calls the base's
	OnMouseDown and OnMouseUp so the textbox will function correctly.
	There were notes saying it doesn't chain up, but its an internal

	* Form.cs: Remove all active_tracker (used by menu) stuff, it is now moved 
	to Control class, it makes possible to grab menu to controls that can't

	WmMouseMove removed since it was used only to track menu events.

	* Control.cs:
	- Moved all active_tracker stuff from Form.
	- ProcessActiveTracker added to prevent code duplicity, now mouse events

	[Fixes bug #333668]

2008-01-17  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	always draw at least one line, but it is a lie.
	[Fixes bug #324941]

2008-01-17  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	so we don't fire click events.

	* Control.cs: 
	- (HandleClick) Check if validation was cancelled before  firing the click
	events (doubleclicks are fired, but not clicks)
	- (WmLButtonDown) Reset validation flag. The flag is normally reset on 
	ContainerControl.set_ActiveControl, but in the case of non-selectable

	* ListControl.cs: SelectedValue should return a null value if
	SelectedIndex is -1. Also, when setting it, it should throw an
	ArgumentNullException if the value is null, as well as taking
	into account the String.Empty value, instead of ignoring it (we have
	tests for that now).
	Fixes part of #324286.

2008-01-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs, TextControl.cs: Patch from Luke Page to ensure
	SelectionStart is updated after pressing enter.  Fixes bug #351918.

2008-01-05  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Revert a piece r92316 that prevented the fix
	from working when there were multiple tags in the text box.
	Fixes bug #351881.

2008-01-05  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Apply patch from Luke Page that prevents an
	NRE when determining the beginning of a paragraph.
	Fixes bug #351886.

2008-01-05  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Apply patch from Luke Page that ensures the
	caret gets moved with clicking away from a selected block of
	text.  Fixes bug #351885.

2008-01-05  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Apply patch from Luke Page that takes line
	alignment into account for mouse selection, so that center and
	right aligned text can be selected.
	Fixes bug #351881.

2008-01-05  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: Apply patch from Luke Page that fixes some caret
	issues after loading an RTF file by using the correct line feeds.
	Fixes bug #351841.

2008-01-05  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextControl.cs: When deleting multiple line selections, we need
	to invalidate every line beginning at the first line of the selection.
	Patch from Luke Page fixes bug #351791.

2008-01-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListControl.cs: When getting a CurrencyManager.PositionChanged
	event, don't set SelectedIndex if the number of items is 1. This is
	because, for the first item, PositionChanged is fired _before_
	ItemChanged (the place where we actually populate the items), and
	leave us in a temporary invalid state (since items collection is
	empty).
	Fixes #349655.

2008-01-04  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* XplatUICarbon.cs:  Create native toolwindows instead of
	the managed drawing ones.

2008-01-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* LineTag.cs: If the line doesn't have any characters, return
	0 for GetCharIndex.  Fixes an AOORE exception after certain
	caret movements.  Fixes bug #351683.  Patch by Luke Page.

2008-01-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Apply patch from Luke Page so when backspace
	is hit when there is selected text, only the selected text gets
	deleted, not the character in front of the selection as well.
	Fixes bug #351578.

2008-01-03  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: When the values are displayed, calculate the
	ComboListBox scrollbar's LargeChange based on the visible area's
	height and  the actuall ItemHeight, instead of calculating it
	based on MaxDropItems value, since it's not used by our _current_ 
	2.0 profile.
	Fixes #332366.

2008-01-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Line.cs, LineTag.cs, RichTextBox.cs, TextBoxBase.cs, TextControl.cs:
	Patch from Luke Page that fixes issues with font colors and styles
	not showing up in a readonly RichTextBox.  Fixes bug #324354.

2008-01-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Line.cs, RichTextBox.cs, TextControl.cs: Another awesome patch
	from Luke Page.  This one fixes bug #349926.

2007-12-30  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* CurrencyManager.cs: Actually fire the 2.0 ListChanged event when
	an item in the IBindingList source changes with
	ListChangedType.ItemAdded. Ignore for now firing the event for other
	changes, since we want to have tests for those cases as well.

2007-12-28  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Don't store a 1x1 Bitmap for every TextBox
	created.

2007-12-28  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxTextRenderer.cs: Implement a cache for measuring each
	character.  This is effective because the typical usage of a
	TextBox is with a limited amount of fonts and characters, and
	the current implementation of TextBox measures everything one
	character at a time.  Another second or two speedup for bug #347238.

2007-12-28  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Rewrite the Font getter to only query the parent's
	Font property once instead of twice.  Since this operation is
	recursive, the queries were growing exponentially as the control
	tree got deeper.  Another second or two speedup for bug #347238.

2007-12-28  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Avoid setting a parent (and more importantly, updating
	the zorder of all its children) if the parent is already correct in
	WmShowWindow.  Decreases the startup time of the test case on bug
	#347238 from 35 seconds to 11 seconds.

2007-12-27  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: When the dnd operation has started and we are 
	in the dnd loop, don't dispatch either WM_LBUTTONUP nor WM_RBUTTONUP.
	This is done to match .Net, which doesn't send those messages after
	dnd operation was completed/cancelled.
	Fixes #349922.

2007-12-27  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Previous change should be != null, not == null.
	Thanks Gert!

2007-12-27  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Guard against an NRE after ItemClicked is called, the
	user may have moved the mouse off the current item during the event.

2007-12-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: In ItemControl.ItemsMouseMove, try to avoid
	calling GetItemAt for every MouseMove event by also taking into
	account whether any mouse button is pressed (probably dragging); 
	if so, we can call GetItemAt, and if not, try to not call it 
	(GetItemAt can be quite expensive when used with a large number of items).

2007-12-22  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Implement -finally- support for dnd, by calling
	OnItemDrag as needed. Also, remove the dnd TODO, and add myself to the
	authors list ;-).
	* ListViewInsertionMark.cs: Implement NearestIndex method, by doing a
	simple calculation of distances for all the items in the owner
	listview.

2007-12-21  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* XplatUICarbon.cs:  Ensure that we create WindowMapping handles
	for windows that are originally created as invisible.  Fixes missing
	main window in paint-mono.

2007-12-21  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* XplatUICarbon.cs:  Register our D&D handler.  Register our custom
	subclass handler for com.novell.mwfview subclassing HIView.  Implement
	Pasteboard and Dnd methods.

2007-12-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: When we got focus, give focus to first item if there
	wasn't any pervious focused item. Also update navigation to depend on
	SelectedIndex rather than FocusedItem, just as .Net does.
	Fixes #349174.

2007-12-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Both FindString and FindStringExact methods must do an
	case insensitive search, should allow the last valid index to be
	passed in the overload taking an initial index, and should also
	continue searching from the top back to the specified index when it
	reaches the bottom.

2007-12-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Apply patch from Luke Page that fixes a scrolling
	redraw issue, and allows RichTextBox to draw colored text even while
	disabled or readonly.

2007-12-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs, TextBoxBase.cs: Apply patch from Luke Page that
	disallows cut/paste in a readonly textbox, adds support for Shift-Insert,
	and doesn't grey text in a disabled RichTextBox.

2007-12-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: Apply patch from Luke Page that adds better support
	for many RTF commands: quad alignment, separate formatting for blocks
	inside groups, and ParDef support.  Makes the test case from bug #324589
	look much better.

2007-12-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* LineTag.cs: Fix an error in the new Draw method that caused
	a crash when rendering the document on bug #324589.

2007-12-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Line.cs, LineTag.cs, RichTextBox.cs, TextBoxBase.cs,
	TextControl.cs: Apply patch from Luke Page that adds support
	for URL links in RichTextBox.
	[Fixes enhancement #342516]

2007-12-18  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MenuItem.cs: When cloning menuitem clone also name and tag properties for
	2.0 profile. Thanks Ernesto Carrea and Luke Page. Fixes bug #340289.

2007-12-18  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: When a key gets pressed, try to find a string
	if the key is a character or a digit.
	Fixes #343971.

2007-12-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TableLayoutPanel.cs: Remove some unused variables.

2007-12-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DateTimePicker.cs: Commit patch from Luke Page that ensures
	we don't end up at an invalid date when we click the up/down
	spinner to change the month or year.  Fixes bug #348682.

2007-12-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Application.cs: Calling Exit in 2.0 should chain to the
	Exit (CancelEventArgs) version so it can be cancelled.
	* Form.cs: Create a flag to allow raising the Closing
	events to be skipped.  We raise them once in Application.Exit
	and don't want to raise them again when the Form is actually
	closed.  [Fixes bug #349073]

2007-12-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripDropDown.cs: Guard against an NRE when there
	hasn't been a mainform set in the application context.
	[Fixes bug #349108]

2007-12-15  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: When SetBoundsCore gets called, besides
	calling UpdateScrollBars, update the value of
	last_visible_index, since we could need to show more items
	than before, and we need to let the paint routines know that.
	Fixes #344445.

2007-12-14  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Add DesignerSerializationVisibility attribute to
	InsertionMark property.
	* ListViewItem.cs: Add same attribute to Position property.

2007-12-14  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: .ctor (SerializationInfo, StreamingContext)
	is 2.0 only.

2007-12-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Don't draw the background on a
	flat button if there is a background image.
	[Fixes bug #348649]

2007-12-13  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: If we remove the item currently selected,
	remove it not only from SelectedItems, but also
	resetting selected_index. Moreover, set focused_item to Items.Count - 1 if 
	the items count decreased and focused_item has bigger value than that.

2007-12-13  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Perform our layout after we resize ourselves
	if we had to adjust our AutoSize.  Missed commit for bug
	#346246.

2007-12-13  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TableLayoutPanel.cs: Override GetPreferredSizeCore so
	we can provide an implementation of AutoSize.
	[Fixes bug #346246]

2007-12-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Add the internal overload Sort (bool paint),
	to indicate whether we actually need a paint or we will
	call Refresh ourselves. This way we don't request a paint
	_before_ having an updated and valid layout.
	Fixes #347233.

2007-12-12  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* XPlatUIX11.cs: Send paint messages when updating a systray icon
	* NotifyIcon.cs: Invalidate the window before doing a systray change so it is
	properly invalidated. 
	Fixes #324237

2007-12-10  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: When using a .ctor taking a ListViewGroup,
	don't simply assign it to our internal group field, but instead 
	use our Group property, which should do all the neccessary work
	required to support groups. Fixes an issue reported to me (mail) by a 
	guy using this new feature.

2007-12-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Use Scale instead of ScaleControl to ensure the
	whole hierarchy gets scaled.
	[Fixes bug #347282]

2007-12-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DateTimePicker.cs: Don't set the internal MonthCalendar's
	Parent property.  Doing this causes the control to be hosted by
	the Form instead of being a popup window.
	[Fixes bug #347665]

2007-12-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripItemCollection.cs: If we try to insert a ToolStripItem
	at an index higher than Count, just use Add instead of Insert.
	[Fixes bug #347669]

2007-12-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Don't draw a PictureBox's background in

	trying to zorder. Fixes #342509, #346955

	* ListView.cs:
	* ListViewInsertionMark.cs:

	new 2.0 ListView.InsertionMark property.

2007-12-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* CurrencyManager.cs: Silence some debug spew.

2007-12-07  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>
	
	* Hwnd.cs: Refactor GetClippingRectangles to suppose returning the
	masks for our children as well as siblings to avoid having to query
	Quartz for this information.
	* XplatUICarbon.cs: Implement a delegate based system to pass
	information to System.Drawing.  Implement Async methods.  Remove
	the hack for the resize thumb and imlpement a transparent Grow Box.
	Rework the messaging system to proplery create window's and messages,
	fixes TabControl.

2007-12-06  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* X11Keyboard.cs: Use Xutf8LookupString to support international 
	characters under alternate codepages. Patch from #340878

2007-12-06  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When doing layout computations, set position in the
	ListView instances (we cache the position just as .Net does).
	* ListViewItem.cs: New internal setter method for Position. Also set
	position field as also available in 1.1, since we are going to use it
	now in the common case.

2007-12-06  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: When removing controls, get the actual container
	to notify about active control changes. Fixes 341314.

2007-12-06  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: Forgot to add Font to our serialization stuff.

2007-12-05  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	mapped. Fixes #342509

2007-12-05  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: Actually implement serialization on this class.

2007-12-05  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	LinkCollection. Spaces to tabs, and removed extra tabs.

2007-12-04  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Make toolwindows' decorations show up without causing any
	  tests to fail (hopefully).

2007-12-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripDropDownMenu.cs: Fill in AffectedBounds when drawing
	the image margin so custom renderers can correctly place it.

2007-12-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* StatusStrip.cs: Fill in AffectedBounds when drawing the grip
	so custom renderers can correctly place it.

2007-12-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Application.cs: Let WM_CHAR messages flow through to controls
	hosted in Strips.  [Fixes bug #343972]

2007-12-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripManager.cs: Guard against an NRE I ran into.

2007-12-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* LinkLabel.cs: Apply patch from George to fix bug 344012.  If
	a Link is manually added to the Links collection, we need to set
	its owner, so it can invalidate properly.
	[Fixes bug #344012]

2007-11-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When changing ListViewItem.Position (which calls
	ListView.ChangeItemLocation), invalidate not only the area
	corresponding to the main item, but also to the area occupied
	by the items being moved.

2007-11-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When changing the position of a given item,
	don't use item bounds, but item areas (which includes the item spacing
	between them). Also, use first/last position if the requested
	position is outside bounds (as .Net does). Invalidate the previous and
	new bounds. Finally, in ItemControl.ItemsMouseDown use the actual item
	in a specific position, instead of directly accessing Items collection
	(this is done to get the right item - remember an Item can have a
	different position in the grid than in the Items collection).

2007-11-23  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MessageBox.cs: Calculate text area instead of just top left, this rect 
	area will be used in DrawString. Fixes bug #343364.

2007-11-23  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MessageBox.cs: Calculate max amount for text area width, it must be 60% of
	screen width. Partially fixes bug #343364.

2007-11-23  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* NotifyIcon.cs: Remove duplicated code before call realculate and put this
	code inside recalculate, it makes code more simple.

2007-11-22  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* NotifyIcon.cs: When recalculate icon verify if icon is active to decide
	between update or add icon. Fixes bug #324344.

2007-11-21  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* XPlatUIX11.cs: Do not treat tool windows as if they have no 
	window manager, since that stretches the drawing area to include
	the window decorations, and they get hidden. Reverts r84444 and fixes
	#335849 and #342790 (mdi and pdn3 regression)

2007-11-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When setting focused item, try to give focus to the
	previous one _only_ if the previous one remains valid. 
	Fixes #342504.

2007-11-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Application.cs: Revert r89650, as it broke a common case to fix
	an obscure case.  Fixes bug #342606.

	[Fixes bug #342123]

2007-11-19  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: Check for empty Text before assign to cp.Caption in CreateParams
	it prevent problems when empty captions. [Fixes #342141]

2007-11-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Label.cs: Use Size instead of None.  Fixes bug #342077.

	* ListViewItem.cs: Implement 2.0 FindNearestItem method.

	but there isn't a MdiContainer.
	[Fixes bug #342358]

2007-11-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Don't recalculate document if the recalc_start and
	recalc_end hasn't changed.

2007-11-17  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* DataGridViewTextBoxCell.cs: Removed CWL.

2007-11-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	recalculation when the font changes.

2007-11-16  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: When updating the zorder, check if the child to update is
	the same control that is set to always be on top (i.e., scrollbars), and 
	just put it on top directly. Fixes BadMatch error on pdn3

2007-11-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Throw the needed exceptions for FindNearestItem.

2007-11-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Don't perform a new layout when a label changes its text,
	cause label handles its own autosizing.
	[Fixes bug #342077]

2007-11-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Implement 2.0 FindNearestItem methods.

2007-11-15  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripPanel.cs: Make Join at least add the control to the panel,
	even if the rest of what Join does isn't supported.  Add some more
	support for vertical toolbars.
	* ToolStripPanelRow.cs: Add some more support for vertical toolbars.
	[Fixes the application breaking parts of bug #341998]

2007-11-15  Jonathan Pobst <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: When determining if we have a check/image margin,
	we need to look at ShowCheckMargin as well as ShowImageMargin.

2007-11-15  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* XplatUIOSX.cs: Rename to...
	* XplatUICarbon.cs: and refactor all event handling out to the new event handling
	system in System.Windows.Forms.CarbonInternal.  Lots of code cleanup as well.

2007-11-15  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* KeysConverter.cs: The default values should be an array of Keys, not
	strings.  Also, the array has more values for 2.0.
	[Fixes bug #341851]

2007-11-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Application.cs: Change ExecutablePath to use 
	Process.GetCurrentProcess ().MainModule.FileName instead of Assembly.GetEntryAssembly.
	[Fixes bug #323552]

2007-11-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* LineTag.cs: Don't attempt to draw '\r', treat it like it doesn't exist.
	When measureing CR or LF, use /u000D instead of /u0013. (Hex, not decimal.)
	* TextControl.cs: Fix a case in GetLineEnding where a \n before a \r would
	be ignored.  Create a new GetLineEnding that can specify which types of
	line endings to look for.  On Insert, only create new lines for \n and \r\n.
	[Fixes bug #324274]

2007-11-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: As we loop through each line changing the font, tell
	the document that the line needs to be recalculated.  Fixes bug #341534.

2007-11-13  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>
	[Another round of refactoring]
	* Line.cs: Add DeleteCharacters.
	* LineTag.cs: Add Delete.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Update to use new methods.
	* TextControl.cs: Refactor the Delete* methods.

2007-11-13  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: Add an initial implementation of
	2.0 ListViewItem.Position getter.

2007-11-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Add a reordered_items_indices array, to allow us
	to have a different sorting than that of Items (the sorting in Items
	could not match the actual sorting in screen). This is needed to
	implement a pair of 2.0 features.
	* ListViewItem.cs: Add a DisplayIndex property to keep track of the
	actual position in the ListView grid, since it could have a position
	different than its Index (position in ListViewItemCollection). 

2007-11-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Label.cs: Add StringFormatFlags.LineLimit.  This tells DrawString to
	not draw partial lines.
	* LinkLabel.cs: Change FormatFlags setter from = to |= so that the
	LineLimit flag from the base is preserved.
	Fixes the windows part of bug #338965.

2007-11-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Move handling of the enter key from KEYDOWN to CHAR
	so that it can be canceled in KeyPress.
	Fixes bug #340078.

2007-11-08  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: In ItemControl, reset mouse-handling related
	fields even if we dont' have items (we still should reset them when
	we had items but then called Items.Clear). Partially based in a patch
	by George Giolfan.
	Fixes #338399.

2007-11-08  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Application.cs: In ProductVersion first try AssemblyFileVersion
	before falling back to assembly version. Fixes bug #339787.

2007-11-08  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	Make sure browser document is ready before retrieving it.
	Clean up cached objects (document) when moving to a new page through
	any of the navigation methods.
	Use the new Mono.WebBrowser.INavigation interface to control navigation.
	Implement OnNavigated event.

2007-11-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Don't draw the background in DrawLabel or
	DrawLinkLabel, this is handled by OnPaintBackground.
	Fixes bug #339565, part II.

2007-11-07  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Revert r88915. Selecting text on a textbox depends on
	getting a Select call on click, so this call needs to be here for now.
	Unfixes #325809

2007-11-07  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* OSXStructs.cs: Add the kEventClassApplication constants.
	* XplatUIOSX.cs: Send a WM_LBUTTONDOWN to the Grab window when the 
	application is deactivated otherwise Menu overlays linger on top of
	other application windows.

2007-11-07  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* XplatUIOSX.cs: Dont throw an exception on OverrideCursor as we
	dont support cursors yet anyways.  This allows Reflector to run.

2007-11-07  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* XplatUIOSX.cs: Implement DragSize.

2007-11-07  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When we receive a WM_LBUTTONDOWN message in
	ItemControl, request the focus, as .Net does. This is needed after 
	Control does not request focus anymore when it receives a
	WM_LBUTTONDOWN.

2007-11-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@Jpobst.com>

	* Label.cs: Make DrawImage internal so it can be called from Theme code.
	Remove the DrawImage call from OnPaint.
	* LinkLabel.cs: Remove the DrawImage call from OnPaint.

2007-11-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Add 2.0 BackgroundImageTiled property.
	Also, to make it work properly, change item's BackColor and
	BackgroundImageLayout as needed.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Don't fill any background rectangle 
	in ListView.ItemControl when drawing items; just let the Control
	base implementation fill it.

2007-11-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewGroup.cs: Adda TypeConverter attribute for this class,
	as well as adding a custom 'dummy' Converter, as .net does.

2007-11-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: When clicking drop-down button,
	select an index in the listbox only if our standard values collection 
	has one or more items.

2007-11-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: Add a DefaultValue attribute to 2.0 IndentCount
	property.

2007-11-04  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* PropertyGrid.cs: In PropertySort, update the toolbar buttons even if
	the value is not changed. This ensure a pushed button remains in that
	state when clicked again. When switching the value of PropertySort
	between Categorized and CategorizedAlphabetical, do not update the
	grid items and do not fire a PropertyChangedEvent. When clicking the
	sorting buttons, do not modify the PropertySort value when switching
	between Categorized and CategorizedAlphabetical but only update the
	button state.

2007-11-04  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Label.cs: Make AutoEllipsis internal on 1.0 profile. Code
	formatting.

	PropertySort is CategorizedAlphabetical. Set AutoEllipsis to true
	for help description label.

2007-11-03  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When calculating the biggest item for a given column,
	take into account 2.0 LIstViewItem.IndentCount, since it directly affects
	the item's width.

2007-11-03  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* PropertyGrid.cs: Fixed default value for PropertySort. Allow invalid
	value for PropertySort on 1.0 profile. PropertySortChanged event
	should only be fired on 2.0 profile. Fixed NullReferenceException
	in UpdateSortLayout when PropertyGrid contains no items.

2007-11-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* MessageBox.cs: Patch from George to implement MessageBoxDefaultButton.
	[Fixes bug #338554]

2007-11-01  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: Implement 2.0 IndentCount property.

2007-11-01  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: When sending status in a dnd operation, compare current
	effect with the 'allowed' field instead of 'drag_data.Allowed', since
	the later is only created when a Winforms application is both the
	source and the target, but not when we are the target only.
	Fixes part of #324251.

2007-11-01  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* XplatUI*.cs: Add GetPreviousWindow utility method to return windows in
	order of Z-Order.

	children out of the drawing view on mac.

	to handle the orphan and invisible case (1/2 fixes TabStrip drawing in FormsTest)
	
2007-11-01  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Don't process MouseUp for a ToolStripControlHost, clicking
	on the non-hosted-control part of it shouldn't do anything.
	Fixes part of bug #327498.

2007-11-01  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* WebBrowserBase.cs: revert previous change, resize can be called anytime

2007-11-01  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Application.cs: When a toolstrip has the keyboard input loop, let messages
	it does not use flow through to controls that are hosted in menus.
	Same with mouse clicks.
	* Form.cs: Don't close all menus on click if the click is on a
	control hosted in a menu.
	Fixes part of bug #327498, and part of bug #325969.

2007-10-31  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs: Check if the active control is a
	child of a removed control and update active_control accordingly.
	Fixes #329718

2007-10-29  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DateTimePicker.cs: Throw ArgEx if the Value is set outside the MinDate
	or the MaxDate.  Fixed bug #337693.

2007-10-29  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Always call SetWindowPos with SWP_FRAMECHANGED flag
	after calling SetWindowLong for a form, to force an immediate NC refresh.
	Fixes first part of bug #325150.

2007-10-29  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Don't try to resize the listbox when we are DropDownStyle
	simple.  Fixes the last part of bug #322668.

2007-10-29  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* MessageBox.cs: If the owner is TopMost, then the MessageBox form
	needs to be TopMost as well, or else the MessageBox is under the form.
	Patch by George fixes bug #325300.

2007-10-27  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: When starting a new drag operation, reset the static
	'dropped' field to false (previously the implementation didn't reset
	it and got confused after the first drag).
	Fixes #325071.

2007-10-27  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* PropertyGrid.cs: When PropertySort changes, re-organize the grid
	items instead of re-creating them all. For this purpose we now cache
	both CategoryGridEntry items and the GridEntries for the main object's
	properties.
	* GridItem.cs: Make SetParent method abstract.
	* GridEntry.cs: Override the SetParent method (already there, but now
	we override it).
	Fixes #324866.

2007-10-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: Set the plus/minus bounds of a grid item
	depending on its depth (as .Net does). Update the needed values in
	MouseDown handler. Also draw the plus/minus rect after the label,
	so we don't draw on top of it.

2007-10-24  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Return true as default in ProcessKeys to prevent keys to be
	processed by forms or controls when menu is active. [Fixes #333548]

2007-10-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: Don't focus a ToolStripControlHost on Select of the
	parent doesn't have focus.  This was causing ToolStripTextBoxes to take
	focus on mouse over.

2007-10-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Code cleaning, simplifying.

2007-10-24  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* XplatUIStructs.cs: Fix the ToString method of POINT and MSG.

2007-10-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: If the user sets maxlength to 0, it should mean
	the cap is maxvalue, not actually 0.  [Fixes bug #336218]

2007-10-24  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* SendKeys.cs: apply jpobst's patch to bug #332409

2007-10-23  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* TextBoxTextRenderer.cs: Lower bounds max size to Int16.MaxValue, the 
	Windows 2000 gdi DrawText call doesn't draw if it's higher than that
	for some reason

2007-10-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: If a property has an UIEditor available,
	make the drop-down/editor button available only if the property
	is _not_ read only.

2007-10-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: Don't make the grid item textbox 
	editable when a drop-down control is available, but 
	CanConvertFrom (typeof (string)) is false or GetStandardValuesExclusive () is
	true. The same bur the color of the grid item value's label.

2007-10-22  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* OSXStructs.cs: Add the needed constants for keyboard modifiers.
	* OSXKeyboard.cs: Initial support for keyboard and limited modifiers.
	* XplatUIOSX.cs: New reversible frame support.  Wire in the new keyboard
	driver.  Padd the bottom of all real windows so the resize thumb doesn't
	obscure scroll/status bars.

2007-10-22  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* WindowsFormsSection.cs: Implement.

2007-10-22  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Maximize new active mdi child when a maximized child is 
	closed see #325434 patch.

2007-10-22  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Fix remaining issues from layout vertical and horizontal,
	see #325434 patch.

2007-10-21  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: When showing the textbox for a grid item,
	have two local variables to store the read-only and non-editable
	status of a grid item (we were previously using just one variable
	to do this, when actually they are slightly different).
	Fixes part of #325023.

2007-10-21  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: When showing a drop-down list, try to get the
	values using TypeConverter.ConvertTo (to convert to a string). Fixes
	part of #325023.

2007-10-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* PropertyGrid.cs: When updating a property and populating sub grid
	items, remove the previous ones, and invalidate the specific area.
	* PropertyGridView.cs: A new InvalidateBelowGridItem to invalidate the
	area behind a grid item.
	* GridItemCollection.cs: Add an internal Clear method, to allow us to
	clean the items if needed (specially for controls implementing 
	ICustomTypeDescriptor and returning a variable number of properties).
	Fixes #324865.

2007-10-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ListView: Couple of corcompare fixes.

2007-10-17  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	when modifying a property, and if found then invalidate as
	requested.
	Fixes part of #324865.

2007-10-17  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* XplatUIOSX.cs: Re-enable the native driver on the Mac.  This is still
	highly experimental.  Fixed coordinate translation.  Fixed window locations.
	Initial support for clipping. Implemented NC areas and menus.  Support for
	launching from command line from Will Johansson (wjohansson@atacomm.com).
	* OSXStructs.cs: Add ProcessSerialNumer (Patch from Will Johansson

	a custom control that implements IButtonControl instead of an actual
	button.  [Fixes bug #334244]

2007-10-15  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: Change SelectActiveControl to internal, we need to call it in
	MdiWindowManager.
	
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: In RaiseActivated call SelectActiveControl to select
	active control when activate a new mdi window.
	
	[Fixes bug #330495]

2007-10-15  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Dont implicit add listbox_ctrl on OnHandleCreated because it
	is already added.
	[Fixes bug #333617]

2007-10-15  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextControl.cs: When SuspendRecalc is first called, reset the recalc_start
	to MaxValue and recalc_end to MinValue.  Currently, recalc_start is always 1,
	so we always recalculate the whole document instead of just the new part.
	[Fixes bug #325082]

2007-10-15  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* LineTag.cs: Fix a case where the GetCharIndex would not return 0
	when the mouse was to the left of the first character in the line.

2007-10-15  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBox.cs, TextBoxBase.cs: When setting the document's password
	character, use the property instead of the variable so that the
	UseSystemPasswordChar property is taken into account.
	[Fixes bug #333748]

2007-10-13  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs: When a node is right clicked and the "New
	folder" contex menu appears, actually add the new folder to it, even
	if the node is not currently selected. Still use SelectedNode in case 
	there wasn't found a node under the pointer.
	Fixes #325452.

2007-10-13  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: When retrieving the focused state, the index check
	should be done only when ListView is in virtualmode, as it is an
	expensive check for normal mode.

2007-10-13  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: Make the focus state information be stored
	in the ListView, not in the items. This is done to match the MS
	behaviour for items that are not yet part of a ListView control;
	besides that, since just one item can be focused at the same time,
	we save a little space in our items.
	Fixes part of #331643.

2007-10-13  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ComboBox.cs: When focus is lost, deselect the text. When setting
	text of control, select all text. Do not hide selection when control
	does not have focus. Fixes bug #333663.

2007-10-13  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: On 2.0 profile, throw ArgumentOutOFRangeException

	value. Added same check to SelectionStart. Code formatting.

2007-10-13  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Invalidate selection before changing SelectionLength
	or SelectionStart. Code formatting.

2007-10-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: drag_begin_x and drag_begin_y are now set to -1,
	indicating that there was not a previous drag-and-drop operation going
	on.
	Fixes part of #325071.

2007-10-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: When DragEventArgs.Effect is set to a value not part of
	AllowedEffect, don't let the drop operation happen. 
	Fixes #32580.

2007-10-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextRenderer.cs: Use GDI on Windows in both the 1.1 and 2.0 profiles.

2007-10-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Line.cs, LineTag.cs: Guard against an exception when Document.Clear
	is called.

2007-10-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Line.cs: Add a method that finds the tag that contains an x-coord.
	* LineTag.cs: Add a method that finds the character at an x-coord using
	a binary search, the old way was a linear search.
	* TextControl.cs: Change FindCursor to use the above new methods.

2007-10-11  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DragEventArgs.cs: Allow Effect to have a non allowed value (a
	value different than AllowedEffect). This should be possible to
	indicate that dragging is not possible in some control/area.

2007-10-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* LineTag.cs: Encapsulate all variables with properties.  Calculate ascent/
	descent internally when font changes instead of outside code being responsible
	for setting it.
	* Line.cs, RichTextBox.cs, TextBoxBase.cs, TextControl.cs: Use Tag properties
	instead of accessing internal variables.

2007-10-09  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Always call ArrangeIconicWindows before any arrangement and
	remove special treatment for ArrangeIcons since it is already arranged.

2007-10-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxTextRenderer.cs: Draw takes a Color now instead of a Brush, as
	the Win32 backend uses Color.
	* Line.cs, LineTag.cs, RichTextBox.cs, TextBoxBase.cs, TextControl.cs:
	Refactor to store a Color instead of a Brush for Color.

2007-10-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Line.cs, LineTag.cs: Override GetHashCode to make a compiler warning go
	away.  I didn't realize I needed this when I refactored these earlier.

2007-10-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* LineTag.cs, RichTextBox.cs, TextBoxBase.cs, TextControl.cs: Refactor to
	store a Color structure and use the ResPool for back color instead of
	holding onto brushes.

2007-10-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Fix how we calculate the end of the tag we are drawing.
	[Fixes bug #325592]

2007-10-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: When ShowWeekNumbers is changed, force the calendar
	to recalculate its size.  Fixes a part of bug #331052.

2007-10-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* NotifyIcon.cs: Set the correct mouse button when handling right mouse
	button.  Fixes a part of bug #331052.

2007-10-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Trim NewLine before setting XPlatUI.SetText, and when setting
	the CreateParams.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Trim NewLine before drawing MDI children window
	decorations.
	[Fixes bug #330986]

2007-10-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxTextRenderer.cs: Don't make this a static class, as static
	doesn't exist in 1.1.  (Thanks jb!)

2007-10-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxTextRenderer.cs: Abstract text measuring and drawing to this
	class to allow us to use different backends on different platforms.
	Linux uses the current [Draw|Measure]String backend.  Windows uses
	the TextRenderer.[Draw|Measure]Text backend, which uses GDI instead
	of GDI+.  This leads to better looking text and more accurate measurements
	on Windows, fixing many of the reported issues.
	* Line.cs, LineTag.cs: Update to use TextBoxTextRenderer.

2007-10-07  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs: When running on Windows,
	try to detect paths such "C:" and add Path.DirectorySeparatorChar,
	since we must match both "C:" and "C:\" forms. A little hackish, but
	works.
	Fixes #325247.

2007-10-07  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When calling EndEdit (after editing an item),
	create a new instance of LabelEditEventArgs to keep clean the fields
	in case we get a new call to BeginEdit; also do Application.DoEvents
	to have focus in synch. This is a fix similar to TreeView's #325244.

2007-10-07  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* HtmlDocument.cs, HtmlElement.cs, WebBrowser.cs: Added dom support
	* WebBrowserBase.cs: Added dialog support, calling the
	  WebBrowserDialogs classes for each specific dialog type.

2007-10-06  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When the last item is focused and is removed,
	move the focus to the previous item (in Items order). This is what MS
	does.
	Fixes #330415.

2007-10-06  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: In ListViewItemCollection, make Remove call RemoveAt,
	instead of the opposite (RemoveAt call Remove). This is a better
	approach since we don't need to to a pair of traversals when using
	RemoveAt.

2006-10-05  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: When Keys.Left is pressed, before trying to Collapse
	check that the node actually has nodes, and if not, move to the
	parent node instead. 
	Fixes #325265.

2006-10-05  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Move the previous change to the general case (to
	call Application.DoEvents in cases where the method was called by
	different places).

2007_10-05  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: When calling EndEdit and we need to hide the textbox,
	call Application.DoEvents. This is neccessary when we get a call to
	BeginEdit from an AfterLabelEdit handler, because the focus always
	goes to the TreeView, even if we try to give it to our
	LabelEditTextBox. The call do Application.DoEvents seems to
	synchronize the focus, basically.
	Fixes #325244.

2007-10-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: When AfterLabelEdit event is fired, TreeNode.IsEditing
	should be false. This also removes some nasty recursive paths. Fixes
	part of #325244.

2007-10-04  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: When cascade (layout) mdi window that is maximized, set the
	state to normal. Also resize window when cascading. Fixes #325433. 

2007-10-04  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: When SelectionColor is set to Color.Empty, use
	DefaultForeColor, as drawing empty colored lines isn't very useful.
	[Fixes the not drawn lines part of bug #324358]

2007-10-04  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Move Line and LineTag classes into separate files to
	make things easier to find.
	* Line.cs, LineTag.cs: Bring coding standards up to Mono's guidelines.
	* RichTextBox.cs: Capitalize LineTag.Length property access.
	- This is purely an organizational/formatting change, no logic changed. -

2007-10-03  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Do not show focus rectangle in radio buttons when
	text is empty.

2007-10-03  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Do not show focus rectangle in checkboxes when
	text is empty.

2007-10-03  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: On contructor use backgound_color instead of BackColor to
	prevent calling of OnBackColorChanged. Fixes #325321.

2007-10-03  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* TextBox.cs: When check enabled uses Enabled property instead of is_enabled
	because control can be disabled because owner is disabled.

2007-10-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: For the 1.1 profile, the default SelectedText is
	string.Empty, test failed from previous change.

2007-10-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: For the 1.1 profile, the default SelectedText
	is null, not String.Empty.  See bug #323038.

2007-10-01  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Change the margins to match MS a little better.
	Still not perfect for X11 due to some DrawString differences, but
	is still an improvement over the old stuff.
	Partially fixes #324467.

2007-09-30  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs: When using MyComputer as 
	RootFolder, let absolute paths be considered as valid ones. Also, use
	Path.DirectorySeparatorChar instead of Path.AltDirectorySeparatorChar,
	for Windows compatibility.
	Partially fixes #325247.

2007-09-29  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs: Fix the recursive FindPathInNodes method.
	Also remove the stack.Count > 0 check in FBTreeView.SetSelectedNode
	method, since it causes the dialog to not select folders directly
	under the root path (when setting SelectedPath property).

2007-09-29  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: When calling Expand/Collapse and need to call 
	ExpandBelow/CollapseBelow respectively, take into account
	partially visible nodes (previously Expanding/Collapsing
	a partially visible node in the bottom was not updating its +- sign).

2007-09-28  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: When calling Expand on a TreeNode, and we need to
	expand nodes below (ExpandBelow), scroll the entire Viewport
	area if the node is above it and not visible (instead of scrolling
	the area from node's Bottom, which applies only when the node is
	visible).
	Fixes #325266.

2007-09-28  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: When calling ExpandAll, set SelectedNode to the top
	node in the bottom area (as .Net does). This is done to preserve the
	scroll position when ExpandAll is called before handle is created for
	the 1.1 profile (bottom area, as opposed to top area in 2.0).
	Fixes #324103.

2007-09-28  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: When calling ExpandAll, don't move the scroll to the 
	bottom area if we are in fact not using the vertical scroll bar.
	Fixes #324824.

2007-09-27  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Comment out a double buffering optimization that doesn't
	take into account invalidates created in OnPaint, causing the control
	to never be redrawn.  It would take quite a bit of work to work around
	this, but I left it commented with an explanation for later possible
	optimization.
	[Fixes bug #328681]

2007-09-27  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Ask parent to perform a layout if control is AutoSize and
	the text changes.
	* RadioButton.cs: Implement GetPreferredSizeCore.
	[Fixes bug #328672]

2007-09-26  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs, TextBoxBase.cs, WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext.cs:
	corcompare stuffs.

2007-09-26  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Application.cs: Move the sync context stuff to Run instead of RunLoop
	so that it doesn't get uninstalled on modal forms.
	* Control.cs: Install a sync context when a control is created.
	* WindowsFormsSyncronizationContext.cs: Create a private static control
	to invoke on.  This is easier than trying to find a created control we
	can use.
	[Fixes bug #327608]

2007-09-25  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Application.cs: Install a WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext in the
	run loop, and uninstall it when done.
	* WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext.cs: Implement.
	[Fixes the common case in bug #327608]

2007-09-23  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* DataGridViewCellCollection.cs: Added argument checks for indexers.
	Use case-insensitive lookup of column name in indexer. Code
	formatting.

2007-09-21  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: When collapsing or expanding a node, check whether its
	change will affect the visible area (we were previously doing a
	IsVisible check, but that check is not enough since children nodes
	could be still visible). Fixes part of #325266.

2007-09-21  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Always select the first node when the TreeView gets
	focus if there is no currently selected node.
	[Fixes bug #324279]

2007-09-21  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Do not raise BeforeSelect or AfterSelect when the
	node being selected is null.
	[Patch from Yves Bastide fixes bug #326858]

2007-09-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Add an internal ArePreviousNodesExpanded, to know
	whether all the parent nodes are expanded.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: When adding a new node an calling SetupNode,
	call RecalculateVisibleOrder if all previous nodes are expanded.
	Before that we were doing a IsVisible check, but sometimes the node
	is not in the visible area, but _should_already be ready, because of
	all previous nodes are expanded. Fixes #325259.

2007-09-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripSplitButton.cs: Call the ButtonClick event if the button
	portion of the item is clicked.

2007-09-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Do not tell the system to move the cursor if the
	textbox isn't focused.  Fixes part of bug #322668.

2007-09-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: When there are no items, do not show the dropdown if
	the down arrow is clicked.  Fixes part of bug #322668.

2007-09-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripComboBox.cs: Manually set the size of this control in the
	constructor, as it doesn't seem to be the same as DefaultSize.
	Fixes a failing monobuild test.

2007-09-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DateTimePicker.cs: If the user sets MinDate to DateTime.MinValue,
	change it to DateTimePicker.MinDateTime.  [Fixes bug #326609]

2007-09-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Theme.cs: FileDialogs should be using DesktopDirectory instead of
	Desktop.  This lets it work for people who have moved their desktops
	from the default location on windows.  For people who have not, both
	values are the same, so it shouldn't hurt anything.  [Fixes bug #325270]

2007-09-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripControlHostTest.cs: DefaultSize is based off hosted control,
	but when the base constructor sets this, the control is null.  Set it
	again in the constructor.  Fixes a failing monobuild test.

2007-09-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripDropDownItem.cs: Make sure Click and DropDownOpened events
	get called.
	* ToolStripSplitButton.cs: Make sure MouseDown and MouseUp events get
	called.

2007-09-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Don't show tooltips for ToolStripTextBoxes, they
	will handle it themselves.
	* ToolStripItem.cs: When deciding what the text of a tooltip should
	be, use the Text property instead of the text field.
	* ToolStripTextBox.cs: Handle tooltips.
	[Fixes bugs #325417 and #325973]

2007-09-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripDropDownButton.cs: Only drop down overflow menu with a
	left click.  Fixes the easy part of bug #325969.

2007-09-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Set AutoSizeMode back to GrowAndShrink to refix
	bug #325406, but set a minimum for StatusStrip to 22 to keep
	bug #325390 fixed.  I think this minimum would have been figured
	up automatically if the grip was actually a ToolStripItem, but it
	currently is not.

2007-09-18  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: max_label_wrapping is now 30 pixels instead of 38,
	as this is apparently the actual value used by .Net. Also apply
	ItemPadding in Details view only, and decrease the general width padding,
	to have only the needed. This should fix #324340 in Windows too.

2007-09-18  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: Don't Invalidate item if parent is inside
	a BeginUpdate/EndUpdate block. This prevents to have differences
	between the ListView and items state, as well as avoid some exceptions
	there.
	* ListView.cs: Make 'updating' field internal.

2007-09-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripControlHost.cs: Realign control when ControlAlign changes.
	* ToolStripItem.cs: Use ImageScalingSize when calculating preferred
	size if appropriate.
	Fixes reopened bug #325414.

2007-09-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Set AutoSizeMode back to GrowOnly.
	* ToolStripItem.cs: Invalidate before and after our new autosize when
	text changes.
	Fixes reopened bug #325390.

2007-09-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripMenuItem.cs: Make sure we invalidate when clicked so
	mnemonics can be drawn or undrawn correctly.  Fixes reopened bug 
	#325044.

2007-09-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Do WM_CONTEXTMENU before OnMouseUp.  [Fixes bug #325535]

2007-09-14  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ColumnHeader.cs: When drawing column text, use EllipsisCharacter
	instead of EllipsisWord (by equistango at gmail.com). Fixes part of
	#82734.

2007-09-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Make ToolStrip selectable when TabStop = true.  Find an
	item to select when the ToolStrip is selected.
	* ToolStripControlHost: Realign the control when the bounds or visibility
	change.
	* ToolStripItem.cs: When selected, if it's a control host, focus the control.
	* ToolStripOverflow.cs: When laying out the drop down, respect the item's
	preferred height.
	* ToolStripTextBox.cs: OnPaintInternal should call base.OnPaintInternal, not
	base.OnPaint.  Was causing text not to be drawn.

2007-09-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* SplitterPanel.cs: Ignore attempts to set AutoSizeMode.

2007-09-13  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: When creating the label edit text box,
	set is initially to Visible = false. This is done to
	prevent a confusion in the layout which makes it to lose
	focus when shown the first time. Fixes part of #82592.

2007-09-13 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* WebBrowserBase.cs: add FocusOption enumeration for finer focus control

2007-09-13  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Take Margin into account when calculating preferred
	size.  Also, allow preferred size to get smaller than the explicit
	size.
	* ToolStripTextBox.cs: Don't change the GetPreferredSize implementation.
	First step towards fixing bug #82747.

2007-09-13  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Applied patch from latency@gmx.de to not paint the
	full row select background over the plus/minus glyph.  Also, turn
	off the focus rectangle for full row select since MS doesn't seem
	to ever paint it.  [Fixes bug #81839]

2007-09-13  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Don't FocusInternal if there is no selected item.
	This was causing keyboard opened dropdowns to lose focus.
	[Fixes bug #82803]

2007-09-13  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: If Rectangle.Empty is passed to Invalidate, use
	ClientRectangle instead.  [Fixes bug #82838]

2007-09-13  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* SplitContainer.cs: We can't reset Visible on every layout because
	someone may have set Visible = false explicitly on a SplitterPanel.
	Make sure when we switch orientation the SplitterDistance does not
	change.  Fixes two failing tests.

2007-09-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Use MeasureTextInternal instead of MeasureText in
	TextRenderer, since the latter is only available in 2.0.

2007-09-13  Ivan N. Zlatev <contact@i-nz.net>

	* Cursor.cs: Fix Cursor.Current to apply Cursor.Default.
	* SplitContainer.cs: Implement FixedPanel layouting.

2007-09-12  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* WebBrowserBase.cs: setup shutdown routine

2007-09-12  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Application.cs: Let keyboard events that are targetted 
		to non-mwf windows hosted inside mwf (as in, webbrowser),
		propagate properly. Fixes keyboard handling on the webbrowser.

2007-09-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When handling MouseUp event and we are 
	highligting a node with the mouse right button, don't trigger
	Before/AfterSelecting event, since we are not actually selecting
	the node.

2007-09-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: When editing a node, modify the edit text box
	depending on the text length (as you are typing), like MS does.

2007-09-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Fixup preferred size calculations for vertical toolbars. 
	Override GetPreferredSizeCore to perform calculations.  Remove custom
	autosize logic.  [Fixes bug #82739]

2007-09-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Modified should default to false.

2007-09-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Update the anchoring distances even when layout is supspended.
	Patch provided by George fixes bug #82805.

2007-09-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Provide a setter for ExplicitHeight.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Now that we have the implementation for explicit heights,
	remove the hacks in here for requested_height.
	[Fixes bug #82749]

2007-09-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs: Fix an issue reported on the lists where setting a scrollbar's
	Maximum to lower that its current Value caused an ArgumentException by setting
	the Value to the new Maximum.

2007-09-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Math is hard!  Fix some math so that the TrackBar
	handle moves to the closest tick when it is being dragged.
	[Fixes bug #82751]

2007-09-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripManager.cs: When we have added MDI buttons onto a MenuStrip, we
	can't let them count as real items when calculating where to merge in the
	user's items.  [Fixed bug #82786]

2007-09-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripMenuItem.cs: Add a parent type check so we don't crash on people
	who want to add a menu item directly onto a toolstrip.
	[Fixes bug #82775, part II]

2007-09-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* StatusStrip.cs: Synchronize SetDisplayedItems with the ToolStrip version.
	* ToolStrip.cs: If a ToolStripItem set to not visible is added to a ToolStrip,
	don't set it to available.
	* ToolStripItem.cs: When Visible is changed, tell the owner to perform a layout.
	[Fixes bug #82727, part II]

2007-09-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* StatusStrip.cs: Change item placement to None if not visible.
	* ToolStripItem.cs: Invalidate when InternalVisible changes.
	These should have been committed to fix 82723, but I missed them.

2007-09-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Make sure ItemClicked is raised before the ToolStripItem's
	Click, and that it is only called once.
	* ToolStripMenuItem.cs: Call OnClick even when there are dropdown items.
	* ToolStripDropDownItem.cs: Override HandleItemClick so dropdowns stay
	dropped down.
	[Fixes bug #82775]

2007-09-08  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ColumnHeaderSample.cs: Use 5 pixels as extra height instead of 8
	to match .Net.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: For the columns text, use 5 pixels as left padding
	instead of 8, just like above. Partially fixes #82734.

2007-09-08  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	Patch by Ernesto Carrea <equistango at gmail.com>. Partially 
	fixes #82734.

	* ListView.cs: Remove extra space between rows in Details view (match
	.Net). 
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Header text should use ListView.Font, not
	the DefaultFont.

2007-09-08  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Application.cs: Modified ProductVersion to return value of
	AssemblyInformationVersion if available, and fallback to assembly
	version. Fixes bug #82746. Code formatting.
	* BindingSource.cs: Remove NIE from Dispose, and mark it MonoTODO
	instead.

	* Control.cs: When updating ZOrder for a child control,
	take into account the implicit ones (we need it in our controls
	using them). Fixes #82642.

2007-09-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

2007-09-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: If AutoSize changes the size of our item, invalidate
	so we repaint using the new size.  [Fixes bug #82723]

2007-09-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs: If ShowLines is true, we should ignore the FullRowSelect
	option.  [Fixes bug #81779]

2007-09-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Override HandleClick because the StandardClick style is
	set to false.  According to MSDN (and testing), the click events should
	only be raised when the click occurs on a TreeNode.  [Fixes bug #81739]

2007-09-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripTextBox.cs: Invalidate our textbox when it loses focus, so
	the border will disappear.  Fixes reopened #82653.

2007-09-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: If the control is autosize, and its preferred size changes
	when it lays out its children, tell its parent so it can be re-layed out.
	Fixing some of the fallout from r85433.

2007-09-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Fix a NRE caused by r85427 because RadioButton
	and CheckBox share some code.

2007-09-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TrackBar.cs: Only call OnScroll if we actually changed the Value of
	the TrackBar, not every mouse move.  [Fixed bug #82718]

2007-09-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Allow a CheckBox to be rendered like a Button
	under 2.0 rendering.  [Fixes bug #82657]

2007-09-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs: If we found a TreeNode to display a context menu, but
	it doesn't have one to show, let the TreeView display its menu
	instead.  [Fixes bug #82680]

2007-09-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripTextBox.cs: TextBox no longer call OnPaint, we need to use
	OnPaintInternal instead.  Give the internal TextBox a Border property
	so it can draw itself more correctly.  [Fixes bug #82653]

2007-09-06  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@gmail.com>

	* HtmlHistory.cs HtmlWindow.cs HtmlWindowCollection.cs ListBindingHelper.cs WindowsFormsSection.cs WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext.cs: Stubs for missing 2.0 classes.

	(Theme.ListViewItemPaddingWidth) to have working AutoResize on
	columns again.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	* Theme.cs: Likewise.

2007-08-30  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When a ListViewSubItem instance is invalidated,
	invoke Invalidate on parent ListViewItem, not parent ListView.
	Fixes #81570.

2007-08-30  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ListView.cs, ListViewItem.cs: corcompare stuffs.

2007-08-30  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* HtmlElementErrorEventArgs.cs, HtmlElementErrorEventHandler.cs: Added.

2007-08-29  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TabControl.cs: I was looking into the MonoTODO on TabPageCollection.
	Add (string,string,string) to implement the imagekey.  It turns out, we
	use the requested imagekey whereas .Net does not.  So I broke ours to match
	theirs.  :(

2007-08-29  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs, UserControl.cs: Override ValidateChildren, AutoValidate.

2007-08-29  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

2007-08-29  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Add/fix some override differences between 1.1 and 2.0,
	as well as add new ones. This should make work the BackgroundImage
	property for ListView again.

2007-08-28  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DataGrid.cs, DataGridViewButtonColumn.cs, DataGridViewCheckBoxColumn.cs,

	[Fixes bug #82590]

2007-08-27  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Add some 2.0 overrides.

2007-08-27  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: Uses opacity var instead of Opacity property in CreateHandle
	because getter dont returns right value before handle creation. Thanks 
	to George. Fixes #82569.  

2007-08-27  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* Theme.cs: Revert last patch, it causes error under win32. 

2007-08-27  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* Theme.cs: Uses Environment.SpecialFolder.DesktopDirectory instead of 
	Environment.SpecialFolder.Desktop in Places method, Desktop returns the 
	logical Desktop rather than the physical file system location. Fixes #82603. 

2007-08-26  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MessageBox.cs: Add clipboard copy (ctrl+c) to messagebox. Thanks Andy Hume
	for the patch. Fixes #82568.

	methods.

2007-08-26  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewInsertionMark.cs: New stubbed class.

2007-08-25  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs: When adding folder, immediately create the
	directory with temporary name and rename the directory when editing
	finishes. This matches MS. Ensure the node for the new folder is 
	selected and LabelEdit is disabled, when editing is either finished
	or cancelled.

2007-08-25  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TreeView.cs: When editing label of node, ensure node is visible.

2007-08-25  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: Set the value only if it has changed.

2007-08-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Some more code refactoring to add support sorting
	with groups (now for Details view). Remove unused code also.

2007-08-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* NodeLabelEditEventArgs.cs: EndEdit immediately when CancelEdit is called.
	Not a big fan of reacting immediately to a field in an EventArg, but that's
	the way it's done.  (This is part of the previous commit that got left out.)

2007-08-25  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs: Removed need for separate description field.
	Replaced "" with string.Empty. Fixed tabindex. Ensure OK button
	has focus when dialog box is displayed again, regardless of what
	button was pressed the previous time. Set RootFolder and SelectedPath
	each time dialog box is displayed. This ensures the treeview is
	refreshed, and fixes bug #82579. Do no hide selected node in TreeView
	when it does not have focus. Added support for more special folders.

2007-08-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Create a CancelEdit method.  Clone the edit_args in EndEdit
	before calling AfterLabelEdit.  If the user calls BeginEdit in that event,
	it resets the edit_args.
	* TreeNode.cs: Call CancelEdit if the user passes cancel = true to EndEdit.
	[Fixes bug #82577]

2007-08-24  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs: Modifies form caption and text of new folder
	button to match MS. Provide more meaningful exception message for
	invalid RootFolder value. Use zero-length string when SelectedPath
	is set to null. Allow non-rooted paths in SelectedPath, but ignore
	them in FolderBrowserTreeView. Allow folders to be created in
	RootFolder. Fixes bug #82576.

2007-08-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Correctly compute the layout_ht (height) when using groups,
	since we need to take into account the group headers and the margin
	between them.
	* ListViewGroup.cs: Add a rows field to store the number of rows per
	group.

2007-08-24  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DateTimePicker.cs: The MS' MTB has a really stupid year formatting.
	  Anyways, let's just follow the lead.

2007-08-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* CheckBox.cs: Set the AutoSizeMode to GrowAndShrink.
	* Form.cs, GroupBox.cs: Don't skip Right or Bottom anchored 
	controls in GetPreferredSizeCore.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Tweak text drawing of CheckBoxes.
	[Fixes bug #82488]

2007-08-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* PrintDialog.cs: Need to instantiate the form variable here too.

2007-08-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Do some reorganization to support sorting in groups,
	by doing the layout sequentially in ListView.Items. Also add support
	for the Default Group, which should be available for items with no
	group assigned.
	* ListViewGroup.cs: Add support for DefaultGroup. Include new members
	for storing layout info also.
	* ListViewGroupCollection.cs: Add a DefaultGroup as part of the
	collection, as well as providing internal members to do a traversal
	including the default group (needed when doing layout/drawing).
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: When drawing group headers use internal
	ListViewGroupCollection members to take into account the default
	group.

2007-08-23  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* FlowLayoutPanel.cs: Add GetPreferredSizeCore.  [Fixes bug #82537]

2007-08-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs: IsInputKey: don't ask for any keys if the handle hasn't
	been created.  If handle is created, we want arror keys.  If we are editing
	a node, we want things like enter, esc, home, end, page up, page down.
	Allows Esc to work for FolderBrowserDialog.

2007-08-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ColorDialog.cs, FontDialog.cs: Set the form's CancelButton so that
	they close when ESC is pressed.  Thanks Andy!

2007-08-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* CommonDialog.cs: Do not instantiate form, leave that for derived classes.
	This way we can tell if this is a CommonDialog provided with mono, or one
	that is being implemented outside by a developer.  If it is an external one,
	the developer is responsible for showing their own form.  We were showing
	our blank form after the developer showed his.
	* ColorDialog.cs, FileDialog.cs, FolderBrowserDialog.cs, FontDialog.cs,
	PageSetupDialog.cs: Instantiate form variable in our constructor.
	[Fixes bug #82531]

2007-08-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ListBox.cs, ListView.cs, TreeView.cs: Override IsInputCharInternal
	and always return true.  [Fixes bug #81616]

2007-08-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Allow 2.0 AutoSize to change the height of the
	TextBox.  [Fixes bug #82549]

2007-08-23  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* FileDialog.cs: When Save/Open is clicked and no filename is selected
	or entered then do not close the dialog. Fixes bug #82539. Removed
	CWLs.

2007-08-22  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Create UpdateRecentFiles and move the recent files refresh
	code to this method. It is calling every time filter changes. This method
	will help to fix the bug #80887.

2007-08-22  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* CheckBox.cs: Implement AutoSize calculation.

2007-08-22  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* CheckBox.cs: Use new 2.0 rendering for 2.0.
	* Theme.cs: Method declarations for 2.0 rendering path.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: 2.0 rendering implementation for CheckBox.

2007-08-21  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewGroupCollection.cs: Fix a typo of the previous patch.

2007-08-21  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewGroupCollection.cs: Implement AddRange the right way, to
	only call Redraw on the parent one time.

2007-08-21  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DataGridViewRowHeaderCell.cs, DataGridViewColumnHeaderCell.cs: Implemented
	  GetClipboardContent.
	* DataGridViewCell.cs: Implemented GetClipboardContent,
	  GetEditedFormattedValue, GetFormattedValue.

	* DataObject.cs: Implemented retrieval of convertible / not convertible
	  objects.

2007-08-21  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: When changing the item's text, invalidate before we resize
	ourselves.  This ensures the entire old bounds are repainted, in case our new
	size is smaller.  [Fixes bug #82518]

2007-08-20  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Apply patch from #81588, it makes use of PointerMotionHintMask
	flag to make fast handle of mouse events, without this the mouse move is
	handled in some manner, whether it is a mouse move or not. Fixes #81588.

2007-08-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When doing layout calculations don't use a ref
	param to keep the current item; instead use its Index value (this 
	is specially important when doing the layout with Groups
	and Items being sparse). Also don't take into account items added to
	the Group but not yet added to the main ListView.Items collection.

2007-08-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewGroupCollection.cs: Forgot to mimic an issue
	in the indexer (don't assign the ListView owner for new values).

2007-08-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewGroupCollection.cs: Make the string indexer use
	the int based indexer to re-use code, instead of duplicate the code.
	Also Redraw as needed and take into account null values.

2007-08-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* StatusStrip.cs: Make sure the item's parent gets set in SetDisplayedItems.
	[Fixes bug #82481]

2007-08-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Add some logic to un-focus controls in ToolStripControlHosts
	when other buttons are clicked or navigated to.

2007-08-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Treat toolwindows as if they had no window manager, since
	  it's XplatUIX11 that attaches them.

2007-08-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DataGridView.cs: If a column has been added, recreate the editing row.
	  Fixes #82226.

2007-08-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* TextControl.cs: Use Math.Max instead of Math.Min when deciding the length
	  of the tag to draw. Makes disappearing text show up again.

2007-08-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* StatusBar.cs: Take into account any icons when a panel has AutoSize =
	  Contents. Fixes #82487.

2007-08-19  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Added HtmlElement.cs, HtmlElementCollection.cs, 
	  HtmlElementEventArgs.cs, HtmlElementEventHandler.cs
	  
2007-08-19  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* BindingSource.cs: Implement this, dispose and getenumerator.
	* DataGridViewRowCollection.cs: Move the InvalidOperationException
	out of AddInternal, throw it only on public Add calls. The 
	UsingWebBrowser sample was blowing up with this when setting the
	DataSource after adding DataBindings, so it's likely that .net
	only throws this exception when Add is called directly.	
	
	* ToolStripControlHost.cs: Return the hosted control's text
	property, and not the ToolStripItem one (it would always return
	the initial value).
	
	* HtmlDocument.cs: Implement GetElementById and All
	* WebBrowser.cs: Remove exception on set_DocumentStream.	

2007-08-19  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: Fix the max and min value for opacity (0~1).

2007-08-19  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	[Fixes #80118]
	* DataGridTableStyle.cs: Default header font is now null, on getter it 
	returns datagrid font when is null. On setter permits null.

	* DataGrid.cs:
	- When ResetHeaderFont set header font to null.
	- On EndInit set grid_style.DataGrid.

2007-08-19  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

2007-08-19  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	not 2. Fixes #82229.

2007-08-18  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Fix tab size when image height is less than text height.
	Partially fixes #81837.

2007-08-18  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: Add WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT to forms to make it selectable using 
	"alt + tab". It works only for Win32, for X11 theres no way to remove window
	from taskbar and keep it on "alt_tab". Fixes #81722.

2007-08-18  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Apply patch from Jurek Bartuszek to fix DrawReversibleFrame
	and DrawReversibleLine, also apply same behavior to FillReversibleRectangle. 
	Fixes #80877 and #79418.

2007-08-18  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Fix popup menu position when the size is larger than distance 
	between position and one of the screen borders. Fixes #82349.

2007-08-18  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MessageBox.cs: When there is no form that invoked the MessageBox, shows
	the MessageBox in the taskbar. Fixes #82457.

2007-08-18  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* MessageBox.cs: Fix form size when icon is set and text height is bigger
	than icon. Fixes #82468.

2007-08-18  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: A FixedToolWindow has border size 3.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Change HandleCalcSize to return a boolean value
	  if handled or not. Implement WM_NCCALCSIZE for WParam == 0 as well.
	  Refactored HandleNCCalcSize somewhat to avoid code duplication.
	* Form.cs: Add is_clientsize_set, set in set_ClientSize, used by
	  FormBorderStyle to decide if we're calculating a new size from the
	  client size or not. CreateParams: Don't fake tool windows, only the X11
	  backend manages toolwindows manually.

2007-08-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Only reset is_visible if !IsDisposed to prevent an
	ObjectDisposedException.

2007-08-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Reset is_visible back to true after OnLoad.  Setting this
	in OnLoad should not have any effect.  [Fixes bug #82470]

2007-08-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolTip.cs: Add a hack to ToolTipWindow so it will still size and
	paint for controls that create their own ToolTipWindow instead of
	going through ToolTip.

2007-08-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolTip.cs: Make Hide internal instead of public to match MS API.

2007-08-17  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewGroupCollection.cs: Use generic List instead of an
	ArrayList, since this collection is 2.0 only.

2007-08-17  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* ToolTip.cs (Hide): Made public to make the build work (should
	this not be public?).

2007-08-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolBar.cs, ToolStrip.cs, TreeView.cs: Use a ToolTip instead of a
	ToolTipWindow.
	* ToolTip.cs: Add an internal Visible property to facilitate transition.

2007-08-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DrawToolTipEventArgs.cs, DrawToolTipEventHandler.cs, PopupEventArgs.cs,
	PopupEventHandler.cs: Make these internal for 1.1.
	* ThemeClearlooks.cs, ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Use TextRenderer, and modify to not
	use ToolTipWindow internals.
	* ToolTip.cs: Add 2.0 modal Show methods.  Had to move a lot of stuff around to
	support this.  A lot of stuff in the ToolTipWindow got moved to the ToolTip.

2007-08-17  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* X11Dnd.cs: Add a null check.

2007-08-17  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* X11Dnd.cs: MwfWindow: Try to load the control directly from the handle if
	  nothing else succeeds. Fixes #82453.

2007-08-17  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: PaintEventStart: validate the entire source client
	  rectangle if we're painting to another window than the one the paint
	  message was generated on. Simplify the code somewhat, which makes
	  PaintEventEnd also simpler.

2007-08-17  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: When changing parent of a form, let the form decide whether
	  XplatUI.SetParent should be called or not.
	* Form.cs: ChangingParent: only call XplatUI.SetParent if we're not
	  recreating the handle. If the new parent's handle isn't created, don't
	  recreate our handle, just destroy it. CreateParams: Check if the
	  parent's handle is created before fetching it.

2007-08-17  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs, Form.cs, InternalWindowManager.cs, MainMenu.cs, MdiClient.cs:
	  Update calls to PaintEventStart/End to take a Message argument.
	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs: Update PaintEventStart/End to
	  take a Message argument.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs, XplatUIX11.cs: Update PaintEventStart/End to take a
	  Message argument, and handle the case where we don't paint to the window
	  for which the paint message was generated.

2007-08-17  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Don't call Win32GetLastError directly, use
	  Marshal.GetLastWin32Error. Plug nasty memory leak in
	  PaintEventStart/End, we were creating a DC we weren't releasing.

2007-08-17  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Add Groups support in Details view. Also have a small
	method to do the layout of the group header. Don't use a separate
	method to do the groups calculation in Icons view, since our methods
	are now a little simpler.
	* ListViewGroup.cs: Use the more accurate `HeaderBounds' name than
	`Bounds'.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Likewise.

2007-08-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Application.cs: Add FilterMessage method and rework our message loop
	logic to use it.

2007-08-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Application.cs: Add some methods and stub a few methods that are
	pretty much never used.

2007-08-15  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Add some serialization methods.

2007-08-14  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: In ListViewItemCollection have a 
	'is_main_collection' field to not modify ListViewItem.ListView
	when using it as ListViewGroup.Items (and not ListView.Items)
	and also don't modify selection state (.Net behaviour). 
	Instead, set group for items contained in a ListViewGroup.Items collection.
	* ListViewItem.cs: Simplify some code in Group setter.
	* ListViewGroup.cs: use the new .ctor to pass the current instance
	to the ItemsCollection.
	* ListViewGroup.cs: Set the ListView property for ListViewGroup
	instances when adding/removing. Also make Remove use RemoveAt, which
	should perform better.

2007-08-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Message.cs, TabControl.cs, TextBox.cs, TextBoxBase.cs: Hide some 2.0 API
	that crept into the 1.1 profile.

2007-08-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolBarButton.cs: Implement ImageKey.

2007-08-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolBar.cs: Implement ScaleControl/ScaleCore.

2007-08-13  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* PictureBox.cs: OnAnimateImage/UpdateAnimateImage: Check if handle is still
	  created, it might have gotten destroyed since we last checked. Fixes
	  #82405.

2007-08-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolTip.cs: Remove mouse in control check from mouseleave handler so
	tooltip will hide when mouse is moved off the control.
	[Fixes bug #82407]

2007-08-11 Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* WebBrowserBase.cs, WebBrowser.cs: add implementation
	using Mono.Mozilla for loading and navigating webcontrol
	with xulrunner.
	The initial implementation was done on 
	/trunk/mozembed/tests/browser , and copied here.

2007-08-11  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: On 2.0 profile, use ForeColor and BackColor of
	ToolTipWindow for drawing the tooltip. Fixes bug #82408.

2007-08-10  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DataGridView.cs: Add support for an editing row. Fixes #82226.
	  RowTemplateFull: throw an exception if a column doesn't have a template.
	* DataGridViewRowCollection.cs: AddInternal: if there are any editing rows,
	  add the row just before it.
	* DataGridViewTextBoxCell.cs: Don't paint cells which are in edit mode as
	  selected.
	* DataGridViewSelectedRowCollection.cs: Don't return the editing row. Add a
	  DataGridView field to be able to reach the grid's editing row.

2007-08-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolTip.cs: If the control's handle hasn't been created when it has a
	tooltip set on it, don't check to see if we need to show the tooltip.  This
	check was causing the control's handle to be created.
	[Fixes bug #82399]

2007-08-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Fix SelectionLength when no text selected to match MS:
					1.1		2.0
	Handle Not Created	-1		0
	Handle Created		0		0
	[Fixes bug #82371]

2007-08-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolTip.cs: Hide the tooltip if the control is clicked to match MS behavior.
	[Fixes bug #82348]

2007-08-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* DrawToolTipEventArgs.cs: Don't dispose a brush we got from the respool.
	* ToolTip.cs: Implement some properties and owner draw.

2007-08-09  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DataGridView.cs: OnPaint: don't set scrollbar visibility to false then
	  show them again, since setting visibility causes a paint, causing an
	  endless loop (instead use a temporary and set it all when it's known if
	  they should be shown or not). Fixes #79265.

2007-08-09  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DataGridView.cs: Only do a full column/row selection if a header was
	  clicked and we're in Column/RowHeader selection mode. If shift and ctrl
	  isn't pressed, deselect everything before selecting something.

2007-08-09  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DataGridView.cs: Fix SelectedRows and SelectedColumns to match MS
	  behaviour according to bug #81075 - they are returned in the order they
	  are selected. Fix HitTest to check if the point is within any of the
	  headers. Allow for row/column selection when in ColumnHeader or
	  RowHeader selection mode. Add SetSelected[Column|Row]CoreInternal for
	  the row and column to call when their selected state changes, and
	  updated selected_[rows|columns] whenever SetSelected* is called.
	* DataGridViewBand.cs: Initialize isRow correctly. Call
	  SetSelected[Row|Column]CoreInternal when the selected state changes, and
	  add a SelectedInternal to avoid StackOverflows.
	* DataGridViewColumn.cs, DataGridViewRow.cs: If DGV is ReadOnly, we're also
	  ReadOnly no matter what.
	* DataGridViewSelectedColumnCollection.cs,
	  DataGridViewSelectedRowCollection.cs: Add an InternalAddRange that adds
	  the items in reverse order (just as MS does...)

2007-08-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Application.cs: Only release menustrips if Alt (MenuKey) is pressed by
	itself, not part of a mnemonic.  [Fixes bug #82378]

2007-08-09  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DataGridView.cs: BeginEdit: don't allow editing of readonly cells.
	* DataGridViewCell.cs: Implement ReadOnly better: the cell is ReadOnly if
	  the DGV, the column, the row, or the cell itself is readonly.

2007-08-09  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ThemeNice.cs: Use XplatUI.RunningOnUnix instead of checking
	OSVersion.Platform.
	* FileDialog.cs: Same.
	* TextRendered.cs: Same.
	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs: Same.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Same.
	* Application.cs: Same.
	* Cursors.cs: Same.
	* ThemeClearLooks.cs: Same.

2007-08-09  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* XplatUI.cs: Added RunningOnUnix property to be used by controls
	instead of duplicating these checks everywhere.
	* FileDialog.cs: Use case-insensitive comparison for populating the
	DirComboBox when not running on unix. Fixes bug #82385.
	* OpenFileDialog.cs: to match MS, change label of DirComboBox to 
	"Look in".

2007-08-09  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DataGridView.cs: SelectedRows: we need to check if selectionMode is
	  FullRowSelect (not FullColumnSelect). Fixes #81075. Implemented
	  BeginEdit, EndEdit, SetSelected<Cell|Row|Column>Core. Implemented row,
	  cell and column selection with ctrl and shift pressed. Call the correct
	  BeginEdit/EndEdit whenever we start/end editing. Move painting code to
	  the corresponding virtual method (PaintBackground to paint background,
	  etc).
	* DataGridViewCell.cs: Implement Selected correctly, we're selected if
	  either the column, row or the cell itself is selected.
	* DataGridViewRowCollection.cs: Use DGV.OnRowsAddedInternal instead of
	  OnRowsAdded.
	* DataGridViewRow.cs: Moved some of the painting code from DataGridView
	  here. When the row is selected, don't select all cells. Each cell now
	  queries the row to see if the row is selected.

2007-08-09  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DataGridViewColumn.cs: Throw if the SortMode conflicts with DataGridView's
	  SelectionMode.

2007-08-08  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: In ListViewItemsCollection check that owner is
	not null before trying to access it (this happens quite often
	using Groups). Also don't duplicate calls by calling CollectionChanged
	method.

2007-08-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Record if we were activated by mouse or keyboard.  Redraw
	when we are dismissed to clear keyboard mnemonics.
	* MenuStrip.cs, ToolStripDropDown.cs, ToolStripItem.cs, 
	ToolStripMenuItem.cs: Record if we were activated by mouse or keyboard.
	* ToolStripItemTextRenderEventArgs.cs: Draw mnemonic underlines if menu
	was activated by keyboard or the OS tells us to always draw them.
	* ToolStripManager.cs: Setup storage for activated by mouse or keyboard.
	[Fixes bugs #82376, #82377]

2007-08-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: If no one accepts a mnemonic, let the MenuStrip have a 
	shot at having it because Alt was pressed.
	* MenuStrip.cs: When handling Alt, don't select a SystemMenuItem, select
	the first real menu item.
	* ToolStrip.cs: Don't crash when looking for a ToolStripItem to handle
	a mnemonic if Text is null.
	[Fixes bug #82374]

2007-08-08  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: In ListViewItemCollection.AddItem, don't do a linear
	search do check whether the item is already contained in the
	collection or not; instead check if the owner of the item is the same
	as ours. Also, remove a redundant check in the same method. 

2007-08-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Allow the clip region to be set back to null.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: If we are sent a null clip region, use IntPtr.Zero.
	[Fixes button still showing up in bug #82370 when Show Through is turned off]

2007-08-08  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* GridEntry.cs: Add a null check.
	* PropertyGrid.cs: When checking for existing grid entries, ignore category
	  entries. Fixes #82297.

2007-08-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* OwnerDrawPropertyBag.cs: Make the serialization constructor protected
	for 2.0.

2007-08-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Implement ScaleControl.

2007-08-07  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs: Add a few ActiveMenu null checks. ActiveMenu might be null if we
	  have a menu strip.
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Don't create a maximized menu if the child or it's
	  parent has a menu strip. Fixes #81689.

2007-08-07  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* ToolTip.cs: We don't get mouse events on all platforms in the exact same
	  moments, so apply some fuzzy logic to determine if the mouse is still
	  inside a control or not. Fixes #82288 (for the third time).

2007-08-07  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: CreateControl: create implicit children as well. Fixes #82344.
	  Don't create the child if it has been disposed already (may happen if
	  the user closes the form the Load event).

2007-08-07  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* ToolTip.cs: If ReshowDelay is 0, show the tooltip immediately. Fixes
	  #82288.

2007-08-07  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: Add a null check in OnParentBindingContextChanged. The parent
	  might call us after we've been destroyed, in which case our own private
	  parent field is null. Fixes #82326.

2007-08-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripDropDown.cs: Fix a failing test on X11 by adding a null
	check for setting the dropdown's owner.

2007-08-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Fix some failing tests on X11 by adding a null check
	before removing system menu items.

2007-08-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* MdiClient.cs, MdiWindowManager.cs: Support 2.0 Mdi MenuStrip
	folding.
	* MdiControlStrip.cs: Added.  These are the menu items used in mdi
	folding.
	* ToolStrip.cs: Add a null check to mnemonics.
	* ToolStripDropDownMenu.cs: When using a SystemMenuItem, there is
	no ConnectedArea.
	[Fixes most of bug #81689]

2007-08-02  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* PropertyGrid.cs: Add a null-check. Fixes #82289/SVGPad.

2007-08-02  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	Use InitialDelay if ReshowDelay is zero. Fixes #82288.

2007-08-01  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DataGridViewCell.cs: EditType: returns
	  DataGridViewTextBoxEditingControl always.

2007-08-01  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextRenderer.cs: Remove the LineLimit string format flag from the
	DrawString fallback method so that things like buttons that aren't
	tall enough to draw a full line will still draw part of the text.
	[Fixes part of bug #82272]

2007-08-01  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DataGridView.cs: Implemented AutoResizeColumn(s).
	* DataGridViewCellStyle.cs: Added SetAlignment, fills in a StringFormat
	  according to the Alignment.
	* DataGridViewColumnHeaderCell.cs, DataGridViewTextBoxCell.cs:
	  Implement alignment and padding when painting.
	* DataGridViewRow.cs: SetValues: Don't create a cell if it already
	  exists.
	* DataGridViewCell.cs: Implement BorderWidths in the most primitive
	  way.
	* DataGridViewColumnCollection.cs: Raise OnColumnAdded on the DGV when
	  a column is added.

2007-07-31  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Use Control.ExplicitBounds instead of explicit_bounds,
	which is internal.

2007-07-31  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Stub out drag and drop methods, fix some corcompare stuff,
	hide GetPreferredSize from public API.
	* ToolStripDropDown.cs: Override AllowItemReorder, fix AccessibleObject.
	* ToolStripItem.cs: Stub out drag and drop methods and events.
	* ToolStripManager.cs: Stub out Save/LoadSettings.
	* ToolStripOverflow.cs: Use renamed ToolStrip.GetPreferredSize.
	* ToolStripPanel.cs: Fix corcompare error.
	* ToolStripPanelRow.cs: Use renamed ToolStrip.GetPreferredSize.
	* ToolStripSplitButton.cs: Fix AccessibleObject stuff.
	* ToolStripSplitStackLayout.cs: Use renamed ToolStrip.GetPreferredSize.

2007-07-31  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: In our new GetPreferredSizeCore, return the explicit
	bounds height instead of PreferredHeight.  Puts things back the way 
	they were for height while still fixing the width.  Fixes broken unit
	tests.

2007-07-31  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Binding.cs: Implement 2.0 constructors and add a null check.

2007-07-31  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DataGridViewRowCollection.cs: Allow a null DGV in the constructor,
	  and fix row index (off by one).

2007-07-31  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* PropertyGridView.cs: Remove debug output.

2007-07-31  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: We need to reset the is_created flags when the handle is
	  destroyed. Fixes #82187.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: In GetWindowRect don't offset screen coordinates to
	  client coordinates if the window doesn't have a parent.
	  Win32GetParent returns the parent or the owner, and for top-level
	  windows with no parent (but with an owner) we were calculating the
	  location from the location of the owner.
	* Form.cs: Remove incorrect fix for #82187. Don't raise OnLoad if the
	  form has been disposed.
	* MdiClient.cs: Add a null-check.

2007-07-30  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: TextBoxBase reports itself at AutoSize, but doesn't
	actually do auto-sizing.  Override the internal GetPreferredSizeCore 
	so we can provide an implementation that returns the current width
	and preferred height.  Allows anchor = right to work with TextBox 2.0.
	[Fixes bug #82233]

2007-07-30  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Add support for navigating items in Groups mode, by
	creating a big matrix containing all rows and cols of all groups. When
	are in other mode than Details, pressing Up should have a similar
	behaviour as that one of Down (moving to the next available column if
	current one doesn't have an item in the requested row). Also, don't
	proceed to use groups if ShowGroups is false.
	* ListViewGroup.cs: Add an internal int field to store the starting
	row of the group (used by the big matrix used for navigating the
	ListView).
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Don't draw headers if ListView.ShowGroups is
	false.

2007-07-30  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripDropDown.cs: When we do Show, start with the 
	DefaultDropDownDirection, but if our popup menu is going to off-screen,
	modify the direction to keep it on screen.  [Fixes bug #82210]

2007-07-29  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* FileDialog.cs: Accept any FilterIndex value, and store it
	unmodified. When FilterIndex is less than 1, or greater than number
	of filters, then default to first filter. Only add filter extension to
	file if user did not specifiy an extension. When type of dialog is
	OpenFileDialog and DefaultExt is set, then only use filter extension
	if: CheckFileExists is true and no file wih the default extension
	exists, or CheckFileExists is false, and user specified file does not
	exist. When CheckFileExists is true, then add first extension of 
	selected filter that matches existing file. Perform checks for
	existing file, overwrite and create after extension has been added to
	file name. When CheckFileExists is true and type is SaveFileDialog,
	then only consider first filter extension if DefaultExt is set.
	When CheckFileExists is true, then ignore DefaultExt if file with that
	extension does not exist. Also perform check for existing file when
	type is SaveFileDialog. Changed some field to constants.

2007-07-27  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Take into account the region used by header
	control when doing the vertical scroll (this way we invalidate
	the precise area, and don't get any dirty one).

2007-07-27  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Check for valid filterIndex on button open/save. 
	Fixes #82184.

2007-07-27  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Update some layout calculations in details view
	and clean the code in a pair of assignations.

2007-07-26  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ComboBox.cs, ContainerControl.cs, DataGrid.cs, FontDialog.cs, Label.cs,
	LinkLabel.cs, ListBox.cs, ListView.cs, ListViewItem.cs, MessageBox.cs,
	MonthCalender.cs, StatusBar.cs, ThemeClearlooks.cs, ThemeWin32Class.cs,
	ToolBar.cs, TreeView.cs: First pass at using thread-safe string measuring.

2007-07-26  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextRenderer.cs: Use [ThreadStatic] instead of locks to improve
	performance of thread-safe Graphic methods.  (Thanks rolf!)

2007-07-26  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When doing the layout calculations, don't calculate
	scroll bars before handle is created. This is unnecessary and also
	calculating them before handle creation item causes a number of random
	bugs (which begin to appear after Chris' big patch for handle creation
	fixes). 

2007-07-26  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextRenderer.cs: Create thread-safe versions of Graphics.MeasureString
	for things that don't have a Graphics object.  Currently, things just use
	the static Hwnd.bmp_g which is not thread safe.

2007-07-26  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs: ShowDialog: don't destroy handles if the dialog is a common
	  dialog. Fixes #82187.

2007-07-26  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DataGridViewElement.cs: Initialize state.
	* DataGridView.cs: Forward a few Mouse events to cells. Add
	  GetRowInternal and GetCellInternal that doesn't unshare rows.
	  Implement GetCellDisplayRectangle. HitTest: if the row is shared,
	  don't use the index, but look it up. Add
	  DataGridViewControlCollection.RemoveInternal to remove controls
	  that Remove won't remove (scrollbars, edit control).
	* DataGridViewColumn.cs: Initialize State correctly.
	* DataGridViewColumnHeaderCell.cs, DataGridViewComboBoxCell.cs,
	  DataGridViewHeaderCell.cs, DataGridViewRowHeaderCell.cs: Started
	  implementing this.
	* DataGridViewRowCollection.cs: Implemented shared rows.
	* DataGridViewRow.cs: Throw exceptions as MS do.
	* DataGridViewCell.cs: A few properties are implemented by a
	  Get<Property> method, so move implementation there and remove the
	  NIEX in the method. Add a bunch of OnXInternal that DataGridView
	  calls when necessary.
	* DataGridViewComboBoxEditingControl.cs: Remove a few NIEX'es that just
	  complicates matters.
	* DataGridViewCellCollection.cs: Add a GetCellInternal that doesn't
	  unshare any rows.

2007-07-25  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* UpDownBase.cs: We cannot override SetBoundsCore for 2.0, which was relayout-ing
	the children controls.  Instead, we will just set up the proper docking for the
	children controls so we don't have to worry about it.  [Fixes bug #82188]

2007-07-25  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs, NodeLabelEditEventArgs.cs, LabelEditTextBox.cs: Support edit
	canceling and correct Before/AfterLabelEdit properties as layed out in bug
	81847.  [Fixes bug #81847]

2007-07-25  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Label.cs: If AutoSize = true and a width or height is set, ignore it and
	redo the autosize.  VS2005 defaults to setting the AutoSize, and then setting
	an explicit size based on the design-time size of the text.  Since our fonts
	may not match this explicit size, we tend to cut off the ends of people's labels.

2007-07-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Menu.cs: Add some missing methods to MenuItemCollection.

2007-07-24  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DataGridView.cs: Added RowTemplateFull, creates a row from the templates in the columns.
	* DataGridViewBand.cs: DefaultHeaderCellType: initialize correctly. Resizable: if not set, check DGV.
	* DataGridViewColumn.cs: InheritedAutoSizeMode: if not set, check DGV. Resizable: delegate to base class. ToolTipText: Never return null. Initialize a few other properties correctly.
	* DataGridViewColumnCollection.cs: Add: Default column is a TextBoxColumn.
	* DataGridViewComboBoxCell.cs: Started implementing this, lots left still.
	* DataGridViewElement.cs: State defaults to Visible.
	* DataGridViewRowCollection.cs: Add: creates the new row based on a template.
	* DataGridViewTextBoxColumn.cs: SortMode: delegate to base class, but initialize to Automatic. ToString: implement correctly.

2007-07-24  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: Minor 1.1 corcompare fix.

2007-07-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* LinkLabel.cs, PrintPreviewDialog.cs, TabPage.cs, TextBox.cs,
	TextBoxBase.cs, ToolBar.cs: 2.0 corcompare work.

2007-07-23  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DataGridViewLinkColumn.cs, DataGridViewRowCollection.cs,
	  DataGridViewImageColumn.cs, DataGridViewSelectedCellCollection.cs,
	  DataGridViewComboBoxCell.cs, DataGridViewLinkCell.cs,
	  DataGridViewSelectedColumnCollection.cs,
	  DataGridViewSelectedRowCollection.cs: Corcompare work.

2007-07-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* PrintDialog.cs: Stub UseEXDialog.  I chose to stub this because
	it is autoset by VS2005 designer and the effect is barely noticeable.

2007-07-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Implement HitTest.

2007-07-23  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DataGridViewTextBoxCell.cs: Use DGV.EditControlInternal instead of
	  manually adding and removing the control from the Controls
	  collecftion.
	* DataGridView.cs: Implement DataGridViewControlCollection. Add an
	  EditingControlInternal property that tracks the editing control.
	  Always keeping the scrollbars in the Controls collection, as MS
	  testing confirms is the right behaviour.

2007-07-23  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* ScrollableControl.cs: Fix implementation of AutoScrollPosition
	  according to MSDN and new test.

2007-07-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Implement ToolTipText.
	* TreeView.cs: Implement tooltips, NodeMouse* events.

2007-07-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Implement OnNodeMouseClick and OnNodeMouseDoubleClick.

2007-07-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Implement ContextMenu, ContextMenuStrip, and Level.
	* TreeView.cs: Use the node's contextmenu[strip] if applicable.

2007-07-20  Ivan N. Zlatev  <contact@i-nz.net>

	* Control.cs, Form.cs, ContainerControl.cs,
	ScrollableControl.cs, ButtonBase.cs:  Added ShouldSerialize
	for misc properties.

2007-07-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Implement StateImageIndex and StateImageKey.
	* TreeView.cs: Implement StateImageList.

2007-07-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs: Don't check if the current form is the active form before
	  activating it. Fixes #81904.

2007-07-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs: Don't check if the current form is the active form before
	  activating it. Fixes #81904.

2007-07-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* TreeView.cs: Apply patch from Tyron (tmm@aon.at). Fixes #81847.

2007-07-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs: Don't try to position the form after loading if the form was
	  disposed. Fixes #81969.

2007-07-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* PropertyGrid.cs, PropertyGridView.cs: Implemented 2.0 methods and
	  properties. Had to change ToolBar into ToolStrip, which required a
	  few #ifs.

2007-07-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* PropertyGrid.cs: PropertyToolBar: Redraw the entire toolbar when it's
	  resized, fixes part of #79829 (vertical lines in toolbar).
	  PropertyGrid: Refactored Populate* to something that's easier to
	  follow at least for me, as well as splitting it up into several new
	  methods, required to update only subitems when something has
	  changed by a popup editor or listbox. Don't use events to check
	  when any values are changed, since the events are unreliable (we're
	  changing the objects the events are registered with, and if the
	  event handling requires the objects to be immutable (objects stored
	  in hashtables for instance), the events will never be raised).
	* PropertyGridView.cs: Call PropertyGrid.PropertyValueChangedInternal
	  everytime we change a value, since events are unreliable.
	  DropDownButtonClicked: For the same reason don't compare objects to
	  check if it has changed or not, it would require all objects to
	  derive Equals. Fix dialog location on windows, MS is doing weird
	  things when creating parented forms.
	* GridEntry.cs: Add a SelectedObject setter.

2007-07-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Add some corcompare attributes.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Implement 2.0 stuffs.
	* TreeView.cs: Implement some 2.0 stuffs.

2007-07-18  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* WebBrowser.cs, WebBrowserBase.cs: add some more MonoTODOs now
	for moma.

2007-07-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Implement custom tab offsets.

2007-07-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripContentPanel.cs: Support System renderer.
	* ToolStripControlHost.cs: Set RightToLeft to default to No.

2007-07-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ScrollableControl.cs: Don't mess up the user's explicit bounds.

2007-07-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* CheckBox.cs: Chain TextAlign to base implementation instead of
	maintaining another one.

2007-07-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ButtonBase.cs: Fix an incorrect string constant.

2007-07-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextRenderer.cs: Use the static Graphics context in Hwnd instead
	of creating one for measuring strings.

2007-07-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs, ToolStripDropDown.cs, ToolStripDropDownMenu.cs: 
	Implement MaxItemSize.

2007-07-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Remove per-control 1x1 Bitmap and Graphics context used
	for DeviceContext.  Instead, use the static one available in Hwnd.
	Informal tests show this saves about 500k on formtest.exe.

2007-07-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs: Implement 2.0 AutoScaling.

2007-07-17  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* ComboBox.cs: Work around bug #82120 (bug in mcs).

2007-07-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Allow a Flat button to be Focused and Entered.
	Darken the focus color.

2007-07-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ListBox.cs: When measuring items, if it's a CheckedListBox, add room
	for the checkbox.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Make the checkbox bigger in a CheckedListBox and use
	X, Y instead of a rect for drawing text.
	- For ControlPaint.DrawCheckBox, center the check a little better when the
	checkbox is odd width.  When drawing a flat checkbox, use a white background
	when state != inactive.
	[Fixes bugs #82097, 82100]

2007-07-16  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ListControl.cs: When changing CurrencyManager, disconnect event
	handlers from previous one. Fixes bug #81771. Code formatting.

2007-07-15  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* PrintPreviewControl.cs: Remove extraneous Invalidate calls. Separate
	full preview invalidation from layout invalidation, and only invalidate
	the layout when setting zoom or other properties. Invalidation should
	always be done even when resetting properties with the same values as
	what is there. Fixes #81744 and #79830.

2007-07-15  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Implement initial support for Groups. Split some of the
	LayoutIcons code to render a partial list of the items (needed by
	items contained in ListViewGroup instances). Let the
	ListViewItemsCollection.ListView property be modifiable (needed when
	using Groups, too).
	* ListViewGroup.cs: Use a Bounds property rather than a Location
	one. Also invalidate the bounds when they get changed.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: When drawing items, also draw the group header
	if ListView.Groups.Count is bigger than 0. Add a DrawListViewGroupHeader
	method as well.

2007-07-15  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When space gets pressed and CheckBoxes is true, 
	don't invoke the Begin and EndUpdate methods. We are generating 
	a redraw of the entire control without need to do so.

2007-07-13  William Holmes <billholmes54@gmail.com> 

	* Control.cs: Changing logic in FindFlatForward and 
	  FindFlatBackward to handle multiple Controls with 
	  the same TabIndex.  
	  This fixes bug 81687.

2007-07-13  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* OSFeature.cs: Enable IsPresent.

2007-07-13  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: Don't do anything in WmShowWindow if the control has been
	  disposed. We can get WM_SHOWWINDOW after a control is disposed: a
	  control is created, put on a form, the control is disposed (the
	  form is never shown), and then we get a MapNotify, triggering a
	  WM_SHOWWINDOW.
	* Form.cs: Exclude the current form when sending Deactivate to all
	  MdiChildren.
	* NativeWindow.cs: Set WindowCreating to null as soon as possible,
	  there was a race condition because assigning the handle raises
	  events, we can get more messages, therefore trying to assign the
	  handle again, which would fail if any of those event handlers
	  closed/disposed the control.

2007-07-13  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs: Make the fix for #80775 windows-only (fixes #81957).

2007-07-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* SystemInformation.cs, Theme.cs, XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs,
	XplatUIWin32.cs: Implement SystemInformation 2.0 properties.

2007-07-12  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DateTimePicker.cs: If there's no part format specifier, return an
	  empty string.

2007-07-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* FlatButtonAppearance.cs: Throw NotSupportedException for a
	Transparent BorderColor.

2007-07-12  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com>

	  MessageBox.cs, ButtonBase.cs, PageSetupDialog.cs, NumericUpDown.cs,
	  X11Dnd.cs, Binding.cs, DataGrid.cs, AxHost.cs,
	  LinkLabelLinkClickedEventArgs.cs, TextRenderer.cs, Label.cs,
	  LinkLabel.cs, TreeNode.cs, BindingSource.cs, TabPage.cs,
	  TextBoxBase.cs, BindingNavigator.cs, Application.cs,
	  ToolStripPanel.cs, TabControl.cs, ThemeClearlooks.cs, TreeView.cs:
	  Remove warnings.
	* X11Structs.cs: Remove warnings, add ToString implementations.

2007-07-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Translate min/max size according to the actual min/max
	  size, and not the current size. Fixes #81798.

2007-07-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Fix #80822 again (DefWndProc can be reached before
	  XplatUI.CreateWindow returns, in which case the hwnd isn't assigned
	  to the control yet).

2007-07-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* PropertyGridTextBox.cs: Add a method that sends any forwarded
	  mousedowns to the contained textbox.
	* X11Structs.cs: More ToString implementation.
	* PropertyGridView.cs: Forward any mousedowns to the textbox, fixes
	  #81791.

2007-07-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* PropertyGridView.cs: Add a null-check, fixes a few tests.

2007-07-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TableLayoutPanelCellPosition.cs: TypeConverter.

2007-07-10  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	[ Fixes #79761]
	
	* PropertyGridTextBox.cs: Propagate any color changes to all contained
	  controls.
	* PropertyGridView.cs: A few color fixes.

2007-07-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Remove some old unused text formatting stuff.

2007-07-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Update full row select invalidation to match the
	newer DrawSelection... method.
	- Make sure to invalidate the entire width when selecting a new
	node, if we have full row selection enabled.

2007-07-10  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* PropertyGridView.cs: Fix for #81800, makes text show up on initial
	  display of properties again.

2007-07-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Add IntegerCollection and Add, Clear, Remove
	to existing collections.

2007-07-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* AccessibleObject.cs, RadioButton.cs: Fix some base classes
	that changed between 1.1 and 2.0.

2007-07-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* PowerStatus.cs: Added.  This is just a data class, it is filled
	in by SystemInformation.

2007-07-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Message.cs: Add op_Equality and op_Inequality.

2007-07-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

2007-07-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	the user set.  [Fixes bug #80466]

2007-07-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TableLayoutPanel.cs: Add a null check so we don't NRE trying to
	paint cell borders if we haven't calculated where they go yet.
	[Fixes bugs #82040 and #82041]

2007-07-07  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: In Details view, set the location of item_control
	in the (0,0) position (and the header_control is thus on the
	item_control). This way the Bounds of the Items are relative to the
	ListView control (before this, they had a Bounds value without the
	header_control offset, which wasn't matching .Net). Fixes #82004.

2007-07-07  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListControl.cs: When DataSource is set to null, pass an empty
	array of object to SetItemsCore. This is done to clean the items
	in the ListContol children. Fixes #81788.

2007-07-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ListControl.cs: Add 2.0 stuffs.

2007-07-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Label.cs: Finish up 2.0 stuffs.  Replace calls to Refresh with Invalidate,
	Refresh is overkill for just about every repaint request.

2007-07-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: TextDirection getter handles looking up Inherit for us,
	so remove my custom Get method and fix the property getter.

2007-07-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Label.cs: DefaultMargin for 2.0.

2007-07-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Override IsInputCharInternal and return true.  Fixes 
	reported issue where other controls with mnemonics would steal strokes
	from a selected ComboBox.

2007-07-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ScrollOrientation.cs: Make internal for 1.1.

	* ListView.cs: Implement the so-incredibly broken 2.0 
	VirtualItemsSelectionRangeChanged event.

2007-07-05  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When enter is pressed and selection is non empty,
	an OnItemActivate event must be fired.

2007-07-05  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Store the FocusedItem information as an
	int instead of a ListViewItem (needed by VirtualMode).
	Update the calls to SetFocusedItem to pass an index instead of
	an item.
	* ListViewItem.cs: Likewise. Also, in VirtualMode retrieve
	the Focused state from the owner ListView. 

2007-07-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Set ListView.focused_item from ListViewItem.Focused
	property. Also, invalidate previous focused item in the mentioned
	property (match .Net).

2007-07-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Implement 2.0 FocusedItem property setter.

2007-07-03  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Implement 2.0 TopItem property setter.

2007-07-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	if we are ManagerRenderMode.
	* ToolStripMenuItem.cs: Calculate our text color better.
	* ToolStripRenderer.cs, ToolStripProfessionalRenderer.cs: Move some stuff
	from Professional to the base class based off working with the System renderer.
	* ToolStripSystemRenderer.cs: Added.

2007-07-02  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

2007-06-25  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Implement 2.0 HitTest methods.

2007-06-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: Add a 2.0 bool Hot property, to tell whether the
	item is under the pointer or not (sugar). Also remove the TODO
	regarding to the cursor changes in OneClick activation.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: When HotTracking is true and we are drawing
	the subitems use the parent's HotFont if UseItemStyleForSubItems is
	true; otherwise don't show the underline style.

2007-06-22  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: In ItemControl.ItemsMouseMove, refactor
	the code to retrieve the item at position only one time. Also
	change cursor when Activation is ItemActivation.OneClick as well
	as invalidate the item if HotTracking is true (to show/hide the
	underline style). Add an internal HotItemIndex property to retrieve
	the current hot item's index.
	* ListViewItem.cs: Add an internal HotFont property to cache the
	font used when HotTracking is true and the pointer moves within the
	item's borders.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: When drawing the item's text, use Font or
	HotFont depending on the hot state of the item.

2007-06-22  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Implement 2.0 HotTracking property.

2007-06-21  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripControlHost.cs: If our hosted control never got created,
	don't try to dispose it.  [Fixes bug #81909]

2007-06-21  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TableLayoutPanel.cs: Implement ScaleCore, ScaleControl.

	Details view.
	* DrawListViewColumnHeaderEventArgs.cs:

	using the DrawText () methods.

2007-06-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	background which got erased in my changes yesterday.

2007-06-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	(2.0 feature).
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Refactor the drawing code for subitems, so we
	can invoke from the owner draw routines if we need it. Also, add
	support for Owner draw in Details view.

2007-06-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripDropDownMenu.cs, ToolStripItem.cs, ToolStripLabel.cs,

	the preview thumbnail. Change unit conversion to use 
	PrinterUnitConvert methods.

	recieved, we will exit the dnd tracking loop.

2007-05-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Keep tracking until the xdnd finished event is
	recieved. TODO: I should probably stick a timer on the dropped

2007-05-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

2007-05-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: If a control doesn't have a parent when it's Dock is

2007-05-24  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com>

	  loop, it will raise all the (Form)Closed/Closing events again if
	  WM_CLOSE has been sent earlier on, instead call RaiseCloseEvent,
	  which doesn'r raise any events it they have been raised before.

	* Control.cs: WmShowWindow: Update children's z-order after setting
	  their parent. SetParent may show the window, thereby corrupting
	  z-order, since the window will be shown on top.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: SetParent: don't call SetVisible on forms. Prevents
	  multiple (and redundant) WM_SHOWWINDOW messages.
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: RaiseDeactivate: only raise after an Activate
	  event has already been raised.
	* Form.cs: Change is_changing_visible_state to a counter, since
	  SetVisibleCore can be called recursively. CreateHandle: when
	  creating mdi children, send (De)Activated events.
	* MdiClient.cs: Update use of is_changing_visible_state.
	* Application.cs: OnThreadException: Surround exception handling with
	  try/finally to ensure we always reset the error-handling state
	  before leaving.

2007-05-22  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com>

	SmallIcon views, now that we have a standarized horizontal spacing.

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: ListViewHorizontalSpacing now has a value of
	4, just like the other views (Match .Net).

2007-05-21  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Delay calculating anchor distances until we actually layout.
	Always query the WM for the actual size and location it put us at instead of
	only when we send negative values.
	[Fixes bugs #81694, 81695]

2007-05-21  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* CreateParams.cs: Make HasWindowManager marginally faster.
	* XplatUIX11.cs, Hwnd.cs: CreateWindow: Move the default location code
	  into Hwnd so that other drivers can use it as well.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: CreateWindow: If the window has a window manager get
	  the default location from Hwnd. Fixes MDI client windows always
	  showing up at (0,0) in Windows (Win32 won't set the default
	  location since the window styles aren't correct).

2007-05-18  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

2007-05-18  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: According to MSDN controls created in the designer theres

2007-05-17  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Finish implementation of UI State using WmChangeUIState
	to send WM_UPDATEUISTATE to all child controls. Some hack will be needed

2007-05-17  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: When calculating the horizontal scrollbar

2007-05-17  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (CheckDataBindings): remove the binding_context arg
	to binding.Check.

	* CurrencyManager.cs (OnItemChanged): fix this now that
	BindingManagerBase is fixed. also remove the comment telling where
	the fix should go.  We set transfering_data to true/false around
	the call to PushData to keep UpdateIsBinding from being called.
	(ListChangedHandler): remove the extra OnMetaDataChanged call for
	PropertyDescriptorAdded in the 1.1 case.  The extra call is
	actually generated by System.Data generating 2 metadata changed
	events of its own per column add.  The fix should go there.  Add a
	comment to that affect in our test's Assert.Ignore.

	* BindingManagerBase.cs: Rework PullData and PushData slightly.
	we keep a boolean flag (transfering_data) that keeps us from
	calling UpdateIsBinding multiple times if we re-enter either of
	them.

	* ControlBindingsCollection.cs (AddCore): remove the
	binding_context arg to binding.Check.

	* Binding.cs (IsBinding): don't check if we're binding here, just
	return our cached value.  we update it in UpdateIsBinding.
	(Check): don't take the binding_context arg, we'll just use our
	control's.  Also, for some reason MS doesn't use the data member
	field when getting the bindingmanager for this binding.  it just
	uses the datasource.  Make this method callable multiple times,
	and only do the is_null_desc stuff if manager.Position != -1 (so
	we don't get an exception accessing manager.Current).
	(UpdateIsBinding): move the code from IsBinding here.
	(PositionChangedHandler): call Check here to we can initialize
	things that require a non- -1 position.

2007-05-17  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: When alt keys is pressed send WM_CHANGEUISTATE to top level

	* ToolTips.cs: Update Text if SetToolTip is called for a control
	already showing the tooltip, as well as restarting its timer; show
	tooltip if we are inside the control bounds by the time of calling
	SetToolTip. Inside ShowTooltip remove the check to not show the 
	tooltip again for the active control (it is allowed by .Net to 
	show the tooltip on the same control multiple times).

2007-05-16  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* MaskedTextBox.cs: Small fix for Text that fixes a broken test.

2007-05-16  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	tab processing, if it needs to. Fixes #81622
	* TabControl.cs: Fixes calculation for which tab to select on
	shift+ctrl+tab.

2007-05-16  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: On 1.0 profile, do not support multidotted 
	extensions.

2007-05-14  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Implement some of the new 2.0 methods.
	* RichTextBox.cs: We need to override these methods on 2.0.
	* MaskedTextBox.cs: These are implemented now
	* TextControl.cs: This was off by one.

2007-05-14  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Because the line endings are including in the
	text, we don't need to add them in anymore.

2007-05-11  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ToolBar.cs: Fix autosize and get it working only after hadle is created,
	also prevent redraw in set_autosize if handle is not created. Fixes #81523.

2007-05-11  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ToolBar.cs: Adjust size to default size when button theres no text and
	image, it fixes remaining issues from #81524.

2007-05-11  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ToolBar.cs: 
	- When not flat call redraw to recalculate sizes on creare handle to match
	win32 behavior.
	- Revert 77220 because it causes some regressions in toobar
	button.

2007-05-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com>

	  now actually enters a usable state.

2007-05-11  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	calculations, it reduces the size cauculation from 7 to 3 on a toolbar with
	3 buttons.

	* ThemeWinClassic.cs: For .Net 2.0 don't draw any image
	if we are using checkboxes, checked is true, and we have less
	than two images in StateImageList; for the 1.1 in the same scenario
	draw the first image if we have at least one image in StateImageList.
	Fixes part of #81191.

2007-05-10  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	take into account the double clicks even if we have only
	one image in StateImageList (only for 1.0/1.1). Also 
	generate an extra change of checked state when we receive
	the second click on checkbox (match .Net behaviour).

	[Fixes bug #81582]

2007-05-10  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* TableLayoutSettings.cs: A big doh! fix and bowing down of head in 
	shame. (I blame my ever-persisting and annoying cold)

2007-05-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ListView.cs: Don't eat navigation keys.  Let them flow through to
	KeyDown/KeyPress routines.  [Fixes bug #81569]

2007-05-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ListView.cs: When handling keys for selecting the item based off
	keyboard input, do not consider keys pressed with Alt or Control.  Also,
	correctly handle keys when the Shift key is down. [Fixes bug #81578]

2007-05-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: When using UseWaitCursor, we have to store the requested
	Cursor to use when UseWaitCursor is turned off.

2007-05-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Implement PreProcessControlMessage.  Default IsInputChar
	to false.
	* Application.cs: Use PreProcessControlMessage instead of
	PreProcessMessage.
	* PreProcessControlMessage.cs: Make internal for 1.1.

2007-05-08  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Control.cs: Add InternalContains focus property, which hast the same
	functionality of ContainsFocus, but also including implicit controls.
	* ListViewItem.cs: Use InternalContainsFocus instead of ContainsFocus,
	since we need to know if the focus is contained in our implicit
	ItemControl when calculating Layout. Fixes part of #80888.

2007-05-08  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ToolTip.cs: Remove center form string alignment as it must be align to

	- Disable DoubeBuffering
	
2007-05-08  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* ScrollableControl.cs: ScrollIControlntoView: we now only move the
	  control as much as necessary in order to make it entirely visible,
	  instead of centering the control in the container (matches MS
	  behaviour). CalculateCanvasSize: we need to take the current scroll
	  position into account when calculating the maximum canvas,
	  otherwise the following scenario will fail: resize so that the
	  scrollbars appear, use the scrollbars to scroll, resize again
	  smaller, and now the canvas size is too small. Recalculate: when
	  showing scrollbars make sure they start off at 0, and try to scroll
	  the active control into view. Fixes #79540. HandleScrollBar: don't
	  scroll anywhere if the scrollbar isn't visible.

2007-05-07  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: When focus changed, call Layout/Invalidate
	in the focused item to update the selected state (should show
	entire label when ListView is focused, and a part of it if is not).
	* ListViewItem.cs: When doing layout for LargeIcon, take into account
	for displaying the entire label not only the Focused state of the
	item, but also the Focused state of the ListView (match .Net
	behaviour).

2007-05-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Stub CanRaiseEvents, IsMirrored, and NotifyClients.
	Implement UseWaitCursor.

	[Fixes bug #81477]

2007-05-07  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Changed Win32CreateWindow to take enums instead of
	  uints.
	* Form.cs: CreateParams: don't set WS_VISIBLE if we're changing
	  visibility. We can't create forms visible, since we have to set the
	  owner before making the form visible (otherwise Win32 will do
	  strange things with task bar icons). The problem is that we set the
	  internal is_visible to true before creating the control, so
	  is_changing_visible_state is the only way of determining if we're
	  in the process of creating the form due to setting Visible=true -
	  this works because SetVisibleCore explicitly makes the form
	  visibile afterwards anyways. Fixes #80775.

2007-05-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: When drawing ListViewItems,
	use StringTrimming.EllipsisCharacter if the view is Tile, Details,
	or LargeIcon _and_ item is not focused (match .Net behaviour).

2007-05-04  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs, Form.cs: Fix some obsolete method warnings.

2007-05-04  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs: Fix active_control attribution when going
	up the parent chain so that the first parent container gets the control
	and the rest of the parent containers get the child containers (skips
	non-containers). Fixes #80729

2007-05-04  Randolph Chung  <tausq@debian.org>

	  minimized forms. Fixes #81518,

	* Form.cs: Add OnDeactivateInternal.

	  accessing the parent. Fixes #81508.

2007-05-03  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* CurrencyManager.cs (CurrencyManager.ListChangeHandler): in the
	2.0 block, pass listposition + 1 to ChangeRecordState when a row
	was added before the current listposition.  Fixes the
	TestInsertRowBeforeCurrent unit test.

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Better preferred height, FixedSingle gets the
	wider area too.
	- Don't set the BoundsSpecified

2007-04-30  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	message to pass through to a regular control if it hosted by a toolstrip.
	* ToolStrip.cs, ToolStripControlHost.cs, ToolStripDropDown.cs,

	the MDI menu item.  [Fixes bug #81483]

2007-04-30  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* DataGridViewColumn.cs: Initialize value of headercell to zero-length
	string. When setting Name to null, use zero-length string instead.

2007-04-29  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Implement missing 2.0 methods (SelectTab, 
	DeselectTab). Implement missing 2.0 TabPageCollection methods
	(Add, ContainsKey, RemoveByKey, IndexOfKey)

2007-04-29  Pedro Martínez Juliá  <pedromj@gmail.com>

2007-04-28  Alan McGovern <alan.mcgovern@gmail.com>

	* DrawListViewSubItemEventArgs.cs: Added missing setter

2007-04-27  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* ToolTip.cs: Add missing 2.0 properties. Implement 2.0 Show and 
	Hide methods (not complete). Implement missing 2.0 OnPopup event.

2007-04-27  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: In ItemControl.OnMouseDown restore a pair of braces I
	removed in ly last commit (it was breaking the Label edit feature).

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: When drawing a ListViewItem use
	StringAlignment.Near for LineAlignment (match .Net).

2007-04-27  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Change SetTab so it adds the tabpage to the list
	of controls if it isn't already there - was blowing up when doing
	tabcontrol.TabPages[i]=new TabPage(). 
	SetTab now does a replace by removing the page at the index. 
	Add a new InsertTab method that inserts a page in a given index 
	instead of replacing. 
	Implements TabPageCollection.Insert(int, TabPage).

2007-04-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* BindingManagerBase.cs: fill in CurrentItemChanged (and have an
	internal handler that can be invoked from our subclasses.)  Also,
	add a comment to PushData about how we need to fix it.

	* CurrencyManager.cs: tons of changes here.  trying to get things
	matching the behavior of .net wrt event orders (ItemChanged,
	CurrentChanged, PositionChanged.)  I've implemented a private .net
	symbol (ChangeRecordState) that appears in stack traces because
	it's actually easier to do this than to effective inline all its
	various behaviors at every call site.

	* RelatedPropertyManager.cs: guard against an exception here by
	not using parent.Current if the position is set to -1 (if the
	parent datasource is cleared, for instance).

	* Binding.cs: don't parse data in PushData (this might be wrong,
	but it jives with MS's behavior.)  Also, don't call PushData when
	we get a CurrentChanged event.

2007-04-27  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* WebBrowser.cs,
	  WebBrowserBase.cs,
	  WebBrowserSiteBase.cs,
	  HtmlDocument.cs: Added stubbed out classes, no real implementations 
	  yet.

2007-04-27  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MainMenu.cs: In draw method without parameters call draw method with 
	PaintEvent, another one (just rect) adjust rectangle and we dont need it
	as Rect property is already adjusted. Fixes #80694.

2007-04-27  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Application.cs: Need to handle keyboard menu deselection here.
	* Control.cs: Use WM_SYSKEYUP instead of WM_SYSCOMMAND to start menu keyboard
	navigation, allowing keyboard to work on X11.
	* ToolStrip.cs: Don't worry about handling the Menu key here anymore.

2007-04-27  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs: When deactivate menu verify if hotkey (_) is active and redraw
	menu bar. It fixes some drawing issues in menu bar.

2007-04-27  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Remove unneeded "keynav_state = KeyNavState.Idle" before 
	Deactivate calls, Deactivate method already do it. Also ser ActiveTracker
	when <alt> key is pressed.

2007-04-26  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Simplify SystrayRemove to be like other libraries,	Gtk as 
	example just set visible to false and make this prevent from other problems.
	In SystrayAdd always remove pending expose. Fixes #81072.

2007-04-26  Marek Safar  <marek.safar@gmail.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs (CaretMoved): Consider scroll maximum when scroll
	value is set.

2007-04-26  Alan McGovern <alan.mcgovern@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Added three missing 2.0 events and corresponding
	EventHandlers. Added the OwnerDraw property.

2007-04-26  Alan McGovern <alan.mcgovern@gmail.com>

	* DrawListViewItemEventArgs.cs
	* DrawListViewSubItemEventArgs.cs: Brought classes up to 2.0 status.

2007-04-26  Alan McGovern <alan.mcgovern@gmail.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Fixed typo in constructor

2007-04-26  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Application.cs: Create a shortcut path so that currently selected
	MenuStrips can intercept keyboard events without having focus.
	* Control.cs: Handle WM_SYSCOMMAND message to activate MenuStrips.
	* MenuStrip.cs, ToolStrip.cs, ToolStripDropDown.cs, ToolStripDropDownItem.cs,
	ToolStripItem.cs, ToolStripManager.cs, ToolStripMenuItem.cs: Support
	keyboard navigation (arrows, tab, enter, esc) on Windows.  Still need to
	generate WM_SYSCOMMAND message in X11 for other platforms.
	* ToolStripProfessionalRenderer.cs: ToolStripMenuItems need to be painted
	in OnRenderMenuItemBackground instead of OnRenderButtonBackground.
	* ToolStripSplitButton.cs: Add DefaultItem property.
	
2007-04-26  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MainMenu.cs: In OnMenuChanged pass PaintEventArgs to Draw method, it
	fixes some menu draw problem on Windows with border diferent from default
	it also fixes #81403.

2007-04-26  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs: Refactor WndProc into separate methods, just like Control is
	  doing it.

2007-04-26  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: set_Text: move the call to the driver into a seperate
	  virtual method so that Form can override it.
	* MaskedTextBox.cs: Corcompare fixes.
	* Form.cs: Override UpdateWindowText and only update the styles if the
	  form has been shown (fixes #81405).

2007-04-25  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs, Form.cs: Use the better supported WM_?BUTTONDOWN and
	WM_ACTIVATE messages instead of WM_MOUSEACTIVATE and
	WM_ACTIVATEAPP.  This fixes menus not disappearing on X11 when
	the form lost focus or another control was clicked.

2007-04-25  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* DataGrid.cs: Uncomment MakeTransparent calls since bug #80151 is
	fixed.

2007-04-25  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DrawListViewColumnHeaderEventHandler.cs, DrawToolTipEventArgs.cs,
	  DrawListViewItemEventHandler.cs,
	  DrawListViewSubItemEventHandler.cs, DrawToolTipEventHandler.cs:
	  Added.
	* X11Structs.cs: More ToString implementation.

2007-04-25  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripDropDownItem.cs: Don't lazy create a DropDown in Dispose.
	* ToolStripOverflowButton.cs: Don't lazy create a DropDown in HasDropDownItems.

2007-04-25  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: Only raise OnVisibleChanged if we're not recreating the
	  handle.
	* FormCollection.cs: Don't add a form if it's already in the
	  collection.
	* Form.cs: Change ShowDialog () to call ShowDialog (owner) with a null
	  according to behaviour and MSDN. The ownerWin32 is the active
	  window at the moment when we call ShowDialog, not the context's
	  main form (the context's main form may open another form that opens
	  a form with ShowDialog, the win32 owner is the second form). Add
	  and remove forms to the Application.OpenForms in other places to
	  better match MS behaviour. Add an IsActive property that raises
	  On(de)Activated only if the active state has changed (we were
	  raising OnDeactivated before OnActivated while creating forms).
	* Application.cs: Refactor Enabling/Disabling of windows for modal
	  dialog loops out to separate methods, and restore the thread
	  context when we quit the method. Fixes #81407.

2007-04-25  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: In ItemControl.HandleClicks, also fire 
	2.0 MouseClick or MouseDoubleClick events on the parent,
	not only the Click/DoubleClick events.

2007-04-24  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* TableLayoutSettings.cs: 
	- Added a GetControls method and a support structure to help the 
	TypeConverter to enumerate the controls for	serialization. 
	- Added a new serialization constructor. 
	- Added a isSerialized flag initialized to true on the 
	serialization constructor so that the TableLayoutPanel.LayoutSettings 
	setter does not throw the designed NotSupportedOperation exception
	when the object is built through deserialization.
	- Implemented GetObjectData
	
	* TableLayoutPanel.cs: Added check on LayoutSettings.

2007-04-24  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Report Click and DoubleClick events to the parent
	from ItemsMouseUp, instead of ItemsMouseDown. This prevents us
	from breaking the click count state when using dialog forms (Control
	reports the clicks in a similar fashion). In the previous behaviour
	the last WM_LBUTTONUP message in a  double click was sent to the
	ListView's form, instead of the ListView, which was breaking the click
	count for it. Fixes #80387.

2007-04-24  Alan McGovern <alan.mcgovern@gmail.com>

	* BindingNavigator.cs : fixed bugs revealed by new nunit tests

2007-04-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripDropDownItem.cs: Lazy initialize the DropDown.  This prevents
	us from created dropdowns for menu items that do not have subitems.
	* ToolStripItem.cs, ToolStripProfessionalRenderer.cs, ToolStripSplitButton.cs:
	Check HasDropDownItems before calling DropDown so a dropdown will not be
	created if it isn't needed.

2007-04-24  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Set the first node to the selected node when we get
	focus if there is no selected node.

2007-04-24  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: remove using blocks so that image streams are
	not disposed of. Fixes #80151

2007-04-24  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Fixup the height of textboxes when the control
	is created.

2007-04-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Fully implement GetNextItem.  Call OnParentRightToLeftChanged
	for each ToolStripItem when the parent's RightToLeftChanged is called.

2007-04-24  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* ComboBox.cs: Forward ContextMenu to the underlying textbox, if any.
	  Fixes #80163.
	* Control.cs: Replace GetContextMenuInternal() with ContextMenuInternal
	  property, so that the setter can be overriden too.
	* TextBox.cs: Change GetContextMenuInternal() to use
	  ContextMenuInternal.

2007-04-24  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Use a black pen to draw checkboxes, fixes
	  #81406.

2007-04-24  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Use a black pen to draw checkboxes, fixes
	  #81406.

2007-04-24  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* MaskedTextBox.cs: Commit this so nobody else starts working on it and
	  avoid duplicate work. Mostily skeleton code, it's not working at
	  all yet.

2007-04-20  Leszek Ciesielski <skolima@gmail.com>

	* NotifyIcon.cs : stub for MouseClick event
	* Application.cs: stub for SetUnhandledExceptionMode

2007-04-24  Alan McGovern <alan.mcgovern@gmail.com>

	* BindingNavigator.cs : Initial (partial) implementation

2007-04-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Do not create the treeview's handle when setting
	the scroll position.
	- ExpandAll needs to compute the scrollbars so it knows which
	position to set the bar too.
	* TreeNode.cs: 
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Pass new flag to UpdateScrollBars

2007-04-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Non multiline textboxes shouldn't take the enter
	key. Fixes #81408.

2007-04-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: Make GetImageSize internal.
	* ToolStripMenuItem.cs: Use GetImageSize to determine the size we
	need to draw an item.  Fixes a reported issue where images on menus
	that were not 16x16 were drawing incorrectly.

2007-04-21  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Padding.cs: Use the converter, fixes the resgen2 issue with
	XMLNotePad. 

2007-04-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Dont try to unhighlight the selected node if there
	isn't a selected node.

2007-04-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* UpDownBase.cs:
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	* ListView.cs:
	* ListBox.cs:
	* TreeView.cs: Use the InternalBorderStyle property to set the
	initial border style, this forces the client rectangle to be sized
	correctly.

2007-04-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Simplify scrolling to the last node after expanding
	all.
	- Fix some off by ones with setting the bottom.

2007-04-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Use DefaultSize for Size, calculate ClientSize from
	that.  We were incorrectly doing it the other way around.  Also,
	update ClientSize if we change the BorderStyle before the control
	is created.

2007-04-20  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* XplatUI.cs: Added Border3DSize, BorderSize, CaptionButtonSize,
	DoubleClickSize, DoubleClickTime and FixedFrameBorderSize. Renamed
	XplatUIDriver.Caption to CaptionHeight. Spaces to tabs.
	* XplatUIDriver.cs: Added Border3DSize, BorderSize, CaptionButtonSize,
	DoubleClickSize, DoubleClickTime and FixedFrameBorderSize. Renamed
	Caption to CaptionHeight.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Renamed Caption to CaptionHeight.
	* Theme.cs: Modified Border3DSize, BorderSize, CaptionButtonSize
	and FixedFrameBorderSize to return value from current XplatUI driver.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Implemented Border3DSize, BorderSize,
	CaptionButtonSize, DragFullWindows, DoubleClickSize, DoubleClickTime
	and FixedFrameBorderSize using win32 API. Renamed Caption to
	CaptionHeight.
	* XplatUIOSX.cs: Renamed Caption to CaptionHeight.
	* SystemInformation.cs: Fixed typo in BorderSize.

2007-04-20  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* XplatUI.cs: Added MenuAccessKeysUnderlined.
	* XplatUIDriver.cs: Added MenuAccessKeysUnderlined.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Implemented MenuAccessKeysUnderlined by always
	returning false.
	* Theme.cs: Modified MenuAccessKeysUnderlined to return corresponding
	value from XplatUI driver.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Implemented MenuAccessKeysUnderlined using
	SystemParametersInfo.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Remove obsolete MenuAccessKeysUnderlined
	override.
	* XplatUIOSX.cs: Implemented MenuAccessKeysUnderlind by always
	returning false.

2007-04-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs, Hwnd.cs: Remove warnings.

2007-04-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* MessageBox.cs, XplatUIX11.cs, Hwnd.cs: Remove warnings.

2007-04-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripManager.cs: Fix a reported InvalidCastException when unmerging
	MenuStrips that contain ToolStripSeparators.

2007-04-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs: Add
	  DefineStdCursorBitmap.
	* Cursor.cs: Add an internal constructor so that the Cursor knows if it
	  has been created off a standard cursor. This is used to get a
	  bitmap of the standard cursor when Draw or DrawStretched is called
	  in order to draw the cursor.
	* X11Structs.cs: Added XcursorImage and XcursorImages.
	* XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs: Add and implement
	  DefineStdCursorBitmap.
	* Cursors.cs: Update all relevant creations of Cursor to use the new
	  internal constructor.

2007-04-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBox.cs: Move the has_been_focused into the base control, so
	some of the text adding methods can manipulate it (probably time
	for a better name for this flag too).
	- Call a new version of selectall that doesn't scroll
	* TextBoxBase.cs: When we append text, if the document is empty,
	don't scroll.  If the document has text already, we scroll to the
	end of the appended text.
	- When the text is changed, we reset the has_been_focused, so the
	next time the control gets focused, all the text is selected.

2007-04-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Move the margins to the document, add a method
	so the margin sizes can be updated.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: When the border style is changed, update the
	border sizes.

2007-04-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Respect DefaultPadding.
	* GroupBox.cs: Implement DefaultPadding, DisplayRectangle takes
	padding into account.
	* ToolStrip.cs: Remove setting padding to DefaultPadding in constructor.	

2007-04-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Oops, we need to use the ClientRect not the
	bounds here.

2007-04-18  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: In ItemControl.ItemsMouseDown, take into
	account the double clicks when CheckBoxes are used and
	the pointer is inside the checkbox. Fixes part of #81191.

2007-04-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Pressing the end key shouldn't move the caret
	past the line ending.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: We can still delete if we are in the line
	ending and the combine will just kill the existing line ending.

2007-04-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: We can't move lines, then invalidate their
	bounds, we need to get the old bounds and combine that with the
	new bounds.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Before combining two lines for a delete, we need
	to invalidate the area of the old line, since that will be moved
	in the combine operation.

2007-04-18  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* LinkLabel.cs: In OnPaint invoke draw background to fix problems
	with transparent background. Fixes #80482.

2007-04-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* PictureBox.cs: Refresh on resize when SizeMode = Zoom.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Implement PictureBox.SizeMode = Zoom.
	[Fixes bug #81391]

2007-04-18  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* CreateParams.cs: Add a couple of helper methods and do a less string
	  concatenation in ToString.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Add an TranslateClientRectangleToXClientRectangle
	  overload that takes a Control parameter, since this method may be
	  called before a control is assigned to the hwnd (from
	  CreateWindow), and update CreateWindow to use the new overload. In
	  GetMenuOrigin subtract the title bar from the y position if the
	  form has a window manager (since we're painting it and not X).
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: If we can get a form in GetMenuOrigin use the form's
	  CreateParams to calculate the origin (since border sizes may vary).
	  In ScreenToMenu only subtract the title height if we actually have
	  a title.
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Override MenuHeight to always return 0, since
	  mdi children never have menus of themselves.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Implement menu handling like form does.
	  Added GetMenuOrigin to calculate the menu origin, can't use the
	  CreateParams from the form like normally since it's lying.
	* Hwnd.cs: Implement GetBorderSize better (in the sense more
	  windows-like) and add Inflate and comparison operators to the
	  Borders type. When calculating MenuOrigin and it's a form with a
	  window manager, use the window manager to calculate it.

2007-04-17  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (CreateControl): turns out in 2.0 we don't need this
	OnBindingContextChanged thing here.  It's only generated from
	ContainerControl.OnCreateControl.  Fixes a newly written unit test
	- BindingTest.BindingContextChangedTest4.
	
2007-04-17  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs: When setting values, make sure the current
	position stays within the new values range.

2007-04-17  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (CreateControl): talk about a bizarre corner case.
	Don't emit OnBindingContextChanged here if we're a parentless
	control (i.e. if we're a form.).  Fixes
	BindingTest.BindingContextChangedTest2.

2007-04-17  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ButtonBase.cs: Remove TextFormatFlags.WordBreak to mimic same behavior 
	from win32. Fixes #81255.

2007-04-17  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Remove text offset from DrawButtonText as it is
	already present in CalculateButtonTextAndImageLayout.

2007-04-17  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: When setting min/max size for a window we need to
	  translate the coordinates to x coordinates. Create an overload of
	  SetWindowMinMax that takes a CreateParams handling this, and change
	  SetWMStyles to call this function (can't use Control.FromHandle in
	  the SetWindowMinMax to get the control/CreateParams from the handle
	  because the handle might not have been assigned to the control
	  yet). Fixes #81371.

2007-04-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: In ItemControl.ItemMouseDown, don't change check state
	if StateImageList is non-null and it has less than two items (match MS
	behaviour). Also, in HandleNavKeys handle the Space key, calling
	the new ToggleItemsCheckState method, which tries to change the
	checked state of the selected items. Fixes part of #81191.

2007-04-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: namespace cleanup.

2007-04-16  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Back last parameter to true in SetClipRegion.

2007-04-16  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	[Fixes #79447]
	* Control.cs: Call invalidate in set_Region.

	* XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs: Remove invalidate from SetClipRegion as
	it dont	works here.

2007-04-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: When enter is pressed, we need to update all
	lines below the current.

2007-04-16  Jonathan Pobst  <jpobst@monkey.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Implement implicit menu merging for MDI
	children.  When a child form is active, if it has a menustrip
	and the parent form has a MainMenuStrip, automatically merge
	the menus.

2007-04-15  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Refactored sizing methods to not repeat
	code all over the place. Tab bounds are now calculated
	as if alignment is top and single line, and only when 
	setting the bounds are the positions adjusted according
	to alignment. Replaced hardcoded positions, spacings and
	paddings by getting the values the ThemeEngine. 
	Fixes #79619.
	
	* Theme.cs: Change TabControl properties and methods so
	that all start with TabControl*. Added more properties
	to help remove hardcoded values on tabcontrol.
	Add CPDrawBorder3D declaration so the Theming classes
	can access it.
	
	* ThemeClearlooks.cs, ThemeNice.cs: Method signature changes from Theme.

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Rector TabControl out to the TabControlPainter
	on the Theming namespace, and call the appropriate methods here.
	Change CPDrawBorder3D to public.

2007-04-13  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Control.cs: In WmRButtonUp, send the WM_CONTEXTMENU message to
	the control after firing the OnMouseUp event, instead of sending
	the message before the mentioned event. This is so we can match the
	MS behaviour. Fixes part of #80385.

2007-04-13  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: Call the RightToLeftChanged event when setting the
	RightToLeft property.

2007-04-13  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Add properties and internal methods to support merging.
	* ToolStripItem.cs: Add MergeAction and MergeIndex.
	* ToolStripItemCollection.cs: Add Insert and Remove methods that do
	not trigger reparenting or layouts.
	* ToolStripManager.cs: Add Merge and RevertMerge methods.
	* ToolStripOverflow.cs: Add a convenience method to find the ToolStrip that
	is hosting the overflow menu.

2007-04-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Set the line ending correctly for the first
	inserted line.

2007-04-13  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Theme.cs: Update GetMethod to get the new definition for 
	KnownColors.Update (and fix theme color updates).

2007-04-12  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MessageBox.cs: Fix some test and button position.

2007-04-12  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Form.cs: Consider the implicit controls in
	GetRealChildAtPoint. We need it since this method
	is called on Form when handling the some messages in
	WndProc, and need to consider those implicit ones too.
	Fixes #80385.

2007-04-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripMenuItem.cs: Display the ShortcutKeyDisplayString even
	if there are no ShortcutKeys set.
	* ToolStripProfessionalRenderer.cs: If an item has had its BackColor
	set, use it when painting.

2007-04-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Fix some off-by-one issues in line duplication
	and insertion in the undo manager. Also, overwrite the first tag
	of a line on insert, if it is just a zero lengthed tag. This
	prevents us from getting an extra stranded tag at the beginning of
	the first line.

2007-04-11  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Label.cs: Remove check for handle created in CalcAutoSize, we need 
	to calculated proper size including when handle was not created yet.

2007-04-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* MdiWindowManager.cs: When moving a form, allow the form to be moved
	  when the mouse is outside of it's parent's client rectangle. Fixes
	  #79982 (take 3, part 2).

2007-04-10  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* X11Structs.cs: Add a few ToString() overrides.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Added GetTopLevelWindowLocation to try to calculate
	  the window location in a window-manager independent way. Reworked
	  FrameExtents, it now actually works. Reworked AddConfigureNotify
	  and ReparentNotify handling to use GetTopLevelWindowLocation
	  instead of the earlier, more hacky solution. Reworked SetWMStyles,
	  hopefully for the better: we now set _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE* for all
	  windows, DIALOG for modal windows, UTILITY for toolboxes and NORMAL
	  for all other windows (fixes #81281 part 1), a toolwindow is hidden
	  from the taskbar if it has a parent (fixes #81281 part 2 for kwin),
	  and generally refactored to do as few calculations as possible
	  inside the lock.

2007-04-09  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Theme.cs: Change "reflective-contract" between MWF and SD to 
	minimize # of calls, avoid Color serialization and avoid updating 
	every "known colors" each time a single one is updated.

2007-04-09  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs: Only set IsInEditOrNavigateMode to false
	when not readonly and the text is explicitly set. Code style updates.
	* DataGridTableStyle.cs: Removed extra line.
	* DataGrid.cs: Code style updates. Removed extra whitespace.
	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs: Code style updates. Removed extra 
	whitespace.

2007-04-09  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Added comment that "fixes" #80021.

2007-04-09  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: We don't need this -1 on the line count anymore.

2007-04-09  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs: In Commit, use TypeConverter to convert
	entered value to underlying type, and convert it back to a string to
	apply formatting. Modified GetFormattedValue to use TypeConverter
	if available.

2007-04-08  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ListViewItem.cs: Added null checks. Avoid duplicating code in ctors.
	Use SubItems property when we want to ensure there's at least one
	subitem. Modified SubItems property to ensure there's always at least
	one subitem. Avoid using ListViewSubItemCollection.AddRange to match
	the NRE's reported by MS.

2007-04-07  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ProgressBar.cs: On 2.0 profile, default forecolor is Highlight. Added
	ResetForeColor override on 2.0. Fixed a few API compatibility issues.
	Spaces to tabs. Removed extra tabs.

2007-04-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripSplitStackLayout.cs: If we run out of things to hide, don't
	infinite loop.  (Forgot to copy to the horizontal toolstrip case.)

2007-04-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: When a delete removes a line, recalculate all
	lines below that line (they need to get offsets setup correctly)
	and invalidate.

2007-04-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: We need to invalidate across the width of the
	document when we are invalidating multiple lines.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Don't delete into the line ending.

2007-04-05  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Restore the check for the MouseHover event
	in ListView. It looks like the ListView fires more than one MouseHover
	event when HoverSelection is true  _only_ in weird-corner scenarios, but
	in most of the cases it only fires one. Also, add the 2.0 ItemMouseHover
	event.

2007-04-05  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs : raise MouseDown before updating selection.
	[Fixes #80373 tab 1&3]

2007-04-05  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripRenderer.cs: Add static method to mirror image.
	* ToolStripProfessionalRenderer.cs: Support ImageTransparentColor
	and RightToLeftAutoMirrorImage.
	* ToolStripItem.cs: Remove MonoTODO from ImageTransparentColor.

2007-04-05  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripSplitStackLayout.cs: Support Alignment property.
	* ToolStripItem.cs: Remove MonoTODO from the Alignment property.

2007-04-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Move around the line endings when crossing line
	boundaries.
	- When combining lines, strip the ending text off the first line.

2007-04-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs:
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Try to never move the cursor into the line
	ending.
	
2007-04-04  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: Make sure we aren't firing mouse events when
	the item is disabled.  Also add a few missing methods.

2007-04-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: We don't need the MouseEnter/MouseLeave check
	to fire just one MouseHover event when HoverSelection is true, since
	.Net does fire more than one MouseHover event in that scenario. Also,
	fix the selection in HoverSelection, by invoking UpdateMultiSelect
	if MultiSelect is true, instead of only setting ListViewItem.Selected.
	Finally, we need to reset the Hover logic in MouseMove, even when we
	don't have a selected item.

2007-04-04  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Add several missing methods, properties, and events.

2007-04-04  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs: set the bounds of the text box to
	(0,0,0,0) in Commit, as MS does.

	* DataGrid.cs: call EndEdit() from Select() as microsoft does, and
	make sure we set CurrentRow on a row header click *before* calling
	Select.  This moves the current cell (and the textbox) to the new
	row.  The call to Select then hides the textbox, giving us the
	correct behavior.  Fixes #80362.

	* CurrencyManager.cs (UpdateIsBinding): raise ItemChanged (-1).
	(ListChangedHandler): reorder the position/current changed events,
	and call UpdateIsBinding in the ItemAdded case.

	* GridColumnStylesCollection.cs: add some columns events, one of
	which raises the CollectionChanged event.

2007-04-04  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: When we delete multiple selection lines
	invalidate the selection area, don't need to do that for single
	lines because the final update view will handle it.

2007-04-04  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: When we CreateControl, we need to also create all of the
	control's children.  The child's OnLoad must also fire before the parent's
	OnLoad.  Fixes the toolbox size in PDN.

2007-04-04  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: When the user presses enter, insert a line
	ending into the text. (Maybe this would be a good spot for
	Environment.NewLine).
	* TextControl.cs: Remove undo manager hack, line endings get
	inserted properly now.
	
2007-04-04  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs: 
	- Remove unneeded parameters in UpdateCursor.
	- Fix UpdateCursor to check if menu is active.
	- Call UpdateCursor when menu deactivate my click.
	[Fixes remaining issues from #80410]

2007-04-04  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Control.cs: GetRealChildAtPoint method added, it make an
	recursive child control search for the point. 

	* Form.cs: Makes use of GetRealChildAtPoint in mouse event after closes
	menu.

	* MenuAPI.cs: Makes use of GetRealChildAtPoint in UpdateCursor.

2007-04-03  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Form.cs: Fix mouse position when send back mouse event after closes
	menu.

2007-04-03  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Form.cs: Simplify the BUTTONDOWN for active tracker.

2007-04-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Fix an issue where if a user resized a control inside
	a sizing method like OnResize, we would overwrite their explicit
	value.  Also, only call DefaultSize once in the constructor instead
	of 4 times.  Also, do not call SetBoundsCore from SetBounds if 
	nothing actually changed.

2007-04-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Don't attempt to copy text for lines with no
	text in them (technically this shouldn't happen, but we aren't
	always inserting line endings when we should be).

2007-04-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Calculate the scrollbars before calculating the
	document, because this sets some of the document size properties
	that are needed.

2007-04-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: We need to calculate maximums even if this is
	not a multiline control, because the maxs are used for scrolling.
	- Display the caret after doing a page up/down, we need to
	manually display it because a proper CaretMoved event isn't
	triggered (this is because of the way the math is done to
	determine how far to scroll).

2007-04-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolBar.cs: Fix some breakage caused by the SetBoundsCore change.
	(ToolBar was relying on SetBoundsCore to default the values sent 
	base off of BoundsSpecified.)

2007-04-03  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DateTimePicker.cs: Change Text so that when a null value or empty
	  string is assigned to the test we always raise ValueChanged and
	  TextChanged (earlier implementation would only raise ValueChanged
	  if the current date value was different from DateTime.Now).

2007-04-03  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com> 

	* ButtonBase: Call update after invalidation, fixes #80194

2007-04-03  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Draw StatusBar using double buffering. Fixes
	  #79335.

2007-04-03  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: SetWMStyles: If the control is a form with
	  FormBorderStyle = None, don't give the window any decorations.
	  Fixes #81276.

2007-04-03  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs: Updated CalculateWindowRect parameters.
	* CreateParams.cs: Fix IsSet, wasn't working correctly when the style
	  to check for is a mix of several styles (such as WS_CAPTION for
	  instance).
	* Control.cs: Don't paint an area bigger than the client area when
	  painting the background colour. Add an internal GetCreateParams.
	  Update calls to XplatUI.CalculateWindowRect due to API change.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: In PerformNCCalc set the initial size to the whole
	  window's size, and handle WM_NCCALCSIZE in DefWndProc to calculate
	  the size if it hasn't been handled by any windows. When creating
	  and moving windows, X wants the location of the entire window, but
	  the size of the client window, so add
	  TranslateClientRectangleToXClientRectangle,
	  TranslateWindowSizeToXWindowSIze and
	  TranslatedXWindowSizeToWindowSize to cope with this, and call them
	  before every window creation and move. Update CalculateWIndowRect
	  to use Hwnd.GetWindowRect (one step towards removing DeriveStyles).
	  In AddConfigureNotify don't do anything if the hwnd is a zombie
	  (fixes the BadWindow we were getting while running the tests),
	  always calculate the offsets when it's a parentless window, not
	  only when reparented, and translate the window size, since we're
	  getting the client size of the whole window, excluding entire
	  window.
	* Theme.cs: Added BorderSizableSize.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Fix RECT Height and Width. Don't fake styles here
	  anymore. Update calls to XplatUI.CalculateWindowRect due to API
	  chang
	* Form.cs: Update calls to XplatUI.CalculateWindowRect due to API
	  change. Fake the window styles here instead of in XplatUIWin32 so
	  that all back-ends get the same window styles (and it's Form that's
	  deciding when to use wm, not the Win32 backend anyways)
	* Hwnd.cs: Completely reworked GetWindowRectangle and
	  GetClientRectangle - they are now passed a CreateParams and they
	  only use Style and ExStyle to determine the rectangles (they should
	  now work just like Win32AdjustWindowRectEx - though quite a few
	  special cases are probably missing). They should also be 100%
	  complimentary (i.e. GetWindowRectangle (GetClientRectangle (rect))
	  == rect), and all numbers (borders, menu sizes) are taken from the
	  current theme. Added a GetBorders helper function that will return
	  the borders for any given CreateParams (including captions and
	  menus), and GetBorderSize that returns the given border size only.
	* XplatUIOSX.cs: Update calls to CalculateWindowRect and
	  Hwnd.GetClientRectangle.

2007-04-02  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridBoolColumn.cs: rewrite things a bit, and fix up the
	logic between the values we present to the user and the values
	which are stored in the column's property.  Also, don't call
	GetPreferredSize - it's virtual. Along the way, fix bug #80965.

2007-04-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Scroll faster!

2007-04-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* StatusStrip.cs: Layout fixes for PDN.
	* ToolStrip.cs: Set item's available to true, and placement to main when
	added.
	* ToolStripItem.cs: Fix an Available issue, check that Parent is really
	changing in setter before doing any work, add InternalVisible.
	* ToolStripPanel.cs: Remove unused variable to fix compiler warning.
	* ToolStripSplitStackLayout.cs: If we run out of things to hide, don't
	infinite loop.

2007-04-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBox.cs: LBUTTON does not make the textbox select all of it's
	text on focus.

2007-04-02  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Use the previous change in SetParent for forms only.
	  Makes ToolStripComboBoxes show up again.

2007-04-02  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Add a hover_pending field in ListView
	to fire just one OnMouseHover event for each MouseEnter/MouseLeave
	cycle (we are resetting the MouseHover logic in XplatUI
	to handle HoverSelection). Fixes #80429.

2007-04-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Make sure the attributes get set on the last
	tag.
	- Still have to do the end tag if we have stepped all the ways to
	the end.

2007-04-02  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIOSX.cs, XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIX11GTK.cs: Remove dependency
	on an internal libgdiplus call when the information is already 
	available via the public API.

2007-04-02  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: Call ContainerControl.ChildControlRemoved whenever a
	  control is removed from a control collecftion.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: The first location for toplevel form is (22, 22).
	  Fixes FormPropertyTest (failed on rare occasions).
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Add a workaround in SetParent for strange behaviour
	  of Win32SetParent (when changing from no parent to a parent it
	  might add the new parent's location in screen coordinates to this
	  window's location).
	* Form.cs: Rework ChangingParent once again, now the handle is
	  recreated whenever a FormWindowManager is added or removed (that is
	  whenever a normal form is parented or abandoned). Also change
	  CreateParams so that all non-toplevel windows always get the
	  specified sice (StartupPosition is never considered for
	  non-TopLevel forms).
	* ContainerControl.cs: Add ChildControlRemoved, the container control
	  needs to be notified when a control is removed from it's
	  collection, in the case the removed control is the active control.

2007-04-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: Use the new methods for setting the font and
	color, these methods set the specified attribute without
	overriding the other attributes.

2007-04-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripPanel.cs: Fixes for better layouts in PDN.

2007-03-31  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TextBox.cs: Added internal ChangeBackColor method to special-case
	Color.Empty. Added check for invalid ScrollBars value.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Added internal ChangeBackColor method.
	* RichTextBox.cs: Only set backcolor_set on 2.0 profile. Added
	internal ChangeBackColor method to special-case Color.Empty. Added
	check for invalid ScrollBars value.

2007-03-30  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuItem.cs: On invalidate prevent form to create handle. [Fixes #81272]

2007-03-30  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ScollableControl.cs: Add HorizontalScroll and VerticalScroll properties.
	* ScrollProperties.cs, HScrollProperties.cs, VScrollProperties.cs: Added.
	[Based on submitted patch from Olivier Duff.]

2007-03-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBox.cs: Only select all on initial focus if the user has not
	specified a selection area.

2007-03-30  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* UserControl.cs: Override CreateParams.

2007-03-30  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	[ Fixes #80995 ]

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs: Updated CalculateWindowRect parameters.
	* CreateParams.cs: Fix IsSet, wasn't working correctly when the style to
	  check for is a mix of several styles (such as WS_CAPTION for instance).
	* Control.cs: Don't paint an area bigger than the client area when painting

	  wants the location of the entire window, but the size of the client
	  window, so add TranslateClientRectangleToXClientRectangle,
	  TranslateWindowSizeToXWindowSIze and TranslatedXWindowSizeToWindowSize
	  to cope with this, and call them before every window creation and move.
	  Update CalculateWIndowRect to use Hwnd.GetWindowRect (one step towards
	  removing DeriveStyles). In AddConfigureNotify don't do anything if the
	  hwnd is a zombie (fixes the BadWindow we were getting while running the
	  tests), always calculate the offsets when it's a parentless window, not
	  only when reparented, and translate the window size, since we're getting
	  the client size of the whole window, excluding entire window.
	* Theme.cs: Added BorderSizableSize.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Fix RECT Height and Width. Don't fake styles here
	  anymore. Update calls to XplatUI.CalculateWindowRect due to API change.
	* Form.cs: Update calls to XplatUI.CalculateWindowRect due to API change.
	  Fake the window styles here instead of in XplatUIWin32 so that all

	  sizes) are taken from the current theme. Added a GetBorders helper
	  function that will return the borders for any given CreateParams
	  (including captions and menus), and GetBorderSize that returns the given
	  border size only.
	* XplatUIOSX.cs: Update calls to CalculateWindowRect and
	  Hwnd.GetClientRectangle.

2007-03-30  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs: Don't layout mdi children on MdiParent creation, the initial
	  layout of the mdi children is handled by CreateParams. Fixes
	  #79964,

2007-03-29  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Make OnMouseDown returns a boolean to identify if event is
	processed.

	* Form.cs: When active tracker mouse down is not processed, send event 
	back to control inside mouse position. [Fixes #81227]

2007-03-29  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Override the ComboListBox's ActivateOnShow property and
	remove WS_VISIBLE from CreateParams to prevent combobox dropdowns from
	stealing focus from the active form on Windows.  (Control will be made
	visible in ShowWindow.)

2007-03-29  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ImageList.cs : add internal Changed event.
	* ListView.cs : hook up to StateImageList.Changed to perform
	invalidations when the the state icon list changes. [Fixes #81191]

2007-03-29  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolTip.cs: Override the ToolTipWindow's ActivateOnShow property
	to prevent tooltips from stealing focus from the active form on Windows.

2007-03-29  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Small stetic fixes in notifyicon balloon. 

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs: Implement notifyicon balloon for clearlooks theme.

2007-03-29  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* NotifyIcon.cs, ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Icon support added to notifyicon
	balloons.

2007-03-29  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: When deleting text from non multiline textboxes,
	we need to update the entire document, because line offsets will
	be shifting.

2007-03-29  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* XplatUIX11.cs, ThemeWin32Classic.cs, Theme.cs: ShowBalloonWindow method
	added to theme, now we can create themes that uses diferent notify engines
	like notification-daemon from galago project or growl for Mac OS.

2007-03-28  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* NotifyIcon.cs: Prevent Balloon to show in task bar.

2007-03-28  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Prevent system to open more than one balloon.

	* NotifyIcon.cs: Prevent system to open more than one balloon and remove
	some compiler warning messages.

2007-03-28  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	[Fixes #79149]

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Implement SystrayBalloon for X11 systems.

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs, Theme.cs: DrawBalloonWindow and BalloonWindowRect 
	implemented, this methods is used by NotifyIcon.BalloonWindow class.

	* NotifyIcon.cs: BalloonWindow class added to support Balloon in X11 
	systems.

2007-03-28  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: Forgot to make Invalidate internal.

2007-03-28  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Add a InvalidateSelection method to
	invalidate methods which are currently selected, and call
	it when setting FullRowSelect and HideSelection, instead of
	calling Redraw.

2007-03-28  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (UnmapWindow): reindent this block.

	* DataGrid.cs (UpdateSelectionAfterCursorMove): we need to update
	the selection_start if we're moving the selection (that is, not
	extending it). Fixes bug #80461.

2007-03-28  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ProgressBar.cs: Make the default MarqueeAnimationSpeed = 100.
	* ToolStripPanel.cs: Fix RowMargin, Renderer, RenderMode, and
	create private ControlCollection.

2007-03-28  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: We need to call OnVisibleChanged for our implicit
	children as well as our normal children.  Fixes scrollbars in
	comboboxes not showing up.

2007-03-28  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs, Form.cs: Anywhere we call CreateHandle, we need to do
	the check for IsHandleCreated first.  The check in CreateHandle is not
	good enough because CreateHandle can be overriden, and the override 
	should not be called if the handle is already created.

2007-03-28  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Remove MonoTODO for tooltips.
	* ToolStripComboBox.cs: Fix MonoTODO for DropDownHeight and events.

	* ToolStripManager.cs: Add IsShortcutDefined.
	* ToolStripOverflow.cs: Override LayoutEngine.
	* ToolStripProgressBar.cs: Add MarqueeAnimationSpeed.
	* ToolStripSeparator.cs: Add ImageKey.

2007-03-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: If a char delete removes a line ending, we need
	to update the ending style.
	- Make sure the line ending calcs get called.

2007-03-28  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: CreateWindow: Remove old default form location code,
	  it was making the new code not work. Fixed a typo in the new code
	  as well. Fixes #79826.

2007-03-27  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs:
	- NIF_STATE and NIF_INFO added to NotifyIconFlags.
	- NOTIFYICONDATA properties sizes fixed, szTip is 128, not 64.
	- SystrayBalloon method implemented.
	[Add support for notifyicon balloon on win32, #79149]

2007-03-27  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs : update StateImageList selection to mirror
	the ms behavior when only one image is added to the list.
	[Fixes #81191]

2007-03-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Improvements to non multiline line ending
	drawing/measuing.

2007-03-27  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Fix the time which tooltip is opened for NotifyIcon. 

2007-03-27  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* NotifyIcon.cs: 
	- Balloon message handling added.
	- Call XplatUI.SystrayBalloon in ShowBalloonTip. 

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs,	
	XplatUIOSX.cs, XplatUIX11-new.cs: ShowBalloonTip method renamed 
	to SystrayBalloon to me like other Systray method, also a
	handle parameter added.

2007-03-27  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Show scrollbars even when items.Count == 0
	but the columns Width is bigger than the ListView.Width.
	Also, when columns.Count == 0 set layout_wd and layout_ht
	to the ClientRectangle values, so we don't show any scrollbar
	in that case.

2007-03-27  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* XplatUIStructs.cs: Balloon (NIN_BALLOON*) constants added.

2007-03-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: The RTF library decodes the text properly for us
	now.

2007-03-27  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Display HeaderControl even when columns.Count == 0.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Use SystemBrushes.Control to draw the
	ListView header (HeaderControl), instead of Control.BackColor.

2007-03-27  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Call OnVisibleChanged in SetVisibleCore for non-forms.
	Fixes tab control issues where controls would not show up because they
	never received their OnVisibleChanged call.

2007-03-27  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* NotifyIcon.cs: Balloon events added (BalloonTipClicked, BalloonTipClosed,
	BalloonTipShown).

2007-03-27  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: We won't get a WM_SHOWWINDOW when we create a window that
	is maximized or minimized, so move CreateControl to Control.OnVisibleChanged.
	* Form.cs: After we set the form visible, send a fake WM_SHOWWINDOW if we
	are max or min.  Remove WS_VISIBLE from CreateParams unless we are recreating
	the handle.  Fix WindowState by using the internal variable until we are 
	sure that we've been shown.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Do not generate a WM_SHOWWINDOW message if new form is
	max or min.
	[Fixes bug #81198]

2007-03-27  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Windows without WS_CAPTION can still get decorations
	  (at least borders). Fixes #79386 on Linux (with a small difference
	  in behaviour: when trying to resize a caption-less window metacity
	  shows the sysmenu. Resizing is still possible though).
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: When setting window styles send request an extra
	  WM_NCCALCSIZE when it's a form without title (due to no text and no
	  caption), since Win32 seems to calculate it wrong the first time we
	  get the message, though the second time things work as they should.
	* Form.cs: Reorder a few statements in ChangingParent, otherwise the
	  newly reparented window might show up unparented. Update
	  CreateParams to exclude WS_DLGFRAME if ControlBox is false and
	  there's no title text. Fixes #79386.

2007-03-27  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListBox.cs : don't perform invalidations if the handle hasn't been
	created.  [Fixes #80753]

2007-03-27  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListBox.cs : don't adjust top item when SelectedIndex is set to -1.
	[Fixes #80428]

2007-03-26  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Complete NOTIFYICONDATA structure, additional fields 
	needed to implement Balloon.

2007-03-26  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: In the constructors that take
	an array of strings, don't use ListViewSubItemCollection.AddRange
	method to add items, since we need to have a different behaviour (in
	the constructors we add an item for each null string, opposed to
	the behaviour of AddRange, which adds nothing).

2007-03-26  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* NumericUpDown.cs: Fix broken 1.1 api for ParseEditText

2007-03-26  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Draw and measure line endings when in non
	multiline mode.
	- When searching the text, count the end of the last line as a
	word boundary.

2007-03-26  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: The selection_start and selection_end don't
	really track the correct tags for the selection. So we'll manually
	compute the correct tag here.

2007-03-26  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* ProgressBar.cs, ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Implemented drawing of Marquee
	  and Continuous styles. Fixes #79469.

2007-03-26  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Implement Tooltips.
	* ToolStripItem.cs: Create internal method for determining tooltip.

2007-03-26  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* PropertyGrid.cs: Hide a EditorBrowsable attribute from 1.1 API.

2007-03-26  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* NotifyIcon.cs: On disposing verify if icon is visible and hide it,
	it prevents a problem thak keeps icon visible after application 
	closes on win32.

2007-03-26  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* NotifyIcon.cs: Balloon properties and methods created.

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs,	
	XplatUIOSX.cs, XplatUIX11-new.cs: Implement ShowBalloonTip method.

2007-03-25  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripComboBox.cs: Default the ComboBox's FlatStyle to Popup.

2007-03-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Make SetBoundsCore match MS better.  The BoundsSpecified
	parameter indicates which aspects were explicit/user-set.
	* ComboBox.cs, ListBox.cs: Call SetBoundsCore correctly. (no 0 parameters).

2007-03-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ProgressBar.cs: Throw AOORE instead of AE for property Value (2.0).
	* ScrollBar.cs: Throw AOORE instead of AE for properties LargeChange,
	SmallChange, and Value (2.0).
	* Timer.cs: Throw AOORE instead of AE for property Interval (2.0).

2007-03-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Always set item_control.Width in LayoutDetails
	if View is Details. Setting it later in CalculateScrollBars
	in a not-so-corner scenario (the sum of columns width is
	not bigger than the ListView width when handle is created, and then
	that sum gets bigger by increasing the width of the columns)
	causes a very weird recursion path (which shouldn't be happening,
	since header_control sets it in CalculateScrollBars too). This bug
	appeared after Chris' fixes for handle created issues, so probably
	it's related to some handle-creation time.

2007-03-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs (GetVisibleRowCount): increase the row count in the
	case where there's an add row, just so we don't end up in a case
	where it's not displayed (this happens when the row is partially
	obscured).  Fixes bug #79574.

2007-03-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs:
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	* RichTextBox.cs: Preserve line endings in the lines text buffer,
	also added an enum that represents the line ending type. 

2007-03-23  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* NumericUpDown.cs: Fix logic so Text and Value properties are not
	messed with in every method call, but only from DownButton, 
	UpButton, UpdateEditText() and ValidateText. Fixes #80346

2007-03-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs (GetFormattedValue): don't try to
	format objects if the format spec is "".  Fixes bug #80889.

2007-03-22  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* ToolStripPanel.cs (Join): added stubs to build PDN3

	* Control.cs (AutoScrollOffset): Add.

	* SystemInformation.cs (MouseWheelScrollDelta): Expose this
	property, its only implemented for Win32, on X11 it defaults to
	some hardcoded value.

	* ToolStripItem.cs (AllowDrop): Add property

2007-03-22  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs : in FullRowSelect Details mode, only enable box
	selection if the user clicks over the "item" column outside of the
	text area.  Mmmmm, compatibility.  [Fixes #80374 subpart 7]

2007-03-22  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: ChangeParent: Call Form's ChangingParent even if the
	  handle is not created yet.
	* Form.cs: Select: Don't call CreateHandle if the handle is already
	  created, avoids a stack overflow on Windows when we are recreating
	  controls.
	* ScrollableControl.cs: Set the correct z-order for the scrollbars when
	  they are made visible, and override AfterTopMostControl to keep
	  them on top when other controls are brought to front.
	  CalculateCanvas: Scrollbars are only visible if auto_scroll is true
	  or force_*scroll_visible is true (old implementation always shows
	  scrollbars when needed, no matter what auto_scroll was set to).
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: UpdateWindowDecorations: Add a
	  IsHandleCreated check.

2007-03-22  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: Implement Column and Row auto sizing when double-clicking on
	row or col separator.
	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs: Implement GetPreferredHeight and GetPreferredSize

2007-03-22  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Remove unneeded check for grab_control in UpdateCursor.

2007-03-22  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs: UpdateCursor method added, it is calling in OnMotion to update
	cursor for child controls. In ShowWindow and HideWindow now call SetCursor 
	every time. Fixes #80410.

2007-03-22  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* BindingSource.cs (AddNew): partially implement.

	remove a couple of NotImplementedException's
	to get bug #81148 closed.

2007-03-22  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	[Fixes #80380]
	
	* Control.cs:
	- UpdateCursor method added to update the screen cursor.
	- GetAvailableCursor method added to return cursor for enabled tree,
	it searches for cursor on control and it's parent's for enabled control.
	- Call UpdateCursor method on setter of Cursor property.
	- On setter of Enabled call UpdateCursor when it is false, we need to
	change cursor to normal (or to this parent cursor) because cursor 
	setting theres no effect to disabled controls.
	- Some minor source changes to follow the coding style guidelines.

	* XplatUIX11.cs: In MotionNotify only dispatch SET_CURSOR event for enabled 
	controls.

2007-03-22  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: ignore the BadPicture errors cairo+render
	generates.

2007-03-22  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Implement default locations for forms.
	* Form.cs: Completely rework startup location for forms. Fixes #79964.
	* Hwnd.cs: Add previous_child_startup_location (to track the current
	  startup location for any child forms of the current form) and
	  previous_main_startup_location (to track the startup location for
	  the current toplevel form).

2007-03-21  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Don't trigger a layout if an implicit control is added
	that isn't visible.  Also, don't notify the owner when an implicit control
	is added.  (Owners shouldn't even know about their implicit controls.)

2007-03-21  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ScrollableControl.cs: Add implicit controls with AddRangeImplicit
	to save some re-layouts.

2007-03-21  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs: In ProcessKeys returns false when key is not processed.
	[Fixes #81203]

2007-03-21  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* FlowLayoutSettings.cs, ToolStrip.cs, ToolStripPanel.cs,
	ToolStripPanelRow.cs: Lazy instantiate the LayoutEngine.

2007-03-21  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs : disable selection update for non-left button clicks
	with mods and over selected items.  [Fixes #80524]

2007-03-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs:
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Allow different types of line endings. \r, \r\n,
	\r\r\n, \n.

2007-03-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* ComboBox.cs: PreferredHeight seems to be ItemHeight + 6, but there is
	  very probably a more complicated calculation there. Update the
	  textbox' ForeColor and BackColor when the ComboBox' colors are
	  changed. Change the border change in LayoutComboBox to only affect
	  the textbox, not all the calculations there. Seems to fix most of
	  #79436.

2007-03-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* ComboBox.cs: Handle Home and End keys as well as all combinations of
	  modifiers + navigation keys as input keys, enables advanced text
	  selection in the combobox (like Shift+Left Arrow for instance).
	  ComboTextBox now overrides Focused and returns whatever
	  ComboBox.Focused returns, since it really should be focused
	  whenever the ComboBox is. Fixes #80795. Also make the border around
	  the text box one pixel bigger, as mentioned in #79436.

2007-03-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Don't offset the images, this was causing some
	artifacts when expanding/collapsing with images that were the
	exact height of the treenode.

2007-03-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* TrackBar.cs: Query the theme for the correct value when the mouse
	  moves and the thumb is pressed. 
	* Theme.cs: Added TrackBarValueFromMousePosition
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Reworked TrackBar drawing. Earlier
	  implementation was updating the trackbar value when drawing, now
	  the drawing methods only draw. Fixes #80900. Refactored the
	  calculations out to TrackBarValueFromMousePosition and
	  GetTrackBarDrawingInfo, so that TrackBar can get the correct value
	  according to the mouse position whenever it wants to. Changed the
	  light coloured pen when drawing the thumb from ControlLight to
	  ControlLightLight, because the ControlLight is the same colour as
	  the background so the 3D effect is lost. 

2007-03-20  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Form.cs: In ShowDialog uses MainForm as transient form when no form is
	defined. Fixes #80784.

2007-03-20  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* ContextMenuStrip.cs: align with the change introduced in
	revision 74664.

2007-03-20  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs, XplatUIX11.cs, 
	XplatUI.cs, Form.cs, ToolTip.cs: Remove unneeded parameter owner 
	in SetTopmost.

2007-03-19  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (WmPaint): don't make use of the Handle property
	after an event is emitted, as the user could have closed the
	form/destroyed the control.  Store the Handle in a local variable
	and make use of that.  Fixes bug #80768.

2007-03-20  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Set _NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE on SetTopmost, it fixes Topmost
	behavior in X11 environments.

2007-03-20  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Form.cs: Call SetTopmost in CreateHandle when window is topmost, its
	because on setter of topmost we dont call SetTopmost when handle is not
	created.

2007-03-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Need to use SelectionLength () not
	selection_length, since that var is reset to -1.
	- Draw the caret when we don't have focus.
	* TextBox.cs: The selectall actually doesn't occur until the first
	focus.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Need to update the caret position after a
	selectall.
	
2007-03-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Enable scrolling when using Tile view.

2007-03-20  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	[Fixes #80902]

	* XplatUIDriver.cs: Abstract SetOwner method created.

	* XplatUIOSX.cs: Override SetOwner to prevent compilation errors method 
	must be implemented and was masked as todo.

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: SetOwner implemented using SetWindowLong with 
	GWL_HWNDPARENT.

	* XplatUIX11.cs: SetOwner implemented using same code from SetTopmost but 
	cheking for null owner to remove transient. The SetTopmost will be change
	on a decond step.

	* Form.cs: In set_Owner and CreateHandle uses new SetOwner instead of
	SetTopmost. Now owned forms will work properly in win32 and X11.

2007-03-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Update function name.
	* Form.cs: After closing a form MdiParent is always null.
	* MdiClient.cs: Rename CloseChildForm to ChildFormClosed to explain
	  better what it should do: necessary book-keeping when the form is
	  closed, it should not close the form itself.

2007-03-19  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: Fix back and fore color. The subitems only
	use their own colors if they are set, otherwise use the listview's
	colors. Don't set default colors on constructor for subitem.
	Fixes #79315.

2007-03-19  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs : make box selection for Details views with 
	FullRowSelect conform to MS behavior when clicking in the "item" 
	column and clicking outside the defined columns.
	[Fixes case 5-6 of #80374]

2007-03-19  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ScrollableControl.cs: create the controls from within the ctor,
	but don't actually add them until our handle is created.  this
	fixes a NRE possibility jpobst found (if you override OnLayout in
	a subclass, it's called before your ctor).  Also, add a
	IsHandleCreated guard to UpdateSizeGripVisibility as well.

2007-03-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBox.cs: Reduce the amount of invalidation we do.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Make shortcuts enabled true by default, at least
	some of them are true by default on MS.
	- Add some functions to reduce the amount of invalidates we do.
	* TextControl.cs: Less invalidation.

2007-03-19  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	[ Fixes #81773, and *seems* to fix #81553 as well ]

	* XplatUIX11.cs: remove the assignment of hwnd.zombie = true from
	AccumulateDestroyedHandles.  We need to do it *after* we send
	WM_DESTROY, as the user's code can access Control.Handle in
	OnHandleDestroyed, and this shouldn't cause a recreation.  Also,
	move the WM_DESTROY/zombie handling to before the call to
	XDestroyWindow.  For some reason without this ordering
	FormTest.RecreateHandle hangs.  This ordering is semantically
	equivalent, however, as XDestroyWindow is async anyway.

2007-03-19  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* RichTextBox.cs: Reset backcolor_set after setting default.

2007-03-19  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ScrollableControl.cs: the scroll position should not effect the
	canvas size.  commit patch from georgegiolfan@yahoo.com, which
	fixes some really bizarre behavior on resizing.  Fixes bug #80778.
	
2007-03-19  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ScrollableControl.cs: clean this up a bit.  create the
	scrollbars in the ctor and just show/hide them as needed.  Also,
	make hscroll_visible/vscroll_visible internal to Recalculate, and
	just use hscrollbar.VisibleInternal/vscrollbar.VisibleInternal
	everywhere else.  This seems to fix the scrollbars appearing
	beneath the content for me (i have *no* idea why that is,
	however.)

2007-03-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Don't call DoAutoSize when we change Dock.  Also, remove
	some redundacy for stuff in Anchor and Dock that base will take care of.
	[Fixes #80762]

2007-03-19  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs : make box selection for Details views without 
	FullRowSelect dependent on the text bounds, not item bounds.
	* ListViewItem.cs : add an internal property to obtain the TextBounds
	in Details view.  [Fixes case 1-4 of #80374]

2007-03-19  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* PaintEventArgs.cs (Dispose): Only dispose of graphics object if
	we're < 2.0. #78448 && #80316

2007-03-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* FontDialog.cs: Don't crash when we switch to a new font that doesn't
	have the same style available as the previously selected one.  Also,
	support FixedPitchOnly property.  [Fixes bugs #80918, #80947]

2007-03-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Add an alignment property that all new lines
	will be given.
	- Make sure to use the align shift when calculating the line's X
	position.
	* TextBox.cs: Set the alignment on the document as well as on all
	the document lines.

2007-03-19  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: ControlCollection.Add: Remove a couple of duplicated casts and
	  throw if setting the parent of an mdichild that already has an
	  mdiparent. Update signature for 2.0 profile. ProductName: If there's no
	  AssemblyProductAttribute in the assembly, use the type's namespace (as
	  MS seems to do). CreateControl: don't create the handle if the control
	  is not visible (according to MS behaviour and spec).  SetTopLevel: Only
	  create handle if the control is not a form. Change FocusInternal to
	  virtual so that it can be overriden by Form.
	* TextBox.cs: Update call to FocusInternal.
	* Form.cs: Always create the handle when calling Focus on a MdiChild. The
	  form is not a toplevel form when it's a mdi child, so update is_toplevel
	  accordingly. ShowIcon/TransparencyKey: avoid creating the handle if it
	  hasn't been created. Show (IWin32Window): Don't allow this overload for
	  toplevel windows. CenterToParent/CenterToScreen/Select: create the
	  handle as MS does. SetVisibleCore: if called on a MdiChild and the
	  parent isn't visible yet, save the visibility and restore it when the
	  parent is made visible.
	* ScrollableControl.cs: Refactor out scrollbar visibility code to separate
	  methods, since the visibility of the scrollbars can be changed from
	  several places, not only from AutoScroll.
	  [Fixes #81179]

2007-03-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: Enable shortcuts by default.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Add conditional shortcuts.  

2007-03-19  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuItem.cs: Dont call OnDrawItem when OwnerDraw is false (#81182).  

2007-03-19  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	[ Fixes bug #80604]
	
	* XplatUIX11.cs (WaitForHwndMessage): change this to actually
	swallow the message we're waiting on, instead of delivering it, as
	this is only used for the WM_SHOWWINDOW raised from
	MapWindow/UnmapWindow, and the message needs to be generated
	(MapWindow, UnmapWindow): generate the WM_SHOWWINDOW message
	before doing the Map/Unmap.  Also make sure that the Hwnd is still
	alive after the message has been handled.

	*before* the window is shown.

	* Control.cs (CreateControl): guard a few more things inside the
	if (!is_created) block, as we might end up being called again -
	yay .net.
	(WmShowWindow): call CreateControl if we're showing the control.

2007-03-19  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: Fix 2.0 signature for Invoke. Support invoking on
	  controls without a handle if they have any parent with a handle. In
	  Dispose add a check whether the handle is created or not before
	  calling BeginInvoke, this removes the need of the extra disposing
	  parameter (which was bogus anyway since it didn't prevent the
	  invoke from happening, it only skipped the check for an existing
	  handle, meaning that the invoke would call on an inexistent
	  handle).

2007-03-19  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MessageBox.cs: Remove WS_POPUP from CreateParams style, with it form
	appears in taskbar.

2007-03-18  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MessageBox.cs:
	- Fixed a problem that dont show help button for messages with 3 buttons.
	- Refactory button size and position calculations, now dont use	fixed 
	values, also fixed button sizes (#80043) and form's border space.
	- AddButton method created, now all other AddButton methods call this one.
	- Some other source code cosmetic changes.

2007-03-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: Don't do this all fonts must match check if
	there is only one char selected.

2007-03-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: ScrollWindow works properly now, so we don't need
	to screw around with the scroll area.  This fixes some artifacts
	when expanding and collapsing.

2007-03-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Allow updating the selection position when the
	cursor is outside the textarea, but we have a capture.
	* TextControl.cs: A special case for when the cursor is outside
	the bounds of the TB.
	
2007-03-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Remove image pasting code for now.  There is no
	way to get an image on the clipboard right now anyways.
	* TextControl.cs:
	* RichTextBox.cs: Use the new RTF Picture class for pictures.

2007-03-18  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MessageBox.cs:
	- Set window properties in constructor intead of on CreateParams.
	- Remove topmost from Window ExStyle.
	- Set ShowInTaskbar to false.
	- Set form border to FixedDialog.
	- Some cosmetic changes and remove unneeded comments.
	- It fixes itens 2,3 and 4 of bug #80043.

2007-03-18  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: In setter for ReadOnly, only chance BackColor if
	none was explicitly set. Fixes part of bug #79949.

2007-03-16  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* ToolStripComboBox.cs: Add AutoComplete*.

2007-03-16  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* ToolStripComboBox.cs: Add FlatStyle.

2007-03-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs, ToolStripProfessionalRenderer.cs,
	ToolStripSplitStackLayout.cs: Implement some basic vertical toolbar support.

2007-03-16  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* ButtonBase.cs, ToolStrip.cs, SendKeys.cs, TextRenderer.cs,
	  CheckBox.cs, RadioButton.cs, BindingSource.cs,
	  DataGridColumnStyle.cs: Remove warnings.

2007-03-16  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Menu.cs: MergeMenu: Check menu argument for null before looping over
	  it.
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Add IsVisiblePending to track the pending
	  visibility of mdi child forms. FormSizeChangedHandler: update the
	  maximized size if size has changed while maximized.
	* MdiClient.cs: SizeScrollbars/ArrangeWindows/ActivateChild: Avoid
	  creating the handle.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: UpdateBorderStyle/FormSizeChangedHandler:
	  avoid creating the handle if not created.
	* XplatUI.cs: Update debug output.
	* XplatUIStructs.cs: Added ToString's for a couple of structs.

2007-03-16  Jonathan Pobst <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs: Give ToolStripManager the opportunity to handle
	ProcessCmdKey().
	* ToolStripDownItem.cs, ToolStripItem.cs, ToolStripItemCollection.cs, 
	ToolStripItemEventType.cs, ToolStripManager.cs, ToolStripMenuItem.cs:
	Implement keyboard shortcuts.

2007-03-15  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* CommonDialog.cs: Set StartPosition to CenterScreen on form's constructor.
	Fixes #79560 and #80200, it also fix problem in	FileDialog, SaveDialog, 
	ColorDialog and all derived classes.

2007-03-15  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	[ Fixes bug #79828 ]

	* ToolBar.cs:
	- Rename ToolBarButtonInfor to ToolBarItem.
	- Add all layout and calculation stuff gtom ToolBarButton to ToolBarItem.
	- Maintain an array of ToolBarItem, used instead of ToolBarButton
	collection to be able add same button more than one time on a toolbar.
	- Refactory all properties and methods to use ToolBarItem. 

	* ToolBarButton.cs: 
	- Remove all propeties and methods that is now in ToolBarItem.
	- Rectangle propery now gets the rectangle from first ToolBarItem to
	mimic win32 behavior.
	- Size calculation and layout methods also removed.

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Change all ToolBar drawing methods to receive
	ToolBarItem instead of ToolBarButton to right drawing buttons when
	same button/separator was added more than one time to ToolBar.

	* ThemeNice.cs: Same as above. 

2007-03-15  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Fire extra MouseMove events right after
	MouseDown and MouseUp, emulating win32's <censored> behaviour
	for apps that rely on it.

2007-03-15  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs:
	* TextBoxBase.cs: On MS, a fixed single border is not in NC area,
	it is drawn on the controls client window and there is no NC
	area.
	- Set the background color to gray on 2.0 when we are readonly.

2007-03-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	[ Fixes bug #81144 ]
	
	* XplatUIX11.cs: implement VirtualScreen independently of
	WorkingArea, by querying the _NET_DESKTOP_GEOMETRY root window
	property.

2007-03-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Hwnd.cs: add an internal field for the cached_window_state.

	* XplatUIX11.cs: cache the window state, invalidating the cache
	(and thus re-querying the X server) only when we see an update to
	the _NET_WM_STATE property.

2007-03-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* BindingSource.cs: get a lot of the unit tests working.

2007-03-15  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Modify UpdateStyles to store distances when bounds >=
	0 instead of just bounds > 0.  [Fixes bug #80912]

2007-03-15  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs, ToolStripItem.cs: Implement several new properties
	and methods.

2007-03-15  Ivan N. Zlatev <contact@i-nz.net>
	
	* ComboBox.cs, Control.cs, XplatUIStructs.cs, XplatUIX11GTK.cs,
	XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs, InternalWindowManager.cs,
	XplatUIOSX.cs, TextControl.cs: Replaces all uses of the custom
	WM_MOUSE_LEAVE with the system WM_MOUSELEAVE message.

2007-03-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	[ Fixes #81101 ]
	
	* Control.cs: add Ivan's fix for 81101, with a slight modification
	- you can set control.Target to null.

2007-03-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: If our OwnerItem is null, we can't use 
	HideDropDown, use Hide instead to prevent an NRE.
	[Fixes bug #81147]

2007-03-14  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Mess with the creation stuff a little. We need
	to calculate the document before the handle is created, in some
	cases. (Actually just one case).

2007-03-14  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Need to display the caret after letting the base
	wndproc handle the focus methods, because the caret display
	methods check the focus state.
	- Try to display the caret after updating it's position with SelectWord.
	- Don't need to do an immediate update on this recalc, since there
	will be an invalidate anyways.

2007-03-14  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Some workarounds so that we can match event order a
	little better.

2007-03-14  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ErrorProvider.cs: Invoke default ctor from 2.0-only ctor. Fixes bug
	#80803. Avoid NullReferenceException when Control does not have
	parent. Fixed different blinkstyle issues. Only subscribe to Tick
	event a single time. Only draw error icon when control is created and
	visible. Fixes failing unit tests.

2007-03-14  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Add support for 2.0 Deselecting, Deselected and
	Selecting events. Fire Leave and Enter events when changing tabs.

2007-03-14  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Add TreeViewNodeSorter.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Add sorter parameter to Sort method.

2007-03-14  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: go ahead and remove the RecreateHandles that jpobst
	removed earlier and I had him add back it.  It turns out metacity
	*does* in fact handle the MOTIF_WM_HINTS property changing, it
	just doesn't redraw the window titlebar until you resize the
	window.  This also means we aren't recreating the entire window
	hierarchy on X when you change this property.  And it looks better
	on windows, too.

2007-03-14  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs:
	* ListView.cs: Collecting selection information
	is now done in SelectedIndexCollection rather than in
	SelectedListViewItemCollection. This is done so we can
	have the selection information code in one single place
	(virtual mode selection information entirely depends on
	SelectedIndexCollection).

2007-03-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* ErrorProvider.cs: Add stubs for ISupportInitialize

2007-03-13  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: Trigger the ItemCheck and ItemChecked events
	in the right order with the right values, from the Checked property, 
	just as MS does (instead of triggering them from ListView).

	* ListView.cs: Make OnItemCheck and OnItemChecked internal.

2007-03-13  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Implement ItemChecked 2.0 event. Also cast to 
	the correct handler in OnItemCheck method (ItemCheckEventHandler 
	instead of EventHandler). This used to throw an InvalidCastException.

2007-03-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Calculate the document before the handle is
	created, so there isn't an extra invalidate called.

2007-03-13  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Don't set owner in ShowDialog until we are sure
	that we aren't going to throw an exception.  [Fixes bug #80773]

2007-03-12  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Make it compile.

2007-03-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Another place we don't call SizeFromClientSize.
	* Form.cs: Another place we don't call SizeFromClientSize.
	[Fixes bug #81125]

2007-03-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Basically emulating some strangness here with
	exanding nodes and setting node positions when windows aren't
	created.
	- Also attempting to walk the node tree less than previously, and
	just use visible order calculations for determining offsets.
	- oops made scrolling backwards.
	* TreeNode.cs: We need to start nodes with a zero visible order,
	because the order calcs are based on the first nodes order.

2007-03-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Don't exit the program if RecreateHandle is called on
	the main form.

2007-03-12  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XEventQueue.cs: remove the use of PostQuitState.

	* XplatUIX11.cs: remove the use of PostQuitState.  If we get a
	WM_QUIT message in GetMessage, return false (and if we're in the
	nested WaitForHwndMessage, repost the WM_QUIT message).

2007-03-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Don't call RecreateHandle when we change the MinimizeBox
	or the MaximizeBox properties.  [Part of bug #80640]

2007-03-12  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* LinkLabel.cs: When calculate pieces make LinkArea empty if theres
	no links.

2007-03-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: Fix some tests I broke by checking Visible
	instead of visible.

2007-03-12  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* FileDialog.cs: Use text of File name combobox to determine what
	files the user selected. Added tokenizer to parse the file names.
	Fixes bug #81123.

2007-03-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: We can't call SizeFromClientSize in the constructor,
	but we still need to do the same work, so make an internal version.
	[Fixes bug #80621]

2007-03-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs:
	* TreeNode.cs:
	* OpenTreeNodeEnumerator: Match MS better for IsVisible and
	IsExpanded.

2007-03-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Now that the handles are being created a little
	later, we need to make sure that the document is recalculated when
	the handle is created.

2007-03-11  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Theme.cs: GetLinkFont abstract method added.
	
	* LinkLabel.cs: 
	- Remove CalcTrimRectangle, no longer needed.
	- Factor also remove, position issues must be fixed in libgdiplus.
	- Move GetPieceColor to ThemeWin32Classic.cs as it is theme related.
	- GetPieceFont, CreateLinkFont and link_font removed, theme must be 
	care about font	used to draw links.
	- Set TabStop to true when control is "Selectable", control is selectable
	when have one or more links. Fixes #80501 (test case is also added).
	- Set the LinkArea values after links change, LinkArea values must be
	based in first link position and size, a test case was created.
	- Fix ControlStyles.Selectable value, now is based on LinkArea value, 
	the attribute must be true LinkArea.Length > 0. The same was applied to
	TabStop.
	
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: 
	- LinkLabelGetPieceColor and LinkLabelGetPieceFont created and used 
	in draw method.
	- Use CPDrawStringDisabled to draw disabled text instead of hard code 
	color change.
	- Draw focus rectangle for every parts focused, including parts that 
	is on another line, its because regions returns various rectangles
	and not only one. Needed to mimic W32 look.
	- Uses Graphics.Clip to delimite region painted, it mean that now 
	complete text is passed to DrawString, with this we solve layout
	issues without create another text renderer.
	- Uses Region.Intersect to fix some flickers problems, now only needed
	parts will redrawed.
	- This changes fixes #79614 and some other unreported issues, on Linux 
	some layout problems still remain, the problem is under 
	MeasureCharacterRanges but it is an libgdiplus bug.

2007-03-10  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TextBox.cs: Set for foreground color.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Remove Invalidate when setting BackColor, since
	this is already done in Control.

2007-03-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBox.cs: Set the background color, but reset the
	backcolor_set flag which is just for the user setting the
	background color.

2007-03-09  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: really remove the call to XplatUI.SetVisible from
	CreateHandle(), like I said I did when I merged the branch.

	* BindingSource.cs: implement some more of this stuff.

2007-03-09  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBox.cs: Don't explicitly set our background colors.
	* TextControl.cs:
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Draw readonly text.
	- Need to invalidate when backcolor or readonly are changed.
	
2007-03-09  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Don't set the forecolor until the handle is
	created.
	- Do not raise OnPaint, and removed some old debug code.

2007-03-09  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* ScrollableControl.cs: Fix mouse wheel scrolling.

2007-03-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Wire up MouseDoubleClick event.

2007-03-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Rework AutoSize to adjust height when docked to the
	top or bottom.
	* ToolStripItem.cs: Make Image drawing take ImageScaling into account.
	* ToolStripItemCollection.cs: Don't call owner.PerformLayout when a new
	item is added.  This logic was moved to ToolStrip.OnItemAdded.
	[Fixes bug #81090]

2007-03-08  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListVieItem.cs: SetIndex is only valid for 2.0 profile by now.

2007-03-08  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Show the correct image for selected node (this used
	to work, not sure how the code got deleted). Also implemented 2.0 feature
	SelectedImageKey.

2007-03-08  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs:
	* ListViewItem.cs: Cache index in items when retrieving them
	in VirtualMode.

2007-03-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: Don't return the explicit_size if we are using 
	AutoSize.  Fixes invalidation issue when user has explicitly set a
	size and has AutoSize = true.

2007-03-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Hardcode FrameBorderSize value temporarily to fix MWF.

2007-03-07  Pedro Martínez Juliá  <pedromj@gmail.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: Remove event handler from DataView when a
	DataTable is used as DataSource.

2007-03-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Create internal setter for client_size to allow it to be
	set without triggering resizing code.
	* Form.cs: Calculate client_size in constructor, only change client_size
	in FormBorderStyle property if Handle has been created.
	[Fixes #80574, #80791]

2007-03-08  George Giolfan  <georgegiolfan@yahoo.com>

	* SystemInformation.cs: Add TerminalServerSession.

2007-03-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeViewDrawMode.cs: Make internal for 1.1 to allow for consolidated
	TreeView code.

2007-03-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: The no_activate stuff was forcing us to create a
	Handle before we were supposed to.  Now checks ActivateOnShow property
	in Control.
	* Control.cs: Add internal ActivateOnShow property.
	* ComboBox.cs, Form.cs, MenuAPI.cs, ToolStripDropDown.cs: Return false
	for ActivateOnShow.
	* Hwnd.cs Remove no longer needed no_activate field.

2007-03-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Implement owner draw tree nodes.  And a couple more
	2.0 properties

	* DrawTreeNodeEventArgs.cs: Correct default value.
	
2007-03-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: create InternalWndProc so that we're guaranteed
	to be called before NativeWindow.WndProc.  Put the HwndCreating
	magic there to hook up our Hwnd's to handles.

2007-03-07  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* DataGridView.cs: Comment out debug code.

2007-03-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	[merge -r72718:73765 from mwf-handle-branch, and include 2 changes
	to make the rest of the world happy]

	* Control.cs (CreateHandle): there's no need to call
	XplatUI.SetVisible here, it's effectively done by
	XplatUI.CreateWindow on X now, and always was on windows.

	* XplatUIX11.cs (WaitForHwndMessage): only use the PostQuitState
	shortcircuit out of the loop if we have a message loop running on
	this thread.

	[Changelog from merge]

	2007-03-05  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

		* Control.cs (AccessibilityNotifyClients): turns out in 1.1 this
		causes handle creation.

	2007-02-28  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

		* ApplicationContext.cs: Add a flag to make sure we only raise the
		ThreadExit event once (ExitThreadCore can be indirectly called
		from a few places.)  I don't like the additional flag, but it
		makes the event ordering/count correct.

		* Application.cs (MWFThread.LoopCount): don't use an enumerator
		without locking the collection.  An enumerator doesn't give us any
		protection from modification anyway.  Lock the thread hash and
		replace the complicated enumerator loop with a foreach.
		(Application.CloseForms): make internal so it can be called from
		ApplicationContext.  This should probably be moved to MWFThread.
		(Application.ExitThread): don't call MWFThread.Current.Exit()
		here.  just call XplatUI.PostQuitMessage.  We'll exit the thread
		when the runloop exits (in response to WM_QUIT.)
		(Application.RunLoop): add a comment (and check) for
		context.MainForm being null after setting context.MainForm.Visible
		= true.  This is because you're perfectly free to dispose of a
		form in VisibilityChanged.  Chalk this up to another case where we
		need to synchronously generate WM_ACTIVATE from Control.Show.
		Also, add handling for WM_QUIT here so we'll exit the loop.
		
		* XplatUIX11.cs: clean up MapWindow and UnmapWindow a bit.  The
		fact that we don't wait if we're only unmapping the whole_window
		makes me a bit nervous, but it doesn't seem to cause any problems
		yet.

		also, add a comment about the stupid, broken and wrong resetting
		of PostQuitState to false in GetMessage().

		In PostQuitMessage, we need to add a WM_QUIT message to the
		thread's queue.  We use the FosterParent to get the right
		handle/hwnd/queue.

		Lastly, in SetVisible, we need to unmap both windows, since the
		waiting only happens when we're unmapping the client window.  So
		now, the *only* time we unmap just the whole_window is in the hack
		for resizing a control to 0,0.
		
	2007-02-21  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

		* Application.cs (CloseForms): rewrite this so that we don't
		modify the list while we're traversing it.

	2007-02-20  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

		* ListBox.cs (.ctor): move the Control.AddImplicits here instead
		of OnHandleCreated.
		(HorizontalScrollEvent): only call XplatUI.ScrollWindow if the
		handle is created.  otherwise we'll create it here.
		(VerticalScrollEvent): same here.

		* Application.cs (CloseForms): call Form.Dispose, don't post
		WM_CLOSE_INTERNAL.

		* Form.cs (WndProc): we don't need to use CLOSE_INTERNAL
		here. Application should Dispose() of the Form's.

		* XplatUIX11.cs (WaitForHwndMessage): break out of the loop on
		WM_DESTROY as well.
		(MapWindow,UnmapWindow): only actually do the waiting for
		SHOWWINDOW if the control we're dealing with is a Form.
		(CreateWindow): if the control isn't a form, SendMessage
		WM_SHOWWINDOW here (if the WS_VISIBLE style is set).

		* Control.cs (SetVisibleCore): always use is_visible here, not
		value.  If we use value, we can end up re-setting something
		visible if, for instance, you do Control.Hide() in a delegate
		attached to VisibleChanged as we do in FormTest.ShowDialogTest.

	2007-02-20  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

		* XplatUIX11.cs (WaitForHwndMessage): we need to loop until we get
		the message we need.  PeekMessage returning false should not be a
		condition under which we exit the loop.

	2007-02-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

		* Control.cs (Refresh): only refresh if we've got a handle and are
		visible.
		(CreateAccessibilityInstance): CreateControl() here.
		(UpdateChildrenZOrder): complicate the code loop even more by
		taking into account controls that haven't had their handle
		created, and those that aren't visible.  But on the flip side,
		simplify the code by splitting it into two loops.  one which
		builds up the list of child controls we're interested in, and the
		other that sets the z order of those children.

	2007-02-14  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

		* Control.cs: Control.AccessibilityObject causes the control to be
		created, not just the handle.

	2007-02-14  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

		* Control.cs: rework UpdateChildrenZOrder to correctly handle the
		problem on X where a window might have its handle created (and be
		visible) while the window is unmapped.  calling XConfigureWindow
		on an unmapped window is bad, and generates X errors.

	2007-02-13  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

		* Control.cs (CreateHandle): don't loop over our children setting
		their parent here.  do it when in WndProc when we're shown.
		(UpdateChildrenZOrder): make this internal so we can call it from
		ScrollableControl.
		(WndProc): for WM_SHOWWINDOW, reparent the child control after
		creating its handle.  Also, remove the calls to PerformLayout from
		here.  they're done in ScrollableControl.OnVisibleChanged.  Also,
		OnVisibleChanged only seems to be called directly here for the
		toplevel control.  It's propagated down the window hierarchy by
		calls to child.OnParentVisibleChanged.
		(OnVisibleChanged): don't do layout here - it's done (oddly
		enough, according to a glance at stack traces on ms.net..) in
		ScrollableControl.
		
		* ScrollableControl.cs (OnVisibleChanged): make sure we update the
		z order of our children before calling PerformLayout.

	2007-02-12  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

		[big change, fixes #80020]
		
		* AccessibleObject.cs: we need to make owner internal again to fix
		some of ControlAccessibleObject.

		* Control.cs: lots of changes here.  add support for WM_CREATE,
		for which we generate OnHandleCreated.  Remove the OnHandleCreated
		call from CreateHandle.  Also add support for WM_SHOWWINDOW where
		we create child controls.  leave the MonoTODO's for the
		accessibility calls, but fix the exceptions so the tests pass.

		Add the InvalidOperationExceptions to Invoke methods, and remove a
		couple of InvokeInternal methods we aren't using.
		
		Also, add a couple of CreateHandle calls in places where we know
		the handles are being created but our code doesn't reference
		.Handle.

		Make SetVisibleCore call OnVisibleChange if the handle isn't
		created.  If the handle is created, we rely on XplatUI.SetVisible
		generating the event synchronously.
		
		Lastly, make sure we don't use this.Handle inside CreateHandle,
		because we can call back into client (and that code can dispose of
		the control).

		* XplatUIStructs.cs: misc/cleanup.

		* XplatUIX11.cs: Map/Unmap X events correspond to WM_SHOWWINDOW,
		although we don't populate the wParam properly.
		(CreateWindow): generate WM_CREATE.
		(MapWindow,UnmapWindow): make these calls synchronous, at great
		performance expense (particularly in the unmap case), to match
		win32 behavior.

		* Form.cs (.ctor): remove the call to UpdateBounds. we don't need
		to call it.
		(set_MdiParent): don't recreate the handle unless it's been
		created already.
		
		* MdiClient.cs (OnResize): don't InvalidateNC Parent.Handle unless
		it's created.

		* NativeWindow.cs: this is probably the weirdest part of the
		patch.  We need a way to link up the window being created to the
		WM_CREATE message.  Since we can only be creating one window at a
		time on a given thread, we keep track of a per-thread reference so
		we can dispatch it properly.  We also need to keep track of the
		Hwnd currently being created so that the win32 backend doesn't
		have problems.
		
		* XplatUIWin32.cs: a similar change to the one we made in
		NativeWindow.cs.

2007-03-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: Make CalculatePreferredSize virtual.
	* ToolStripMenuItem.cs: Modify CalculatePreferredSize and OnPaint
	to draw the menu shortcut string.

2007-03-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Add the 2.0 collapse method.

2007-03-07  Pedro Martínez Juliá  <pedromj@gmail.com>

	* DataGridViewColumn.cs: Fix HeaderText behaviour (Bug #80746).

2007-03-07  Pedro Martínez Juliá  <pedromj@gmail.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: Change DataSource will clear column and row
	lists. Call Invalidate() to reflect DataSource change.

2007-03-07  Pedro Martínez Juliá  <pedromj@gmail.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: Add rows when DataSource is System.Data.DataView
	and a new row is added to it.

2007-03-07  Pedro Martínez Juliá  <pedromj@gmail.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: Add columns when DataSource is en empty list but
	is a System.Data.DataView (from a System.Data.DataTable).

2007-03-06  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Label.cs: Implement AutoEllipsis (2.0)

2007-03-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Implement 2.0 TopNode setter property.
	- Use a local var instead of the skipped_nodes field for computing
	how many nodes to skip.  Otherwise we won't scroll because the
	valuechanged handler checks if skipped_nodes is equal to the new
	value.
	- Implement 2.0 Sort method.
	- Add useless 2.0 DoubleBuffer property
	- Implement 2.0 LineColors property.  Lets you change the color of
	the lines in the tree. Terribly useful for creating non cohesive
	desktops.
	- Implement 2.0 image key feature.

2007-03-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: We can't get the bounds of the nodes before raising
	the AfterSelect event, because that event could change the node's
	bounds (scrolling, font change, etc).

2007-03-06  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: When faking styles don't remove the WS_VISIBLE flag.
	* Form.cs: Don't recreate handle when creating FormWindowManager, just
	  update window styles. In CreateParams us VisibleInternal instead of
	  VIsible to get the actual visible flag set for this form.
	* FormWindowManager.cs: Activate the form whenever the mouse clicks on
	  the nc area. Fixes #81042. Also fix HandleTitleBarDoubleClick to
	  handle the case when the form is already maximized, in which case
	  it should be restored. Fixes #81043.

2007-03-06  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Tool windows still get wm styles. Fixes toolwindows showing up with double decorations.

2007-03-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeViewHitTestInfo.cs: implement.

2007-03-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* InternalWindowManager.cs: class status fix.

2007-03-05  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* InternalWindowManager.cs: All windows that have a parent
	are confined to their parent when they're being moved.
	Fixes #80822.

2007-03-04  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* SystemInformation.cs: Marked KeyboardDelay and KeyboardSpeed public
	on 2.0 profile. Fixes bug #81018. Small code formatting fixes.

2007-03-02  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: ManagedWindowSetButtonLocations: Make all
	  buttons invisible before deciding which ones should be visible
	  (fixes minimize/maximize buttons showing up in toolwindows). Remove
	  an unused variable.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Remove warning.

2007-03-02  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Add a check in ListViewItemCollection.RemoveAt
	to throw an InvalidOperationException is virtual mode is being used.

2007-03-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* SplitContainer.cs, SplitterPanel.cs, StatusStrip.cs, TableLayoutPanel.cs,
	ToolStrip.cs, ToolStripContainer.cs, ToolStripContentPanel.cs,
	ToolStripControlHost.cs, ToolStripDropDownItems.cs, ToolStripItem.cs,
	ToolStripMenuItem.cs, ToolStripOverflowButton.cs, ToolStripPanel.cs,
	ToolStripPanelRow.cs, ToolStripProfessionalRenderer.cs, ToolStripSplitButton.cs,
	ToolStripStatusLabel.cs, ToolStripTextBox.cs: Corcompare work.

2007-03-02  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUI.cs: Fixed returning driver.KeyboardSpeed instead of
	  driver.KeyboardDelay from XplatUI.KeyboardDelay 
	* XplatUIW	in32.cs: Implemented KeyboardSpeed/KeyboardDelay properties
	  (patch by Sergey Volk)

2007-03-02  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* ToolWindowManager.cs: Added, contains logic for
	  tool windows.
	* CreateParams.cs: Add a few helper methods and an
	  internal variable to know which control the CreateParams belongs
	  to.
	* Control.cs: Call Form.ChangingParent when the
	  parent is about to be changed.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: DeriveStyles (): Set
	  caption_height for all windows that have captions and are children.
	  Update to use ToolWindowManager instead of InternalWindowManager
	  for ToolWindows.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Set fake window styles for all
	  windows that have window managers.
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Added MaximizedTitleButtons (buttons are
	  now duplicated for mdi windows when they are
	  maximized, first for the buttons the window itself has, then for
	  the buttons that appear in the menu bar. Makes things a little
	  easier). Updated UpdateWindowDecorations, SetWindowState and the
	  mouse eventhandlers accordingly.
	* Form.cs: Add ChangingParent (), contains the
	  logic of what should happen when the parent changes. In MdiParent
	  don't set things that ChangingParent () is doing. When handling
	  WM_CLOSE, we can close the form if there are any other modal forms
	  and the current form is a descendent of the modal form.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: A lot of refactoring,
	  the title buttons are now extracted to a separate container class
	  that takes care of all button code (clicks, tooltips, etc). Moved
	  Iconic|Maximized|Normal Bounds properties to this class from
	  MdiWindowManager, so that the window state logic can succeed for
	  other than mdi wm's. Implemented general window state change logic.
	  Moved CreateButtons to ThemeWin32Classic, since the theme might
	  override which buttons are available when as well as the exact
	  location.
	* FormWindowManager.cs: Added, contains logic for
	  normal forms.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: ManagedWindowSetButtonLocations now decides
	  which buttons go where (and if they are at all visible). 
	  Removed special handling of maximized windows, since they aren't special. 
	  In DrawManagedWindowDecorations don't try to draw the text if it is
	  empty.
	* MdiClient.cs: ArrangeIconicWindows: Don't  calculate any sizes, 
	  use whatever the wm gives us.

2007-03-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ButtonBase.cs: Add 2.0 properties.
	* Button.cs: Override Draw for 2.0.
	* Control.cs: Add Entered and Selected properties.
	* FlatButtonAppearance.cs, TextFormatFlags.cs, TextImageRelation.cs,
	TextRenderer.cs: Make internal for 1.1 to unify drawing code.
	* Theme.cs: New abstract functions for drawing Standard, Flat, Popup
	buttons.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Implement layout calculations for 2.0 buttons.

2007-03-01  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Don't use 2.0 methods in 1.1 code.  :/

2007-03-01  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Register a new class with Windows each time we get
	a new ClassStyle.  [Fixes bugs #79432, #80817]
	* Controls.cs: Set the correct ClassStyle in CreateParams.
	* ToolStripDropDown.cs: Don't request an invalid ClassStyle.

2007-03-01  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ListView.cs: Add fireEvent argument to ReorderColumn since the
	ColumnReordered event must not be signaled when modifying DisplayIndex
	of a ColumnHeader. Added internal ReorderColumns method which takes
	care of drawing, and updating the internal DisplayIndex of the
	ColumnHeader. Added AddColumn method which is invoked from
	ColumnHeaderCollection when adding or inserting columns, and which
	ensures that reorder_columns_indices is kept in sync. Avoid redrawing
	after adding each ColumnHeader in ColumnHeaderCollection.AddRange.
	Recalculated dispay indices after removing a ColumnHeader.
	* ColumnHeader.cs: Save DisplayIndex separately from ListView to
	match MS. Allows last display index to be returned after ListView
	is disposed. Update actual location of ColumnHeader when DisplayIndex
	is modified.

2007-03-01  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* LinkLabel.cs: Improve CalcTrimRectangle.
	
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Fix some compilation problem under VS 2003.

2007-02-28  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* LinkLabel.cs: Rename CalcMeasurementFactor as CalcTrimRectangle and
	get rectangle as a result value.

2007-02-28  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* LinkLabel.cs: Theres some diferences between rectangle return from 
	MeasureCharacterRanges and the area used for DrawString to fix this 
	CalcMeasurementFactor method was created, it calcules the diferences
	to be use later to adjust rectangle in draw operations. Fixes #80473.
	
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Use factor calculated by CalcMeasurementFactor
	to adjust draw rectangle.

2007-02-27  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: In DrawLinkLabel draw focus rectangle before draw
	text and some other changes to reduce and optimize source code.

2007-02-27  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* RadioButton.cs: Implement 2.0 event.
	* RelatedImageListAttribute.cs: Implement new class.

2007-02-27  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Change keynav_state before call SelectItem. Fixes #80901.

2007-02-27  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* CheckBox.cs: Implement 2.0 functionality.

2007-02-27  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Refactor Add and AddRange methods of
	ListViewItemCollection, to not update the ListView
	everytime an item is added in AddRange. Also move the update
	code to a new CollectionChanged method, and call it
	from other methods that need it as well (this should also fix some
	bugs when Sorting is used).

2007-02-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Try to never let the caret stay in a non-text
	tag.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Update the caret.

2007-02-26  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* XplatUIStructs.cs: Add some convenience methods for POINT structure.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Add some convenience methods for RECT structure,
	delete POINT structure, duplicate of one in XplatUIStructs.
	* TextRenderer.cs: Use XplatUIWin32.RECT instead of UXTheme.RECT.

2007-02-26  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ListView.cs: Initialize LabelEditEventArgs after setting Text of
	edit box since otherwise the Label would immediately be set (even if
	the user did not modify the label). In OnKeyDown set Handled to true
	if Return or Escape was pressed. In ColumnHeaderCollection unlink
	columns that are to be removed. In ListViewItemCollection unlink items
	that are to be removed.

2007-02-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextRenderer.cs: If we set a GDI clip region, we need to clear
	it when we are done.  [Fixes bug #80949]

2007-02-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Wrap checking ShowWithoutActivation in a NET_2_0 block.

2007-02-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: I forgot to commit the changes for ListView 
	in my previous patch.

2007-02-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Clipboard.cs: Partially implement an overload of SetDataObject.
	* Form.cs: Implement ShowWithoutActivation.
	* XPlatUIWin32.cs: Fix for WM_SHOWNOACTIVATE for forms.

2007-02-23  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	This is a first set of changes to make the Virtual mode works,
	by avoiding the retrieval of ListViewItem instances until
	draw time.

	* ListView.cs: Store item position in the ListView instead of the
	ListViewItem, this way we don't request the Bounds property of
	ListViewItem inside the ListView calculations, as well as cache the item
	size in item_size field. Store indexes instead of ListViewItem
	instances in the matrix used by icon view. Add a ItemMatrixLocation
	struct to hold the row and col info of the matrix info.

	* ListViewItem.cs: Don't store the location anymore, and only cache
	the rectangles for GetBounds. Use the ListView.GetItemLocation
	method to retrieve the actual location.

2007-02-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextRenderer.cs: Add clipping support, thanks to George.
	[Fixes bug #80949]

2007-02-23  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ListViewItem.cs: Cancel label edit when item is removed from 
	ListView.
	* ListView.cs: Move setting of focus to EndEdit. Fire BeforeLabelEdit
	event before the edit textbox is displayed.  Added CancelEdit method
	which is used end to editing while ignoring the value set by the
	user. In EndEdit, set focus to ListView to avoid losing focus to
	other controls. In ListViewItemCollection.Clear, cancel editing of
	any of the items.  In Remove, cancel editing of item being removed.
	Avoid udplicate code by modifing RemoveAt to invoke Remove.

2007-02-23  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* FileDialog.cs: Update FSEntry when move is successful. Fixes
	bug #80948.  

2007-02-23  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MainMenu.cs: Change Draw method to take care about MenuOrigin to be 
	compatible with non X11 systems. Fixes #80901.

2007-02-23  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ListView.cs: Added bool argument to UpdateMultiSelection to specify
	whether the item should be unselected and reselect. We do no want this
	when we're starting to edit the label. Do not fire the 
	SelectedIndexChanged event from ListView when its already been fired
	by modifying ListViewItem.Selected. Fixes bug #80943.

2007-02-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextRenderer.cs: Previos commit logic was backwards.

2007-02-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextRenderer.cs: Don't add padding on MeasureText if we were
	sent the NoPadding flag.

2007-02-23  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	after DrawButton. To prevent image overlaps button borders SetClip and 
	ResetClip added before and after draw image. Fixes #79129.

2007-02-23  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs: Use ClientSize instead of Size to specify 
	window size, it fix problem when you run under win32 that theres
	Size diferent than ClientSize. Also fix controls size and positions
	to mimic Win32. Fixes #80837.

2007-02-22  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Form.cs: Handle WM_NCHITTEST and return HTMENU when point is on 
	menu area to fix some problems for non X11 systems. Fixes #80613.

2007-02-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: When a node is expanded, set its is_expanded flag
	even if it doesn't have any children.

2007-02-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Calculate the top node 'on the fly', this
	eliminates issues where you need to click on the tree before
	scrolling it to get the top node computed correctly.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: We don't need to mess with the top node
	anymore.

2007-02-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* DataGridViewRow.cs: Fix typo so height can actually be set.
	Patch by Peter Grimm.

2007-02-22  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* FileDialog.cs: Fixed support for renaming files and directories.
	* ListView.cs: Do not lose focus when edit is canceled. Process
	Escape as regular key (to prevent closing of dialogs).

2007-02-22  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ListView.cs: Removed TODO for LabelEdit. Removed extra tabs and
	spaces. Changed spaces to tabs. Removed unnecessary init of bools.

2007-02-22  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* FileDialog.cs: LabelEditEventArgs.Label now returns null when user
	did not modify label.
	* ListView.cs: Only set LabelEditEventArgs.Label if user actually
	modified the text. Reset Label when user presses Escape in edit mode.
	Move focus to ListView after having cancelled or finished editing the
	label.

2007-02-21  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ComboBox.cs: Removed unnecessary initializations. Marked items field
	private. Clear textbox when Text is set to null and SelectedIndex is
	already -1.
	* FileDialog.cs: Removed unnecessary initializations. Removed 
	workarounds for ComboBox bugs that are now fixed. Modified
	DefaultExt, InitialDirectory and Title property to change null to
	zero-length string in getters. Avoid directly accessing fields.

2007-02-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Remove RecalAlignments call, that was some
	debugging leftovers.
	- Don't use the line indent when we shouldn't.
	* RichTextBox.cs: Add support for paragraph left indents.

2007-02-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Fix BeginInvoke signature for 2.0 profile.
	Seems like the class status pages doesn't catch params differences.

2007-02-19  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ComboBox.cs: Removed extra tabs. Changes spaces to tabs.

2007-02-19  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ComboBox.cs: Setting Text should have no effect if item text of
	selected item exactly matches value. First lookup text using
	case-sensitive comparison, and fallback to case-insensitive comparison.
	FindString(Exact) returns -1 if search string is null. On 2.0 profile, 
	allow startIndex to be last index. Changed ArgumentOutOfRangeException
	paramname to match MS. Restart from first item if string is not found
	after startIndex. Fixed paramname of ArgumentNullException that is
	thrown for null value in ObjectCollection.Contains.

2007-02-19  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* XplatUIStructs.cs: WM_XXX UISTATE elements uncommented.

2007-02-19  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* ListControl.cs: In SelectedValue use value.Equals to compare for
	equality instead of ==, otherwise it will fail for strings.
	Fixes #80794.

2007-02-19  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 
	
	* ComboBox.cs: Switch the order to ShowSelection and ActivateCaret,
	since the caret won't show up unless ShowSelection is true. 
	Fixes #80795.

2007-02-19  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Application.cs: When disabling all forms but the main form, do not
	  disable any descendants of the main form (such as mdi children or
	  other parented forms). Fixes #80822 on Windows.
	* Form.cs: If we have a parent, set the WS_CHILD style.
	* Control.cs: Update the window styles if the control whose parent has
	  changed is a form (the WS_CHILD style has to be switched).

2007-02-19  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* XplatUIStructs.cs: MsgUIState structure added.

2007-02-18  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* FileDialog.cs: Removed need for separate fileName field. On 2.0
	profile, do not check filename(s) for illegal character if filename(s)
	were set non-interactively but always check on 1.0 profile. Fixed NRE
	 in DefaultExt and only strip off first leading dot. Improve exception
	message when invalid Filter is set. Do not ignore InitialDirectory if
	it does no exist. Store specified Title, and if empty use default
	title (depending on type of dialog). Added an internal DialogTitle 
	property for retrieving dialog title. Fixed logic of displayed dir to
	more closely match MS. Avoid setting ComboBox.Text to a zero-length 
	string as its buggy.
	* OpenFileDialog.cs: In OpenFile, throw ArgumentNullException if
	FileName is a zero-length string (it can never be null). Override 
	DialogTitle property to set default title of dialog box.
	* SaveFileDialog.cs: Override DialogTitle property to set default
	title of dialog box.

2007-02-18  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* FileDialog.cs: Modify default text of filename and filetype labels
	to match that of MS. Reset do_not_call_OnSelectedIndexChanged...
	after we've updated the SelectedIndex. Fixes part of bug #80887.
	* SaveFileDialog.cs: Set text of filetype label.

2007-02-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* LabelEditEventArgs.cs: New internal SetLabel method, to set the
	label field. Needed by latest Jackson's fixes for ListView.

2007-02-16  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* PrintPreviewControl/PrintPreviewDialog: Properly dispose of 
	print preview images.

2007-02-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ListView.cs: Make AfterLabelEdit work correctly.
	* FileDialog.cs: After changing the name of the folder, we have to
	make sure that it is created, or that we pop up an error because
	it already exists.

2007-02-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Implement aliases on mime handlers, so things like
	System.String are mapped to text.
	- Handle dataobjects, getting all the possible formats out of them
	- We dont need the drag event args before we give feedback. This
	allows feedback cursors to be immediate before selections have
	been converted.

2007-02-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Modified the method for inserting images to
	taking a line and position instead of tag and position.
	* RichTextBox.cs: Handle PngBlip data by inserting the png image
	into the RTF file.
	* TextControl.cs: Allow images to be inserted as the first tag of
	a line.
	- Fix some off by one issues when we assume the first tag is a
	text tag, not an image tag.

2007-02-15  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Set focus to ListView when ItemControl gets a
	WM_RBUTTONDOWN message, to mimic .Net behaviour. 
	Fixes part of #80467.

2007-02-15  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DateTimePicker.cs: Call RecreateHandle if the Format changes and
	  validate Text input (if null or empty string reset Value to default
	  value). Fixes #80830.

2007-02-14  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Set owner as null for columns and items when
	Dispose is invoked. Fixes #80607.

2007-02-14  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs: Allow LayoutStyle.Flow, make sure to call OnOpening when
	showing DropDowns, don't show a Grip when doing Flow layout.
	[This fixes the toolbox in PDN 2.72.]
	* ToolStripItem.cs: Add Anchor property and some internal properties to
	reduces needed changes to FlowLayout.
	* ToolStripOverflow.cs: Remove unused variable.
	* ToolStripSplitStackLayout.cs: If a ToolStripItem isn't visible, don't
	use it in the layout calculations.

2007-02-13  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ToolTip.cs: Add HotkeyPrefix.Hide to MeasureString format, it fix an issue
	reported in #79640.
	
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Uses format for MeasureString in ToolTipSize to fiz
	size calculation.

2007-02-13  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ToolBar.cs, ToolBarButton.cs: Revert and remove HotkeyPrefix from 
	MeasureString format, it can make button very large in some cases, it is
	strange but is what win32 do.

2007-02-13  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ToolBar.cs, ToolBarButton.cs: Uses format in MeasureString to fix string 
	size calculation.

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Set HotkeyPrefix in toolbar text format to fix text
	rendering, the value is based on MenuAccessKeysUnderlined.

2007-02-13  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Theme.cs: Change MenuAccessKeysUnderlined to "true" that is value used
	for most themes.
	
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Override MenuAccessKeysUnderlined as false.
	
	* ThemeNice.cs, ThemeGtk.cs, ThemeClearlooks.cs: Remove always_draw_hotkeys
	and use MenuAccessKeysUnderlined instead.

2007-02-13  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs: Focus fix for nunit treeview selection bug.
	A selected control would not get a Focus call if:
		- the default active control of the container is the same as
		  the one that was selected
		- we are switching from one container to another
	Under these conditions, the container being selected already has
	an active_control, which is the same as the one being activated, 
	so set_ActiveControl would always return and not send the Focus
	call. Fix to check if the currently active control of the container
	is actually focused.

2007-02-13  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* StatusStrip.cs: Implement the spring layout.
	* ToolStripControlHost.cs: Make sure the hosted control's visibility
	always matches the host.
	* ToolStripItem.cs: Write a more accurate layout for TextBeforeImage
	and TextAfterImage.

2007-02-13  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Code reorganization only.
	  - Reorganize the WndProc cases so that each case has it's own handling method, 
	  to help with the no-line-numbering stack traces.
	  - Formatting changes (it's vstudio's fault, really :p)

2007-02-13  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* MonthCalendar.cs: Switch to using Thread.CurrentCulture instead of
	  Thread.CurrentUICulture to match DateTimePicker's (and MS)
	  behaviour.

2007-02-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs:
	* TextBox.cs: By default we have a non multiline document
	- use the multiline property instead of the internal variable
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Treat multiline and non multiline the same in
	most places.
	- Use the documents multiline flag instead of tracking it ourself
	* TextControl.cs: Attempt at getting multiline to match MS
	behavior.  Lines now track an offset, which is either their X or Y
	offset depending on whether or not we are in multiline mode.
	- Update all the methods to understand that lines have an X value.
	- Fix crash in Undo::Duplicate when empty lines are deleted.

2007-02-12  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Label.cs: CalcPreferredHeight and CalcPreferredWidth methods removed and 
	code moved to properties PreferredHeight and PreferredWidth. It solve the
	all problems when preferred sizes must be recalculated. Fixes #80801.

2007-02-12  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Label.cs: Fix CalcPreferredHeight for 2.0 that must return only
	font height when compatible_text_rendering is false. Partially fix #80801.

2007-02-09  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Form.cs: Fixed typo in exception message. Fixes bug #80779.

2007-02-09  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Form.cs: Improved exception messages in ShowDialog.

2007-02-09  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* PrintDialog.cs: On 1.0 profile, throw ArgumentException in RunDialog if
	PrinterSettins has not been set. On 2.0 profile, initialize PrinterSettings
	if not set. Fixes bug #80764. Avoid accessing current_settings field
	directly.

2007-02-08  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Theme.cs: An new property MenuAccessKeysUnderlined added with default value
	false.

	* SystemInformation.cs: An new property MenuAccessKeysUnderlined added, it is
	public in 2.0 and for easy maintenance and dont break compatibility it is 
	internal in 1.1.
	
2007-02-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: Implement using images from ImageList.

2007-02-08  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DateTimePicker.cs: Change default date-formatting culture from
	  CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture to CurrentThread.CurrentCulture,
	  seems to be the way MS does it.

2007-02-08  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* PrintPreviewControl.cs: rewrite toolbar code to fix #80725. Correct 6-up image 
	(the 6 was cut off on the right side)

2007-02-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Tell MenuStrips to close when the form is clicked.
	* MenuStrip.cs, ToolStrip.cs, ToolStripControlHost.cs, 
	ToolStripDropDown.cs, ToolStripDropDownItem.cs, ToolStripItem.cs,
	ToolStripItemCollection.cs, ToolStripMenuItem.cs, ToolStripProfessionalRenderer.cs,
	ToolStripSplitButton.cs, ToolStripSplitStackLayout.cs: Add 
	support for Overflow, where items that do not fit are automatically
	reparented to a drop down menu.
	* ToolStripOverflow.cs, ToolStripOverflowButton.cs: Added.
	Also: fixes bug #80747.

2007-02-08  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* ComboBox.cs: Remove warning (unused code).
	* ScrollableControl.cs: Remove warning for 1.1 profile.

2007-02-08  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs: Remove a warning.

2007-02-08  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DateTimePicker.cs: Fixed a NRE if CustomFormat was null. Handles the
	  'g' specifier, not documented anywhere, but seems to always show up
	  as a single space (might have something to do with the DateTime 'g'
	  specifier, which is the era format, but since DateTimePicker can't
	  go earlier than 1753 it wouldn't matter) . Fixed quote handling,
	  won't crash if the format has an unmatched quote. Now shows
	  single-character formats correctly. Fixes #80744.

2007-02-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* StatusStrip.cs: Stretch property needs to call base.Stretch,
	not this.Stretch to fix stack overflow. [Fixes bug #80760]

2007-02-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs (DrawButtonBase): don't clear to the
	background color.  it overwrites the background image we've
	already painted.  Fixes #80599.

2007-02-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: return immediately from Edit() when there are no
	columns.  Fixes #80662.

2007-02-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* MessageBox.cs: fix #80625.  don't always show the Help button in
	2.0.  use the displayHelpButton parameter to determine if we
	should show it. Also, make the internal show_help field private.

2007-02-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (SetVisibleCore): check in the proposed patch for
	80604, and set is_visible before calling CreateControl.

2007-02-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ListView.cs: UseCompatibleStateImageBehavior setter changed from NIEX to 
	MonoInternalNote.  This is added automagically by VS2005, so let's not crash
	on it.

2007-02-06  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs: hotkey_active internal field added, it is required because
	we need to know when hotkeys must be draw, before this change a keystate
	Navigating was used but we can have menu in navigating state without
	hotkeys. Fixes #80694.
	
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Only draw hot keys when hotkey_active is true.

2007-02-06  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: Handle WM_CAPTURECHANGED in 1.1 code as well, and change
	  corresponding events and methods to be internal for 1.1 profile and
	  public for 2.0 profile (required by SizeGrip).
	* Form.cs: Use SizeGrip as a virtual SizeGrip (and don't add it to the
	  implicit control list). Don't set the size nor the location of the
	  SizeGrip anymore as it's not needed.
	* SizeGrip.cs: Rewrote large parts, it now supports a virtual mode to
	  draw directly on the captured control (fixes #80656). Removed
	  ShowGrip (it wasn't used anywhere), redraw (always true), added
	  GetDefaultSize and GetDefaultRectangle to calculate defaults.
	* ScrollableControl.cs: Make UpdateSIzeGripVisible internal so it can
	  be called from SizeGrip.

2007-02-06  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Timer.cs: Throw ArgumentException if Interval <= 0.

2007-02-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: We need to check scrollbar visibility when window
	visibility is updated, because non visible trees don't ever add
	scrollbars.
	* Cursor.cs: We want the override cursor to be reset to NULL when
	we set current cursor to the default cursor.

2007-02-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Don't have crlfs when we are non multiline.
	- Consolidate the line position.

2007-02-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Keyboard.cs: BACK+CTRL gets a special char code.

2007-02-03  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Implemented WM_CAPTURECHANGED support, we're now
	  handling LeaveNotify->NotifyUngrab in order to send
	  WM_CAPTURECHANGED. However sometimes the NotifyUngrab arrives late
	  after calling XUngrabPointer, so we call WindowUngrabbed directly
	  from UngrabWindow in order to send WM_CAPTURECHANGED immediately.
	* Control.cs: Handle WM_CAPTURECHANGED in order to raise
	  MouseCaptureChanged correctly. Also create handles if changing
	  Capture (matches MS behaviour).

2007-02-02  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* SizeGrip.cs: Make the last change 2.0 only.

2007-02-02  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* SizeGrip.cs: If resizing and the capture is lost, revert any size
	  changes to initial size (fixes #80597).

2007-02-02  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* SizeGrip.cs: Use the normal icon for SizeGrip if it is disabled.

2007-02-02  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* SizeGrip.cs: Only draw sizegrip if enabled (but always draw
	  background) and only allow dragging if enabled. This way the
	  sizegrip can be used to fill the open square that otherwise would
	  have been shown in the bottom right corner of ScrollableControl
	  when ScrollableControl is not suppose to support sizing.
	* ScrollableControl.cs: Create UpdateSizeGripVisible to decide when the
	  sizegrip is shown and enabled, and hook up with necessary events.

2007-02-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs: clean up the
	GetFormattedString/GetColumnValueAtRow combination of functions.
	Also fix UpdateUI, and the initial state of
	IsInEditOrNavigateMode.

	* DataGridTextBox.cs: don't chain up to base.OnMouseWheel - we
	aren't supposed to scroll the textbox here, we're supposed to
	scroll the datagrid.

2007-02-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: use vscrollbar_ctrl.Dock instead of explicitly
	setting the position.

2007-02-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs (OnLeave): we can now do the CancelCurrentEdit thing
	here, since the most recent focus fixes keep us from generating
	the Leave event when our textbox gets focus.
	(Edit): we should be passing null for the column style's
	instantText parameter.
	
2007-02-01  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripDropDownItem.cs: Make sure DropDownOpening event is 
	raised.  Fixes menu text/icons not showing up in PDN.

2007-02-01  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Remove code in constructor that makes every
	control with WS_CHILD set have initial location -1, -1.

2007-01-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Take the keyboard on init to reduce coupling with
	XplatUIX11.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Give teh keyboard to teh dnd.

2007-01-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Use IDataObject instead of the DataObject class.
	- Remove some debug code.

2007-01-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: If you set the override cursor during a grab, it
	should actually override the grab cursor.  This comes into play
	when you are setting custom cursors in a DND feedback method.

2007-01-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Add support for handling the QueryContinue and
	GiveFeedback events.
	- Cancel drag and drop actions when the escape key is clicked.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Let the dnd subsystem get key events, so that it
	can handle the ESCAPE key.
	- Allow dnd to swallow BUTTONUP messages if it needs to.  This is
	done when dnd events are continued after the button is released.
	- Add a new helper method so that dnd can translate key events.

2007-01-31  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Rewrite of Jacksons OnClickCancelButton patch to
	make it more obvious what is happening.

2007-01-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Don't break when handling button release in drag
	and drop operations. We need that BUTTONUP message to get through
	so capture is released.
	* X11Dnd.cs: We don't need to manually grab the pointer anymore,
	this is handled automatically when the mouse is down.

2007-01-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: OnClickCancelButton gets called whenever the dialog
	is closed, so we need to make sure that we aren't changing the
	dialog result when the OK (Open or Save) button has been clicked
	and we are closing the window ourselves.  Note we don't need to
	worry about the cache being written in this case, because it was
	already done in the previous FilOk call.

2007-01-30  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>
	
	* DateTimePicker.cs: Remove a warning.
	* ComboBox.cs: Remove a couple of warnings.

2007-01-29  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: don't crash, and remove the icon if the user has
	set one, if SetIcon is passed a null icon.

2007-01-29  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* TextBox.cs: Redraw when the password characters changes
	* TextControl.cs: Check if textbox has a password char and draw 
	a line of password chars instead of the text in the line. LineTag gets 
	an extra Draw() method which allows document.Draw to override the text 
	that will be drawn. Removes 1024 char limitation on length of passworded 
	lines.

2007-01-29  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Deleting sections of text is undoable.  Deleting
	single chars is not.

2007-01-28  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextRenderer.cs: Fix cutting off the bottom of letters like "j" by
	one pixel.  Fix a StackOverflowException caused by an overload wrongly
	calling itself.

2007-01-26  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Fixed kerboard grab problem when "enter"key is pressed,
	also remove ProcessArrowKey and put the code inside ProcessKeys.

2007-01-26  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* PaddingConverter.cs: Added.

2007-01-26  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>
	
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Only draw the text of a StatusBar if
	ShowPanels is false (fixes #80600). Only draw up to 127 characters
	of text (fixes #80601). For panels clip the text to draw to the
	panel (fixes #80603).

2007-01-26  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Fixed implementation of ResetText.

2007-01-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: For the last char of a line we need to use the
	line size, not that chars width, since it won't actually be
	computed since the right side of a char is based on the start of
	the left side of the next char, and the next char does not exist.

2007-01-25  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Splitter.cs: fix the new unit tests, and reindent some switch
	statements.

2007-01-25  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Implemented 2.0 methods and events.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Added OnTextUpdate, so that
	ComboBox.ComboTextBox can inform ComboBox of it.

2007-01-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Respect ShowSelection when deciding whether or
	not to display the caret, this allows comboboxes to have carets
	when the combotextbox does not have focus.

2007-01-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Add a Suspend/Resume for updating, basically the
	same as the Suspend/Resume for recalc, except this will do actual
	Invalidates.
	- New Undo manager, works much like the MS version.
	- Implemented Redo
	* TextBoxBase.cs: The Cut operation is undoable.

2007-01-25  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>
	
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Don't antialias text. Makes it look way better
	on Windows (no difference on Linux).	

2007-01-25  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Set SWP_NOACTIVATE in RequestNCRecalc as well,
	we don't want to activate any windows. Fixes #79433.

2007-01-25  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	- ButtonBase.cs: Fix capitalization of parameter: disposing.
	[Fixes bug #80609]

2007-01-25  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs:
	- Move to using System.ComponentModel.EventHandlerList
	- Replace Refresh with Invalidate
	- Clear the mime filecache on closing
	- Some other memory reducing work. After beeing closed FD now uses
	  only about 300 KB for the fdo mime stuff plus the memory of the
	  cached icons.
	* Mime.cs: Changed coding style and removed unnecessary commented
	code. Some more memory memory reducing work.

2007-01-25  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Implemented FlatStyle and DropDownHeight, and added
	a few other missing 2.0 properties.
	* Theme.cs: Added DrawFlatStyleComboBox.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Implemented DrawFlatStyleComboBox.

2007-01-24  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: fix the wake_waiting logic - we always clear the
	wake_waiting flag, not just when there's data to be read.  if we
	don't, then future wakeup's won't reach us and we'll be doomed to
	wait for the entire 1 second timeout forever (unless there are X
	events to be had).

2007-01-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: FindStringExactMaxException doesn't throw AOORE on 2.0
	until you pass Items.Count, not Items.Count - 1 like 1.1.

2007-01-24  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ColumnHeader.cs: Fixed ParamName in ArgumentOutOfRangeException.

2007-01-24  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripContainer.cs: The recent Dock fix exposed that I was
	adding the panels in the wrong order.

2007-01-24  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: When we move the caret we also need to move the
	selection, this fixes some random crashing after doing select
	text, unselect, delete a char, paste.

2007-01-24  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: Update SizeGrip's location even if it's not visible (fixes #80592).

2007-01-23  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Control.cs: In OnParentBackgroundImageChanged remove conditions to call
	OnBackgroundImageChanged, it mimics win32 behavior. Fixes #80553. 
	* ToolBar.cs: Force redraw in BackgroundImageChanged.

2007-01-23  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ToolBar.cs:
	- Implement support for vertical toolbars. Fixes #80539;
	- Call LayoutToolBar when resize, it fix some other problems in layout.
	- Rename requested_height to requested_size, as we can have width on it
	when toolbar is vertical.
	- Create a private property "Vertical" that uses Dock to verify when 
	toolbar is vertical or not.
	- Set ControlStyles when change Dock property.
	- Refactory in LayoutToolBar to have better variables names and to support
	vertical toolbars.
	- Fixes default value for ButtonSize when button count is equal zero, size
	must be (39, 36) test case writed.

2007-01-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: fix the checks so that they work correctly for mdi
	parents/children.

2007-01-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: ControlCollection seems to have super-secret
	abstraction breaking knowledge of Mdi containers.  allow MdiClient
	to add toplevel controls.

2007-01-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: throw an ArgumentException if a toplevel control is
	added to our control collection from ControlCollection.Add, as
	well as from ControlCollection.IList.Add.  This fixes the
	ControlSetTopLevelTest.TestTopLevelAdd unit test.

	Also, in ControlCollection.IList.Add, don't through an
	ArgumentNullException, throw an ArgumentException, when value ==
	null.  This matches MS.

2007-01-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* BindingSource.cs: initial, incomplete, implementation of
	BindingSource.

2007-01-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs:
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Checking in some pieces of the undo stuff so
	that I can fix a broken unit test (TextBoxTest::ClearUndo)
 	
2007-01-23  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ToolBar.cs: Add status fields to ToolBarButtonInfo.

2007-01-23  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Add new 2.0 ImageKey and SelectedImageKey properties.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: New Add() methods, ContainsKey and
	IndexOfKey() for 2.0

2007-01-23  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* XplatWin32.cs: In RequestNCRecalc call SetWindowPos with SWP_NOZORDER
	to prevent it from changing z-order.
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Refactor part of SetWindowState to MdiClient, only
	leave UI updates in MdiWindowManager.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Check for 0 sized nc areas and make them
	1 sized (NC handling goes weird on Linux otherwise).
	* MdiClient.cs: Add missing ExStyle (WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE), so it's no longer
	necessary to handle WM_NCCALCSIZE anymore. This also made it possible to
	remove a few NCRequestRecalcs. Changed calculations in IconicBounds
	to use ClientSize of MdiClient instead of entire size. Refactored ActivateChild
	and SetWindowState(s) to allow for changing the size of an activated child
	before activating it (reduces a lot of flicker).

2007-01-22  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Changing FormBorderStyle has different semantics based
	on whether the Form is visible or not.  If not visible, don't change
	the Size.  But InvalidateNC needs to be called to force the window
	to pick up the changes and redraw itself.  [Fixes bug #80574]

2007-01-22  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	[Moma work]
	* ContainerControl.cs: ProcessCmdKey.
	* ErrorProvider.cs: new constructor.
	* Form.cs: fix AutoValidateEvent compiler warning.
	* Label.cs: fix OnAutoSizeChanged compiler warning.
	* MenuStrip.cs: fix CanOverflow compiler warning.
	* TabControl.cs: SelectTab, OnSelected methods, Selected event.
	* TextBox.cs: Dispose.
	* ToolStrip.cs: CanOverflow, re-enable double buffering.
	* ToolStripControlHost.cs: fix CausesValidation compiler warning.
	* ToolStripDropDown.cs: fix ContextStripMenu compiler warning.
	* ToolStripItem.cs: Overflow, RightToLeft properties.

2007-01-22  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: Move the layout of the main form to MdiWindowManager.
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: If WindowState changes from or to Maximized,
	do a layout of the main window to update MdiClient's client area to
	the right area. Fixes #80533. Remove the calculation of nc size, 
	it was just wrong and the correct one is the same as for 
	InternalWindowManager. 

2007-01-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Setting Anchor or Dock needs to reset the other
	to its default.  [Fixes bug #80556]

2007-01-20  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* CheckedListBox.cs: class status changes.

	* ScrollableControl.cs: same.

	* RichTextBox.cs: same.

	* ContainerControl.cs: same.

	* ListView.cs: same.

	* NotifyIcon.cs: same.

	* MenuStrip.cs: same.

	* RadioButton.cs: same.

	* CheckBox.cs: same.

	* PrintPreviewDialog.cs: same.

	* Form.cs: same.

2007-01-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Apply Alan's patch for Name property.

2007-01-19  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>
	
	* Form.cs: Implemented SizeGripStyle.
	* SizeGrip.cs: Check for minimum and maximum size for the
	control being resized and only resize if size has actually
	changed.

2007-01-19  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs: stop setting _readonly in the
	PropertyDescriptor setter.  fixes a unit test failure.

	also, rename ParentReadOnly to TableStyleReadOnly, and have it
	just consult our table style (if we have one).  We don't need to
	consult the datagrid readonly attribute because that's passed in
	as the _ro arg to Edit.  this simplifies things a little.
	
	* DataGrid.cs: use CurrentColumn instead of
	current_cell.ColumnNumber just to simplify some of the code.

	switch the order of some things in the CurrentCell setter to keep
	the previous cell from getting a textbox again -
	EnsureCellVisibility causes scrolling to happen, which calls Edit.
	So we need to set the new cell before calling it.
	
	call Edit in OnEnter, as does Microsoft.
	
	also, make sure the current table style isn't the one we create
	initially when checking to see if it's different than the one
	we're setting it to in BindColumns (this fixes #80421).

	* GridTableStylesCollection.cs: table styles can have "" for a
	mapping name.  part of the fix for #80421.

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs: simplify the readonly calculation in
	Edit significantly.

2007-01-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TextRenderer.cs: Rewrote to be complete-er, more MS-matching-er,
	and less GDI object leaky-er.

2007-01-18  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* LinkLabel.cs: Add opaque control style

2007-01-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Calculate width properly.
	- Don't store the tag's X offset, this can be figured out very
	easily.
	- When getting the caret tag make sure to get the last empty tag.

2007-01-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Recalculate our size after setting a new FormBorderStyle.
	[Fixes bug #79959]

	* Control.cs: Color.Empty shouldn't count for previous transparent
	redraw changes.

2007-01-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBox.cs:
	* RichTextBox.cs:
	* TextControl.cs: Starting to merge in some pieces of my older
	undo work.  Basically just some slight cleanup of the undo API.

2007-01-18  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* TrackBar.cs: Fix signature of RightToLeftLayout.
	* StatusBar.cs: Implemented missing 2.0 methods and attributes.
	* StatusBarPanel.cs: Implemented missing 2.0 methods and attributes.
	* Application.cs: Implemented UseWaitCursor.

2007-01-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: We can't skip tags if any part of the tag is
	visible.

2007-01-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs: Override OnLayout.

2007-01-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* NotifyIcon.cs: Add ContextMenuStrip and Tag properties.

	* ContextMenuStrip.cs: Make sure context menu is shown on top of 
	everything else.

2007-01-18  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs: remove the partial handling of LBUTTONDOWN
	(leftover from the container_selected days, I'd wager).  fixes bug
	#80546.

2007-01-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Apply patch from George to fix the new testcase on
	bug #80451.  We can't just check for Color.Transparent, we need 
	to check if the back color's alpha channel is < 255.

2007-01-18  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Move setting show_icon = true to before the constructor
	so that the base constructor has that information when it calculates
	the form's size.  Was causing forms to be (6, 6) bigger than they
	were supposed to be.  Thanks for catching this Rolf!

2007-01-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: When replacing a selection we need to invalidate
	from the initial selection start, because selection start is moved
	to the end of the replacement.

2007-01-18  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* LinkLabel.cs: Missing ControlStyles. Fixes #80482

2007-01-18  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs: fix most of the NotWorking unit tests
	I just added.

2007-01-17  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ToolBar.cs: Add layout methods to ToolBarButtonInfo class, every 
	layout methods and properties from ToolBarButton must be available
	into ToolBarButtonInfo.

2007-01-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: If the control has a transparent background, we
	need to refresh it when it moves and when it's parent's background
	image changes.  [Fixes bug #80451]

2007-01-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Don't use 2.0 methods in 1.1 code!  Doh!

2007-01-17  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Implement proper double buffering for Windows.
	[Fixes bug #80447, and probably speeds up things as well]

2007-01-16  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Caption height for MDI children is 19, not 26.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: We need to recalculate NC size after changing 
	window style to toolwindow (otherwise the client rectangle will be
	3 pixels to small for some reason).
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Revert NC size calculations to match how
	they are calculated only based on window styles (to match
	Win32AdjustWindowRectEx, since otherwise when setting size or 
	location, Control will call Win32AdjustWindowRectEx to update client 
	size, which would provoke a paint, then	we'd get a NCCALCSIZE and 
	calculate a different value of client size causing another paint 
	(and flickering))
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: When moving or resizing a window only
	update size or location if they actually changed.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: ManagedWindowsBorderWidth is now 4 instead of 3
	(seems to match Windows behaviour better). Cleaned up 
	ManagedWindowDecorations to draw what's needed and nothing else
	(was drawing borders and lines where they shouldn't be)
	* Hwnd.cs: GetWindowRectangle now knows about MDI border sizes
	(style = 0xFFFF) and takes into account caption height when 
	calculating window rectangle.	

2007-01-16  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ToolBar.cs: Internal ToolBarButtonInfo class added, Because same button 
	can be added to toolbar multiple times, we need to maintain a list of 
	button information for each positions.

2007-01-16  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ToolBar.cs: Some small stetic changes.

2007-01-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Use the new SuspendRecalc/ResumeRecalc methods
	that allow us to have nested recalc = false blocks.
	- Add paste support for images in the RichTextBox
	* RichTextBox.cs: flush the text after the color is changed, so
	the change takes effect.
	- Use SuspendRecalc
	- Some extra debugging info
	* TextControl.cs: Tags no longer track their length, it is just
	computed from the next tags length, this makes things a little
	simpler and reduces places that we have to track length changes.
	- Refactored the linetag class a little so we could make it
	a base class for different kinds of tags
	- Created a image tag, a tag that can have a single image inserted
	into it
	- Replace the norecalc flag with a Suspend/Resume Recalc pair, so
	that we can call suspend multiple times.
	- Add some debugging methods

2007-01-16  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Add ActivatePreviousChild for 
	mdi child window navigation.
	* Form.cs: Use MdiClient.ActivateNextChild/
	ActivatePreviousChild instead of Form.SelectNextControl
	to select the next/previous child since 
	SelectNextControl doesn't do it in the same order
	as mdi children should do it.

2007-01-16  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: remove container_selected field.

2007-01-16  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Update main form's ActiveChild when
	updating keyboard focus for the mdi child.

2007-01-16  Jonathan Pobst  <jpobst@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: PreferredSize fix.

	* Form.cs: Add several 2.0 events, properties, and methods.

2007-01-16  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Form.cs: Provide meaningful message when MdiParent is assigned a
	Form that is not an MdiContainer.

2007-01-16  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Update main form's ActiveChild when
	activating a mdi child.

2007-01-16  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Fix NRE when merging menus and main form
	doesn't have a menu.

	* Form.cs: Request NCRecalc after creating a mdi child window.
	Implement mdi key handling (Ctrl+F4, Ctrl+Shift+F4, Ctrl+Tab, 
	Ctrl+Shift+Tab, Ctrl+F6 and Ctrl+Shift+F6).
	
	* MdiClient.cs: Add new method SendFocusToActiveChild that either
	sends keyboard focus to the active child, or to the MdiClient
	if there are no child forms.
	
2007-01-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ListView.cs: drop the *Internal overrides, just do our work in
	ItemControl's WndProc instead.

	* UpDownBase.cs: a few large changes.  Fix up the Selectable state
	of the various controls, and forward the events properly (in the
	same manner as MS) from the textbox to the UpDown.  Also the
	ActiveControl of the UpDownBase gets set properly now.  Finally,
	we don't call UpdateEditText from the ctor.  Fixes bug #79957.

	* NumericUpDown.cs: set Text in the ctor.

	* DomainUpDown.cs: call UpdateEditText in the ctor.
	
	* TextBox.cs: on ms.net, WM_LBUTTONDOWN sets focus on the textbox,
	so even a Selectable = false textbox can be focused if you click
	in it.  Go figure.

	* Control.cs: remove On{Got,Lost}FocusInternal.  Subclasses can
	just add their handling in their respective WndProc's.  Also add
	an explicit FocusInternal method that doesn't consult CanFocus
	before calling Select(this).

	* TextBoxBase.cs: deal with removal of the FocusInternal calls -
	do our work in WndProc instead.

	* TabControl.cs: same.

	* ComboBox.cs: same.

2007-01-15  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Menu.cs: implement MergeItems and Replace for MenuMerge method.
	Fixes #80006.

2007-01-15 Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs:
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Don't draw the item text outside
	item bounds in Details view, as well as use trimming.
	Fixes bug #80376.

2007-01-15  Jonathan Pobst  <jpobst@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: Implement Form.ShowIcon.
	
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Allow the SetIcon win32 call to set the icon to
	null, which when combined with the DlgModalFrame window style removes
	the icon from the title bar.

2007-01-15  Jonathan Pobst  <jpobst@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Call OnMouseClick after OnClick. (2.0)

2007-01-15  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MdiWindowManager.cs: In CreateMaximizedMenu fix a position of icon
	menu when mdi child windows theres a menu, uses insert to get icon
	at first position. Partially fix #80006.

2007-01-15  Jonathan Pobst  <jpobst@novell.com>

	* Clipboard.cs: Implement 2.0 methods.

2007-01-15  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Menu.cs: Implement Insert method of MenuItemCollection class
	to fix MenuMerge.

2007-01-14  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Implement 2.0 FindItemWithText method.

2007-01-11  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Form.cs: When process WM_NCCALCSIZE message use ClienSize.Width
	to calculate menu bar size. Fixes #80290.

2007-01-11  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Fix position of menuitem check mark.

2007-01-11  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: don't send duplicate WM_ACTIVATE messages to the
	initial form.

2007-01-11  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* LinkLabel.cs: make sure to call base.Select in our Select method
	if it turns out we're going to be selected (i.e. if we have a link
	that is going to receive focus).  That way our container's
	ActiveControl is updated properly.

2007-01-11  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* LinkLabel.cs: turns out that LinkLabels are only Selectable if
	they have 1 or more links.  this fixes the crash gert reported.

2007-01-11  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs: Remove ContainerSelected flag, not needed
	anymore.

	* Control.cs (Controls.Add): Check if control to be added to the collection
	is a top level control, and throw an ArgumentException if it is.
	Remove ContainerSelectedFlag, not needed anymore.

	* XplaUIWin32.cs (SetTopMost): Add flag SWP_NOACTIVATE so that setting the
	top most control doesn't activate the form. This fixes a problem in the
	MessageBox, where the default button wouldn't get focus because the form
	was activated before being Loaded - when the Owner is set, SetTopMost is
	called, and it would activate it.

2007-01-11  Jonathan Pobst  <jpobst@novell.com>

	* Button.cs: When clicked and setting the parent form's DialogResult,
	use FindForm instead of Parent, since parent could be a container
	control and not the Form.  Fixes bug #80495.

2007-01-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: move the call to SendControlFocus into the same
	is_loaded check.

2007-01-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* UpDownBase.cs (.ctor): remove the ActiveControl assignment here.
	It breaks in the face of the new ActiveControl stuff, and should
	be unnecessary.

	* Form.cs (WndProc): in the WM_ACTIVATE case, we need to set the
	activecontrol's focus if it's not already set, after we set
	ActiveControl, but before we call OnActivated.  Re-fixes #79667
	after the previous focus/active control fixes regressed it.

	* Control.cs: reindent some code.
	
2007-01-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Splitter.cs: clearing some outstanding changes from my tree.
	Replace all accesses (not writes) to the internal dock_style field
	with the Dock property.

2007-01-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: make FireEnter, FireLeave, FireValidating, and
	FireValidated virtual.

	* Form.cs: override and don't chain up calls to FireEnter and
	FireLeave.

2007-01-10  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Add more text padding space when using
	auto resize for columns (the previous value didn't work fine).

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Update text position inside columns,
	to match the appeareance of .Net.

	* ColumnHeader.cs: When using auto resize, only the Width should
	depend on the sub items, not the Height. Also, set width after
	auto resizing (the value of Width should never remain as -1 or -2).

2007-01-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Application.cs: fix compilation errors when debug is enabled.

2007-01-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs (set_ActiveControl): rework this a bit (and
	add some nice ascii art pictures and explanation of the process).
	(GetMostDeeplyNestedActiveControl): new utility function we need
	because our ActiveControl can refer to a child container with its
	own ActiveControl.

	* Form.cs (OnActivated): remove the call to SelectActiveControl
	from here, since you can override this method and not chain up,
	and winforms still sets the active control.
	(OnCreateControl): also remove the unnecessary SelectActiveControl
	call from here.
	(WndProc): it's actually called from the WM_ACTIVATE block, just
	before calling OnActivated.

	* Control.cs (Select (Control)): move the call to XplatUI.SetFocus
	inside the else.  the ActiveControl setter will end up setting
	focus on @control.  This keeps us from setting it again (and
	generating an extra LostFocus/GotFocus pair).
	(Select (bool, bool)): reindent.

2007-01-10  Jonathan Pobst  <jpobst@novell.com>

	* FlowLayoutPanel.cs, MenuStrip.cs, SplitContainer.cs, SplitterPanel.cs,
	StatusStrip.cs, TableLayoutPanel.cs, TableLayoutStyleCollection.cs,
	ToolStrip.cs, ToolStripComboBox.cs, ToolStripContainer.cs,
	ToolStripContentPanel.cs, ToolStripControlHost.cs, ToolStripDropDown.cs,
	ToolStripDropDownButton.cs, ToolStripDropDownItem.cs, ToolStripDropDownMenu.cs,
	ToolStripItem.cs, ToolStripMenuItem.cs, ToolStripPanel.cs, ToolStripPanelRow.cs,
	ToolStripSeparator.cs, ToolStripSplitButton.cs, ToolStripStatusLabel.cs
	ToolStripTextBox.cs: Another wave of corcompare work.

2007-01-09  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ColumnHeader.cs: Implement 2.0 AutoResize method using
	the Width property.

	* ListView.cs: Implement 2.0 AutoResizeColumn and AutoResizeColumns
	methods by callling Column.AutoResize method on columns.

2007-01-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Provide proper implementations of PreferredSize
	and GetPreferredSize (2.0).

2007-01-09  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Remove one character (!) to make my previous OnClosing
	stuff work for modal windows like MessageBox.

2007-01-09  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs:
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Use ListView.GetReorderedColumn instead of
	ListView.Columns to get the last displayed column. Fixes #80452.

2007-01-09  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Label.cs, LinkLabel.cs: Source code identation fixes.

2007-01-08  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ToolBarButton.cs: Remove InvalidateBorder and use Invalidate instead,
	we dont need to invalidate only borders because when we invalidate four
	border lines the invalidate's generates a complete redraw of button, 
	because it now invalidate a complete rect some other redraws operations
	are fixed. Fixes #80196.
	
	* Theme.cs, ThemeNice.cs, ThemeClearLooks.cs, ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	Remove ToolBarInvalidateEntireButton as it is not used.

2007-01-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>
	
	* Form.cs: Make sure that both OnClosing and OnFormClosing are
	called for 2.0 profile.
	* CloseReason.cs: Make class internal for 1.1.

2007-01-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripManager.cs: Implement FindToolStrip functionality.
	* ToolStrip.cs: Register and unregister with ToolStripManager.

2007-01-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: This was messy.  2.0 moves much of ControlCollection
	to ArrangedElementCollection.  Implemented this with as few #if's as 
	possible (which is still too many).

2007-01-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Implement SizeFromClientSize() [2.0].

2007-01-07  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Hwnd.cs: On GetClientRectangle add a new parameter border_static,
	use Theme.BorderSize to calculate area instead of static value 1, 
	by the way use new BorderStaticSize instead	Border3DSize when 
	border_static is true. Fixes #79537.
	
	* XplatUIOSX.cs: Fix call to GetClientRectangle. 
	
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: On CPDrawBorder3D dont draw inner border when
	it is not needed.

2007-01-06  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Hwnd.cs: Gives more code legibility to GetWindowRectangle.

2007-01-06  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Label.cs: Override CreateParams to use WS_EX_STATICEDGE instead of
	WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE in ExStyles when BorderStyle is Fixed3D, it is
	
	* Hwnd.cs: 
	- border_static field added, it will used to define when a control 
	theres 3D border but it must be static (thin).
	- In GetWindowRectangle use Theme.BorderSize to calculate area 
	instead of static value 1, by the way use new BorderStaticSize instead
	Border3DSize when border_static is true.

	* XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs: 
	- When WS_EX_STATICEDGE ExStyle is set define border_static as true.
	
	* Theme.cs: BorderStaticSize field added.

2007-01-05  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Removed unused hwnd var in SetBorderStyle.

2007-01-05  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Control.cs: Under InternalBorderStyle call RecreateHangle to 
	mimic same behavior than win32 that set border only in CreateParams,
	it fix problems under CreateParams overrides. Fix #79442 and partial
	fix #79537.
	
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Dont set hwnd.border_style in SetBorderStyle instead
	of thi control you must call recreate handle. 
	
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Remove all SetBorderStyle code, for win32 we dont
	need to do anything as RecreateHangle will take care about borders.

2007-01-05  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: hack to eliminate Lost/Got focus notifications on
	cycles between the ItemControl and parent.  Fixes #80388.

2007-01-05  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Control.cs: Lazy init layout engine. Do not directly use 
	layout_engine since LayoutEngine may be overridden (on 2.0 profile).

2007-01-05  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: don't forceably rebind columns in SetDataSource
	unless our list manager has changed (i.e. unless we have reason to
	believe our columns have changed).  Fixes #80422.
	
	also, disable the call do BindColumns in
	OnListManagerMetaDataChanged.  this breaks this test in 2.0 (in
	1.1 the event isn't raised in response to a column addition on a
	table.)

2007-01-05  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Move LayoutEngine.Layout to the OnLayout method, so
	that inheritors can not call it if they choose.  Fixes bug #80456.

2007-01-05  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Initialize MSG.refobject at 0 so it 
	doesn't blow up with a null exception on marshalling.
	
2007-01-05  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Implement several 2.0 protected properties and methods.
	Ensure that all necessary events are being called when properties
	are set.

2007-01-05  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: implement PgUp/PgDn for Details view.  Also
	fixes First/LastVisibleIndex to use the item_control.ClientRect 
	instead of the parent control.  Fixes #80378.

2006-01-05  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* PageSetupDialog.cs : cosmetic refactoring; use RegionInfo to
	  determine whether to use yard-pound or not (bug #78399).

2006-01-04  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Sebastien fixed the libgdiplus png alpha
	problems. So it is time to bring back the old popupbutton colors.

2006-01-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ColumnHeader.cs:
	* ListView.cs: Implement 2.0 ColumnHeader.DisplayIndex
	property by using the internal information of the
	columns order in ListView.

2007-01-04  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* CommonDialog.cs, Cursor.cs, ErrorProvider.cs, HelpProvider.cs:
	Add 2.0 Tag properties.

	* LinkArea.cs: Add 2.0 ToString method.

2007-01-03  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: the Alt+0 handling was wrong, it should have been
	Ctrl+0.  Fixes bug #80367.  Also, don't eat the Delete keypress
	when we're editing, which fixes #80047.

2007-01-03  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: apply patch contributed by Dominik Seichter.  fixes
	#80404.

2007-01-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* MenuStrip.cs, ToolStripMenuItem.cs: Add MdiWindowListItem
	property and implementation.

	* Form.cs, MdiClient.cs, MdiWindowManager.cs: Add needed hooks
	for MdiWindowListItem property.

	* ToolStripDropDown.cs: Don't consider hidden menu items while
	laying out the menu.

2007-01-03  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* SendKeys.cs: window handle is not needed in win32, so just
	get the active window for X after parsing keys and don't use
	it when building the message; it is passed by parameter to the 
	Xplat method and used there to build the message instead. Also,
	wait for events to be processed on SendWait, as opposed to Send,
	which doesn't wait :) Playing with threads and Send() completely 
	hangs on ms.net, only SendWait() works.
	
	XplatUIX11.cs
	X11Display.cs: Check for valid window handle.

2007-01-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Need to prevent wrap calculations when replacing
	text (this was there before i removed it accidently).
	- Don't update the cursor during the positioning, just set it to
	selection_start at the end of the operaion.

2007-01-03  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Control.cs:
	* NotifyIcon.cs: corcompare work, no more X's in 1.1 class status.
	
2007-01-03  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: Added Click and DoubleClick events again,
	but this time they only hide Control's Click and DoubleClick.
	
2007-01-03  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Theme.cs: Re-enabled DefaultFont change. Use const to refer to
	System.Drawing assembly. Spaces to tabs. Removed extra tabs.

2007-01-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: We move the caret with the split now, so we
	don't need to explicitly move the caret after splitting.  This
	fixes the caret bumping down an extra line on Enter.

2007-01-02  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs: Add AutoValidateChanged event (for PDN
	2.72). 

	* ScrollableControl.cs: Add Scroll event.

2007-01-02  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: one more try with help from georgegiolfan@yahoo.com 
	to fix all hdr height padding codepaths.  Fixes #80207.

2007-01-02  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* StatusBar.cs (.ctor): remove the Anchor setting, as it's just
	setting it to the Control defaults anyway, and it being after the
	Dock set was screwing up layout.
	(set_Dock): don't short circuit out of setting base.Dock.  Also,
	no need to call UpdateStatusBar here, as it'll be re-layed out if
	it needs to be.

2007-01-02  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: patch from georgegiolfan@yahoo.com to add padding
	to header height for width == -1. Fixes the rest of #80207.

2007-01-02  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: rework the mouse event forwarding everaldo added
	to translate the coordinates to the parent control not
	raise the parent events until after we've done our work. Hover
	needs more work, in the case where HoverSelection is on, because
	the item control receives more than one MouseHover per Enter
	event, so we need to ensure only the "first" hover gets forwarded.
	Opening a minor bug for that.

2007-01-02  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* CheckedListBox.cs: Fixed SelectionMode to match MS.
	* ListControl.cs: Implemented AllowSelection property. Removed extra
	tabs.
	* ListBox.cs: Implemented AllowSelection property.

2007-01-02  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuItem.cs: In MdiWindowClickHandler uses sender instead of
	SelectedItem, it prevent for errors when you must disable item
	before perform click. Fixes #80409.

2007-01-02  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Prevent second level and beyond submenus to close
	until first level when move out side of popup.
	
2007-01-02  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs:
	- Down submenu positin in three pixels.
	- Closes sub menu when mouse leaves from menu. Fixes #80402.

2007-01-02  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	- Fix popup menu size adding one pixel on the top.
	- Down menu item border from two to one to mimic Win32.
	- Some source identation fixes. 

2007-01-01  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Use float numbers to calculate size and
	position of menu arrows, it fix wrong arrow size.

2007-01-01  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Uses CPDrawBorder3D to draw menu borders
	instead of line, it simplify draw operation and fix it using 3D
	borders to mimic Win32.

2007-01-01  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* StatusStrip.cs: Add implementation of the sizing grip.

	* ToolStripRenderer.cs, ToolStripProfessionalRenderer.cs: Add
	StatusStrip rendering.

2006-12-31  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ToolBar.cs: don't assign to dock_style in the .ctor.  it doesn't
	override the layout style (anchor/dock) of the control.  assign to
	Dock instead.  Fixes bug #80416.

	* ToolStrip.cs: same.

2006-12-31  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs: Use ContainerSelected flag to check if 
	a Container is directly selected, or if Select is called on a 
	non-container. If a container is directly selected, focus events 
	should not be raised.
	Apply #80411 patch to throw exception on set_ActiveControl if 
	control is the same as the current one.
	
	* Control.cs: Use ContainerSelected flag (see above).
	Add invalidation check to raise event but not invalidate if 
	dimensions are 0.	
	Apply #80411 patch.
	

2006-12-31  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs: After click, dont close popup menu when menu is
	ContextMenu. Fixes #80399.

2006-12-30  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs: make sure we throw the exception if the
	container control doesn't contain the control we're setting
	ActiveControl to.

2006-12-30  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (SetTopLevel): fix the exception raised by
	SetTopLevel for child controls.
	(set_Anchor): call UpdateDistances when setting the anchor type.
	This fixes bug #80336.

2006-12-29  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Theme.cs: For now, revert back to 8pt font.

2006-12-29  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Set popup as active when open a ContextMenu. 
	Fixes #80395.

2006-12-29  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: reorder the code in OnResize to give the same event
	ordering as MS.

2006-12-29  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Implemented MdiLayout for ArrangeIcons,
	TileHorizontally and TileVertically.
	
2006-12-29  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ColorDialog.cs, FileDialog.cs, FolderBrowserDialog.cs,
	FontDialog.cs, Mime.cs, MimeIcon.cs, OpenFileDialog.cs,
	SaveFileDialog.cs, ThemeClearlooks.cs, ThemeNics.cs:
	Corrected copyright and email adress.

2006-12-29  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TreeNode.cs: On 2.0 profile, throw InvalidOperationException instead
	of Exception in FullPath property if no TreeView is associated with
	the TreeNode.

2006-12-29  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Theme.cs: Marked default_font as private, and initialize it in ctor
	with MS Sans Sarif 8.25 on 1.0 profile, and SystemFonts.DefaultFont
	on 2.0 profile.
	* ThemeGtk.cs: Removed default_font intialization.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Removed default_font initialization.

2006-12-28  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: fix a couple of place where we were creating handles
	more aggressively than we should be.  Fixes ControlRefresh unit
	tests.

2006-12-28  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: contrary to what the comment said, Control.Dock does
	not supercede Control.Anchor - the last one you assign to decides
	the layout behavior.  so we need to keep track of which was the
	last set.  Also, fix some of the affected property arguments in
	PerformLayout calls, and remove an redundant parent.PerformLayout
	call in OnResized.

	Add a VisibleInternal property, which returns is_visible.  We
	can/should get rid of all the usage of this field elsewhere.

2006-12-28  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>
	
	* Control.cs: DoubleBuffered property reflects the OptimizedDoubleBuffer
	control style, not DoubleBuffer. Added UseDoubleBuffering property
	that indicates whether doublebuffering is enabled and supported.
	(comment from and code based on Gert Driesen's patch in #80324).
	Fixes #80324.

2006-12-28  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>
	
	* Control.cs: Fixed a NRE.

2006-12-28  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* TrackBar.cs: Fix SmallChange and LargeChange exceptions
	for 2.0.

2006-12-28  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Rewrote double buffering, now a seperate
	class handles all the buffering, no Graphics is disposed of
	until the painting is finished (earlier implementation 
	would crash if the control was resized in the OnPaint, 
	since it would cause the double buffer to be recreated
	and the old one disposed), a separate Graphics is 
	created for every paint (MS behaviour and anyways the state
	of the Graphics would have to be saved and restored otherwise)
	
	* XplatUIDriver.cs: 
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	* XplatUI.cs: Added and implemented GetOffscreenGraphics 
	so that we can get the graphics for the back buffer without
	having to create a new one and remove the offscreen_dc parameter
	from CreateOffscreenDrawable and DestroyOffscreenDrawable.
	
2006-12-27  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Add key-related 2.0 methods for CheckedItemCollection.
	Also make virtual all the key-related methods.

	* ListViewItem.cs: Make virtual the key related methods for
	ListViewSubItemCollection.

2006-12-27  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs:
	* ListViewItem.cs:
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	* Theme.cs: Initial support for Tile view in ListView,
	as well as the implementation of the required bits for it (Item
	and Subitem).

2006-12-27  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: On 2.0, throw ArgumentOutOfRangeException instead
	of ArgumentException in MaxSelectionCount, MaxDate and MinDate.
	Provide useful exception messages.

2006-12-27  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* TrackBar.cs: Remove a warning.
	* MonthCalendar.cs: Moved back to using Capture to hide the calendar
	when used by DateTimePicker, fixes #80287. This also requires that 
	MonthCalendar implements it's own drawing for the yearly updown control,
	otherwise the Capture tracking would be too complicated. Removed the Click 
	and DoubleClick events (according to comments they were hiding the base class
	event to prevent them from beeing fired - MSDN only says MonthCalendar doesn't
	raise these events, not that they cannot be raised. It is possible to raise 
	them by calling OnClick and OnDoubleClick). Added two internal fields in 
	HitTestInfo in order to track give more tracking info needed by MonthCalendar.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Implement drawing of MonthCalendar's updown part.
	* DateTimePicker.cs: Removed handling of MonthCalendar's LostFocus
	event, no longer needed.
	
2006-12-27  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	item to ListView. Fixes #80367.

2006-12-26  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ComboBox.cs: On 2.0, DropDownWidth throws ArgumentOutOfRangeException
	if value is less than one. ItemHeight should not be set to a value
	less than 1, and throw ArgumentOutOfRangeException on 2.0 profile. 
	Removed extra tabs.

2006-12-26  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripMenuItem.cs: Add ShortcutDisplayString for Moma.

2006-12-25  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: only update dist_right/dist_bottom if the
	width/height is > 0.  this fixes anchored controls being resized
	smaller until they disappear and then resized larger again.

2006-12-25  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: a couple of changes.  Remove dist_left and dist_top,
	since they're nothing more than X/Left and Y/Top, respectively.

	Also, move back to a per-control Bitmap/Graphics for
	DeviceContext, since using the static Hwnd.bmp/bmp_g is bad in the
	MT case.  Go with a tiny bitmap though, 1x1, instead of Width x
	Height.

2006-12-25  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* MessageBox.cs: Implemented overload that takes a new "bool
	displayHelpButton" by adding a new internal field "show_help".
	When clicked this will raise the HelpRequested on the owner or the
	main form. 

	From: 007dbe3ff0ca4729a4f5fcd1d8ab2a2e.txt
	From: c935e12b95fe4dc1ae670e7f4dc5fd68.txt

	* ListView.cs: Add support ColumnWidthChanged and
	ColumnWidthChanging. 

	Add support for ColumnReordered event.
	(ReorderColumn): Add NET_2_0 specific support for cancelling the
	reorder.

	Very nice codebase!

	* TextBoxBase.cs (GetLineFromCharIndex): Implement this method.

	This is used by report f4ae0a88a0a244558aaadf017c9b9efe.

2006-12-24  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* GridTablesFactory.cs: 2.0 corcompare work.

	* DataGridView.cs: PaddingChanged is overridden.

2006-12-24  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: corecompare work here too.

	* DataGridViewElement.cs, DataGridView.cs,
	DataGridViewButtonCell.cs, DataGridViewRowCollection.cs,
	DataGridViewImageColumn.cs, DataGridViewComboBoxColumn.cs,
	DataGridViewImageCell.cs, DataGridViewCheckBoxCell.cs,
	DataGridViewHeaderCell.cs, DataGridViewCell.cs: more corcompare
	work.

2006-12-24  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Switched the error message on the console for a
	todo.  A review of the code will have to cope with this anyways
	(since its a large feature, it is in our radar) and it was
	producing too much output when running PDN.

	* ToolStripComboBox.cs: Set the text when the SelectedIndex
	changes.  Applications depend on this (PDN 2.72)

2006-12-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* TableLayoutSettings.cs: finish up the corcompare work for this
	class.

2006-12-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: make SetImplicitBounds internal, do some futzing
	with LayoutEngine so that it's available in 1.1, and remove the
	entire duplicated code mess from PerformLayout.  Use
	System.Windows.Forms.Layout.DefaultLayout instead.

	* LayoutEngine.cs: make this class internal in 1.1, public in 2.0.

2006-12-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Add MainMenuStrip property.

2006-12-23  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

2006-12-23  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs: When hides menu set Wnd to null, it prevents
	FindSubItemByCoord to found itens that is not active, also an
	cheking added to FindSubItemByCoord to search for items only 
	in visible popup windows. Fixes #80274.

2006-12-22  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* UserControl.cs: Remove MonoTodo and use InternalBorderStyle,
	internal property, it be care about change ExStyle. 

2006-12-22  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs: set activeControl for parent forms up the 
	tree when the new activecontrol is a container.
	When validating the active control, if it is a container, also
	raise up the validation for it's active control. Fixes #80280
	
	* Control.cs: Add internal property flag and check to prevent
	Focus events from getting raised when Select() is called for
	a ContainerControl. There are still too many focus events being
	raised at the moment though.
	Cleaned up the code a bit.

2006-12-22  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Added all missing 2.0 events.and

	SplitterPanel.cs: corecompare work.

2006-12-21  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripContainer.cs, ToolStripDropDown.cs, StatusStrip.cs:
	Clean up warnings for BackgroundImageChanged and PaddingChanged
	events now that they are implemented in Control.cs.

2006-12-21  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Make sure layout_engine isn't null before using it (2.0).
	
	* TableLayoutControlCollection.cs, TableLayoutPanel.cs, TableLayoutCellPosition.cs,
	TableLayoutSettings.cs, TableLayoutStyleCollection.cs: Initial implementation
	of TableLayoutPanel and supporting cast.

2006-12-21  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: 
	- GrabWindow now confines the mouse pointer to the confine window.
	- Added Win32ClipCursor and Win32GetClipCursor.

	* Control.cs: 
	- Added CaptureWithConfine to be able to capture and confine 
	mouse pointer.
	
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: 
	- Call CaptureWithConfine instead of Capture if we're an
	MdiChild (fixes #79982).

2006-12-21  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: guard against the initial state of selection, where
	selection_start == -1.  make sure we only select from index >= 0.
	Fixes bug #80291.

2006-12-21  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: we don't need to be so draconian with
	UpdateDistances, and we thusly don't need to call it before
	calling PerformLayout in ResumeLayout.  Fixes bug #80289.

2006-12-21  Daniel Nauck  <dna@mono-project.de>

	* ComboBox.cs,
	TextBox.cs: Implemented AutoComplete properties.

2006-12-20  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridView*.cs: some corecompare work.

2006-12-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: We need to hide the caret when deleting it,
	otherwise you get carets left lying around everywhere.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Kill then redraw the caret when scrolling.  This
	prevents getting some weird half drawn caret tracers when
	scrolling.
	* TextControl.cs: Attempt to reduce the number of times we need to
	recreate the caret.

2006-12-20  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: Fixed previous month button. Removed extra tabs.

2006-12-19  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* DateTimePicker.cs:
	- Implemented missing 2.0 bits.
	- Changed some default values to match MS.
	
2006-12-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: When changing the font across the document we
	can't recalculate after changing each line, since that will cahnge
	the line count.
	- PreferredHeight is a little different than i thought.
	- When backspacing, move the caret before we do the actual char
	delete, because when that delete crosses a wrap boundary the
	positional information will change.

2006-12-19  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Added some missing 2.0 bits: 
	BackgroundImageLayout, BackgroundImageLayoutChanged, 
	OnPaddingChanged, MouseClick, MouseDoubleClick, PaddingChanged and 
	add IBindableComponent and IDropTarget implementation.
	
	* MonthCalendar.cs: 
	- Added all missing 2.0 features:
	BackgroundImageLayout, RightToLeftLayout, 
	OnHandleDestroyed, RightToLeftLayoutChanged, 
	BackgroundImageLayoutChanged, MouseClick, MouseDoubleClick,
	PaddingChanged.
	- Rewrote all the BoldDate code, it was completely broken.
	- Fixed all the tests (the tests can now be re-enabled, the
	problems were not with the tests, but with the control, it was
	mostly broken).
	
	* DateTimePicker.cs: Changed the location where the 
	MonthCalendar is shown.
	
2006-12-19  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridView.cs: add IDropTarget implementation.

	* ToolStripPanel.cs: add IDropTarget implementation.

2006-12-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: soft now means something different than what it
	used to mean, we want to move the caret regardless of whether or
	not this break was soft (would we really have wanted the caret
	to not move with the break in the old context?)
	* TreeView.cs: Make sure we factor in the vert scrollbar when
	calculating the horizontal scrollbar's maximum.

2006-12-19  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.org>

	* SendKeys.cs: Fix Send() behaviour, clear keys after sending,
	check for keywords in alternate casing, close bug #80049.

2006-12-19  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ToolStripItem.cs: add the implementation of the 4 IDropTarget
	methods (which all do nothing).

	* IDropTarget.cs: add the 4 missing methods.

2006-12-19  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* TableLayoutRowStyleCollection.cs: corcompare work.
	
	* TableLayoutSettings.cs: same.

	* TableLayoutStyle.cs: same.

	* TableLayoutColumnStyleCollection.cs: same.

2006-12-19  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ColumnStyle.cs, RowStyle.cs, TableLayoutStyle.cs: Plumbing for
	TableLayoutPanel I've had in my local tree for way too long.

2006-12-19  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* TableLayoutSettings.cs: Finish the public API (still needs all
	the logic to update on changes). 

	* TableLayoutPanelCellPosition.cs: new file.
	
	* TableLayoutRowStyleCollection.cs,
	TableLayoutColumnStyleCollection, TableLayoutStyle.cs,
	TableLayoutSettings.cs: Track the final 2.0 table api.

2006-12-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ColumnHeader.cs: Add Tag, Name, ImageKey, ImageIndex,
	and Image List 2.0 members for ColummnHeader.
	* ListView.cs: Add key-related 2.0 methods for
	ColumnHeaderCollection.

2006-12-19  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ListViewItem.cs: Changed AddRange overloads to match MS: throw
	ArgumentNullException if items argument is null. Ignore null item in
	arrays. Removed extra tabs.

2006-12-19  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: Fixed InvalidCastException.

2006-12-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Don't increment the position here.
	- When calculating char positions only add in the line break size
	for hard line breaks.

2006-12-19  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.org>

	* SendKeys.cs: Changed some things to match ms.net behaviour
	when parsing shifted capital letters.
	
	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIWin32, XplatUIOSX: 
	Add window handle as parameter to SendInput. X11 needs the 
	window handle, and the handle being passed	to it in the keys 
	queue is the active control handle (which windows needs), not 
	the window handle.
	
	XplatUIX11.cs, XplaUIX11-new.cs, X11Display: Implement SendInput 
	to support SendKeys on X.	
	
	* X11Keyboard: Implement helper method to lookup a linux keycode
	given the virtual keycode. Added table of keycode-2-virtualkey
	values to support this.

2006-12-19  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Add support for SelectedIndexCollection
	and SelectedItemCollection 2.0 methods. Implement support
	for ImageKey too.
	* ListViewItem.cs: Add support for ListViewSubItemCollection
	2.0 methods. Also, fix an incorrect behavior of AddRange method
	(it shouldn't call Clear).
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Support for ListView.ImageKey 2.0 property.

2006-12-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: 
	* TextBoxBase.cs: New args for FormatText
	* TextControl.cs: Rewrote the main drawing method, this version
	feels a little easier to understand and debug to me.  Hopefully it
	does to others also
	- Fix FormatText to OR in the new formating values.  Added
	FormatSpecified param, basically this works in the same way as
	BoundsSpecified in Control.
	- Set the caret properties when the caret is positioned.
	- When wrapping text make sure that we calculate the width of the
	last character
	- when calculating alignments we might have wrapped down to the
	next line, so don't search for an individual tag, search for the
	end of the line
	- We need to invalidate the selection area when we replace the
	selection.
	
2006-12-19  Daniel Nauck  <dna@mono-project.de>

	* Application.cs: add Restart () 2.0 support

2006-12-18  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	property. Fixes #80268.
	
2006-12-18  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	item. Fixes #80270.

2006-12-18  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs: When you click on menuitem only trigger onselect
	event for top menu itens. Fixes #80271.
	
2006-12-18  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Make IconicBounds depend on
	the bottom of MdiClient, not the top (fixes #80267)
	
2006-12-18  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Added missing 2.0 attribute

2006-12-18  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: Add Name and Tag 2.0 properties, as well
	as IndexOfKey, ContainsKey, RemoveByKey and indexer 2.0.

2006-12-18  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Fix click when menuitem is not popup,
	this regression was caused by last commit (#80272).

2006-12-17  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs: When a non-toplevel menuitem is clicked dont
	fire click event or close menu. Fixes #80272.

2006-12-17  Daniel Nauck  <dna@mono-project.de>

	* ListViewHitTestInfo.cs: add

2006-12-17  Daniel Nauck  <dna@mono-project.de>

	* ButtonBase.cs: Added FlatButtonAppearance 2.0 support.
	* FlatButtonAppearance.cs: add
	* DockingAttribute.cs: add

2006-12-17  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: hook up MetaDataChanged event on the list manager,
	and rebind our columns when it does - this way, if you make
	changes to the DataTable (or set the Table attribute on a DataView
	after setting it as the DataGrid's DataSource, the changes are
	made visible.)  Fixes bug #80107.

2006-12-17  Daniel Nauck  <dna@mono-project.de>

	* ListViewGroup.cs: add internal Location property for layouting.
	* Theme.cs: add abstract ListViewGroupHeight function.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: implement ListViewGroupHeight function.

2006-12-16  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Fixed checks for NET_2_0-specific exceptions.
	Added reset of selected index to 0 when adding first tab page.
	Fixes #80264
	
	* NumericUpDown.cs: Fix NET_2_0 check

2006-12-16  Daniel Nauck  <dna@mono-project.de>

	* ListViewGroup.cs: fixed DefaultValueAttribute value

2006-12-16  Daniel Nauck  <dna@mono-project.de>

	* AutoCompleteStringCollection.cs: add new AutoCompleteStringCollection 2.0 class

2006-12-15  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	TextBoxBase.cs, ListView.cs, ContainerControl.cs,
	ScrollableControl.cs: Add a handful of methods that are
	overwritten in 2.0 

2006-12-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: initial implementation of the Reversible
	drawing functions.  there are some problems.  DrawReversibleFrame
	doesn't seem to work at all for Dashed FrameStyle, and in the
	Thick case there are drawing errors at the corners (we probably
	need to bind Rectangle instead of doing moveto/lineto's.)

2006-12-16  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>
	
	* SendKeys.cs: Implemented. SendKeys uses a new method in XPlatUI, SendInput, 
	to send blocks of key messages. Send accumulates keys to send with Flush, 
	while SendWait sends all keys immediately.
		
	* XplaUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs, 
	XplatUIX11.cs,	XplatUIX11-new.cs:
	- Define SendInput and stubs for OSX and X11, implements Win32 with a call
	to Win32 SendInput.
	- Added INPUT support structures to XplatUIWin32 for Win32SendInput
	
	Tests: 	It seems ms.net is hooking the keyboard to implement this, so doing unit
	testing for ms.net on this class is very tricky, as the tests run too fast 
	to allow the hook to release, essentially freezing the keyboard and the 
	test. So, barring a win32 miracle, they'll be commited in the ms-notworking	
	category :p

2006-12-16  Daniel Nauck  <dna@mono-project.de>

	* Padding.cs: fixed serialization compability to MS ("_var" field names),
			added missing attributes.
 
2006-12-15  Daniel Nauck  <dna@mono-project.de>

2006-12-15  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>
	
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Fix a NullRef with previous 
	changes for toolwindows.
	
2006-12-15  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: 
	- Added AfterTopMostControl to allow for certain controls 
	to always stay on top when normal controls are brought to 
	front.
	
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: 
	- (DrawInversibleRectangle): Get window rectangle from Win32 
	in stead of from control, since Win32 doesn't calculate
	screen coords correctly from control's Location if it 
	have docked siblings.
	
	* MdiWindowManager.cs:
	- Correct the control menu popup location when clicked on
	the maximized form icon. (fixes #80223.1)
	- Don't show moving rectangle if mouse hasn't moved from
	the original clicked point.
	- Removed FormGotFocus handler (not used).
	- Calculate the control buttons location from the main
	window's size and not client size (fixes #79770).
	- Form is now closed when the form icon is double-clicked
	(fixes #79775).	
	- Correct NCCalcSize numbers a little bit (fixes #80223.2)
	
	* InternalWindowManager.cs:
	- Moved some MDI-only methods to MdiWindowManager.
	- Removed unused properties and methods.
	- Unified method naming for methods handling wm messages.
	- Moved all message handling to seperate methods for
	each message.
	
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	- DrawManagedWindowDecorations now draws the title bar 
	with a gradient brush.
	- Add a CPDrawButtonInternal that allows us to specify
	light, normal and dark colors for the buttons (control 
	buttons for MDI children were drawn with the same light
	color as the background, therefore loosing the 3D effect).
	
	* SizeGrip.cs:
	- Add a CapturedControl property that is used to 
	determine the control to resize (defaults to parent). 
	Needed for MdiClient, since its SizeGrip's parent is
	MdiClient, but the control to resize is the main form.
	
	* MdiClient.cs:
	- Set SizeGrip's CapturedControl to the main form in order
	to resize the main form and not the MdiClient.
	- Override AfterTopMostControl to leave the scrollbars 
	always on top.

	of width -2.  Fixes #80207.
 
2006-12-14  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	logic.  Fixes #80250.

2006-12-14  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: throw ArgumentExceptions when parented ListViewItems
	are added or inserted to the collection.  Fixes #81099.

2006-12-13  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ListViewItem.cs: Fix dumb error.

	* ListView.cs: Add Find and ContainsKey methods in 
	ListViewItemCollection, and also return true for IsReadOnly
	and IsFixedSize (changes for 2.0). 

2006-12-13  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Control.cs: Allow Region to be set to null.

2006-12-13  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Remove unused (commented out) code.
	* Form.cs: When the MdiChild is maximized, the form needs 
	WM_NCMOUSELEAVE, so request it.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: 
	- Added tooltips to control buttons.
	- Removed duplicated control button handling code.
	- Removed unused (commented out) code.
	
2006-12-12  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Set cursor to default in popup menus, a XplatUI.SetCursor 
	was used because we must set cursor without trigger ChangeCursor event
	and without change Cursor control property. Fixes #79963.

2006-12-12  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>
	
	* Control.cs: Check if Region setter value is null, and ignore

2006-12-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: We were almost always drawing one more line then
	needed, since the GetLineByPixel will return the last line found
	at that pixel. In most cases though, we were invalidating up to
	the junction between two lines.
	- Improve debug code.

2006-12-12  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUI.cs: add static DrawReversibleFrame, DrawReversibleLine,
	and FillReversibleRectangle.

	* XplatUIDriver.cs: add abstract DrawReversibleFrame, DrawReversibleLine,
	and FillReversibleRectangle.

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: add stubs which do nothing for
	DrawReversibleFrame, DrawReversibleLine, and
	FillReversibleRectangle.

	* XplatUIOSX.cs: add stubs which raise NIE for
	DrawReversibleFrame, DrawReversibleLine, and
	FillReversibleRectangle.

	* XplatUIX11.cs: add working implementation for
	DrawReversibleFrame, DrawReversibleLine, and
	FillReversibleRectangle.
	
	* ControlPaint.cs: implement DrawReversibleFrame,
	DrawReversibleLine, and FillReversibleRectangle, by calling into
	the appropriate XplatUI method.

2006-12-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: Make MdiClient have the focus even if it's
	not selectable, since it should receive WM_KEY* and WM_MOUSE 
	messages. Fixes #79907.
	
2006-12-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Hwnd.cs: Save the CreateParams.ExStyle so that it can be
	queried after the window is created.
	
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Added SendParentNotify to implement 
	WM_PARENTNOTIFY logic. Fixes #79965.
	
	* Control.cs: Added MakeParam.
	
2006-12-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	states (fixes #80201).

2006-12-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	the click (fixes #80197).

2006-12-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: We need to cap this value, since Maximum -
	ViewPortHeight can be less than zero.
	- Only do selection with the left mouse button.
	* TextBox.cs: Don't tell the world that we have a context menu.
	* Control.cs: New method so that we can control whether or not the
	context menu is visible outside MWF.

2006-12-11  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ToolBarButton.cs: Fix text positon. 

2006-12-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* ProgressBar.cs (MarqueeAnimationSpeed): Add stub.

	* Control.cs (DoubleBuffered): Add implementation.

	* Application.cs (OpenForms): Add.

2006-12-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Use opacity instead of Opactiy to determine if we need
	to set the WS_EX_LAYERED bit.  [Fixes bug #80185]

2006-12-11  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Fix NRE if Control.Site was set to null.

2006-12-11  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: ControlCollection.Remove should return if the arg is
	null, and ControlCollection.SetChildIndex should raise a ANE.

2006-12-11  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Control.cs: Verify value set for Dock property. Code formatting
	updates.

2006-12-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Draw the caret and the selection when a flag is
	set on the owner.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: We want to draw the caret and the selection for
	TextBox but not for TextBoxBase.
	- If the window is resized and scrolling is no longer needed (the
	whole doc is visible) set the scroll position to zero.
	- The default SelectWord (the one TextBox uses) should move the
	caret to the end of the word.
	- SelectAll moves the caret to the end of the selection.
	* TextBox.cs: We don't selectall on focus, we just do it when the
	control is created.
	
2006-12-11  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: stub in a 2.0 override for ProcessKeyEventArgs.

2006-12-11  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Add Insert, IndexOfKey, RemoveByKey and indexer 
	2.0 support.
	* ListViewItem.cs: Add Name 2.0 property.

2006-12-11  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Set visibility on selected or default tab 
	when tabcontrol handle is created, so that it's contents
	actually show up (duh). Fixes #80193
	Don't redraw the control if there is no handle created, as
	the selected index might be completely invalid. Added some tests
	to check for this.

2006-12-11  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ToolBar.cs: Uses maximun width and height of all buttons as 
	button rectangle when ButtonSize specified, it looks strange but
	is what happens in Win32. Fixes #80189.

2006-12-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Need to track undo levels ourself, since
	compound actions will mess them up.

2006-12-10  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Raise SelectedIndexChanged for 1.1 if the
	SelectedIndex value is changed (even if it's not valid).
	Reset SelectedIndex to 0 when the handle is created and if
	the current index is invalid.
	Fixes SelectdeIndex unit tests and #80128

2006-12-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs (set_CurrentCell): because EnsureCellVisibility
	calls EndEdit, it needs to be called before we set current_cell to
	its new value.  Otherwise, we end up committing the value in the
	textbox to the new cell as well.  Fixes bug #80160.

2006-12-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs (set_CancelButton): if the button's DialogResult is
	None, set it to Cancel.  Fixes bug 80180.

2006-12-08  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Ugh, ClientSize can be 0,0 sometimes, so we need
	to watch ourselves when setting the canvas size and setting the
	scrollbar values.

2006-12-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: comment out the two MakeTransparent calls for the
	time being so people using trunk (and not 1.2.2) on windows can
	actually use the datagrid.  This deals with bug #80151.

2006-12-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Change ButtonBase_DrawImage to use the
	Graphics.DrawImage (image, int, int, int, int) overload instead
	of Graphics.DrawImage (image, int, int).  GDI+ can't figure out
	the dpi difference and was blurring images it drew.
	[Fixes bug #79960]

2006-12-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs (DataGridPaintRows): handle case where
	rowcnt is 0 (such as with an empty datasource), and make sure we
	initialize not_usedarea.Y to cells.Y, so we don't draw over the
	other areas (caption, parent row, etc, etc).  Fixes bug #80095.

2006-12-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs (SetDataGrid): don't try to access a null
	grid.

2006-12-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	[ Fixes bug #80167 ]
	
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: don't draw the image if the button's flat
	style is FlatStyle.System.

	* ButtonBase, ThemeClearlooks.cs, ThemeGtk.cs, ThemeNice.cs: make
	ButtonBase.flat_style private, and switch uses of it to the public
	property.
	
2006-12-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	[ Fixes bug #80121 ]
	
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: center the caption text in the datagrid
	when we draw it.

	* DataGrid.cs: lessen the amount we add to the caption height from
	6 to 2.  6 was making it huge.

2006-12-08  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* UpDownBase: Handle MouseWheel call directly instead of capturing
	the inner textbox's OnMouseWheel. Fixes #80166

2006-12-08  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: We need to invalidate the textbox when we empty
	it (how had this not been discovered before?)

2006-12-08  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Reworked the mouse down code so I could get it
	to behave like MS, we now ignore the eventargs.Click and just
	track state ourself, which we were already doing anyways.
	- Constrain the double click handler to the double click size.
	
2006-12-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: the mousewheel code shouldn't try to scroll in a
	direction if that scrollbar isn't shown.  fixes bug #80158.

2006-12-08  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* NumericUpDown.cs: Update value on getter. Fixes #79950

2006-12-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* MenuItem.cs: add back in the event cloning code.  I didn't know
	how to do it in the face of the EventHandlerList work i'd done
	last week.  Fixes bug #80183.

2006-12-08  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Add an invalidate to the BackgroundImage setter.
	[Fixes 80184]

2006-12-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip*: Add some small properties reported by MoMA, fix event
	firing and default properties based off of unit tests, and add some
	attributes based off of the class status page.

2006-12-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Take HideSelection into account when determining
	whether or not to show the selection.
	* RichTextBox.cs: After inserting the RTF into the document move
	the cursor to the beginning of the document.

2006-12-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Remove static ArrayList "controls" which maintained
	a reference to every control created.
	* Application.cs: Create a static FormCollection to maintain a reference
	to every form created.  Use it in places that formerly enumerated through
	the controls one looking for forms.
	* Form.cs: Add and remove self from above FormCollection.

2006-12-07  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: gdk_pixbuf_save_to_buffer is part of libgdk-pixbuf,
	  not libgdk (though it makes me wonder why I didn't have any
	  problems)

2006-12-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	[ you had to know this was coming after that last commit...]
	
	* XplatUIX11.cs: implement the 3 Offscreen functions in terms of
	XPixmaps (CreateOffscreenDrawable maps to XCreatePixmap,
	DestroyOffscreenDrawable to FreePixmap, and BlitFromOffscreen to
	XCopyArea).

2006-12-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUI.cs: add 3 calls (CreateOffscreenDrawable,
	DestroyOffscreenDrawable, and BlitFromOffscreen) that encompass
	all the behavior we need for double buffering.

	* XplatUIDriver.cs: implement the 3 double buffer methods using a
	client side Bitmap, just like the old Control-based double buffer
	code did.  The methods are virtual, so each XplatUI driver
	subclass can replace the implementation to use a faster, platform
	specific approach.

	* Control.cs: make use of the 3 Offscreen XplatUI calls in the
	double buffer code, and clean things up a bit in the process.

2006-12-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: reindent WndProc.

2006-12-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	[ I wanna be like BenM when I grow up ]
	
	* Hwnd.cs: create a single static Graphics object on the static
	Bitmap we create.  use this for our text measurements.

	* Control.cs (DeviceContext): stop using the backbuffer's dc_mem.
	This was causing us to allocate a backbuffer for every control,
	even when it wasn't flagged as double buffered.  Instead use the
	single graphics instance.  This might have implications for
	multithreaded applications.  If we run into problems we can switch
	to creating 1 Graphics per control, on the static Hwnd bitmap.

	this change nets us a 7M savings in private dirty mappings when
	running FormsTest.exe.

2006-12-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ListView.cs: the BackgroundImage override is just to set
	attributes.  chain up to base.BackgroundImage.

	* RichTextBox.cs: same.

	* ToolBar.cs: same, but we need to also redraw the toolbar when it
	changes, so instead a handler for BackgroundImageChanged.
	
	* Control.cs: make background_image private.

2006-12-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs: change the assignment of cursor to Cursor.  not
	sure we even need this assignment, but roll with it for now.

	* Control.cs: make the cursor field private.

2006-12-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: we don't need to explicitly set ImeMode to
	ImeMode.NoControl - that's a natural fallout of Control.ImeMode's
	behavior in the face of ImeMode.Inherit.

	* ButtonBase.cs: change DefaultImeMode to ImeMode.Disable, and
	change the ctor's assignment to use ImeMode instead of ime_mode.

	* Control.cs (get_ImeMode): don't assume DefaultImeMode ==
	ImeModeInherit.  Only check for the parent's imemode (and return
	NoControl if there is no parent) if ime_Mode == ImeMode.Inherit.
	This fixes the button unit test, which sets both ImeMode and
	DefaultImeMode to ImeMode.Disable.

	also make the ime_mode field private.

2006-12-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: make control_style private.

	* TextBoxBase.cs: fix the HandleClick override.  it was explicitly
	setting the styles to true, then setting them to false instead of
	reverting to their previous values.

	also, call SetStyle on the scrollbars instead of using
	control_style directly.

2006-12-06  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* FormCollection.cs: Implement. [2.0]

2006-12-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: make tab_stop private.

	* Label.cs: set TabStop, not tab_stop.  reformat some event
	add/remove methods to make them more compact.

2006-12-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* RadioButton.cs: fix TabStop handling.

2006-12-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* TextBox.cs: remove the explicit assignments to has_focus.
	Control does that.

	* ButtonBase.cs: remove the assignment to has_focus.  Control will
	manage that.
	
2006-12-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ButtonBase.cs: remove all uses of is_enabled from this code.
	it's always true when any of the code containing the checks is
	executed.

2006-12-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ImageList.cs: reinstate the ShouldSerialize*/Reset* methods,
	with different semantics (some are present in both 1.1 and 2.0
	profiles) so that we match MS's behavior in our unit tests.

2006-12-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Make this operation undoable.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Factor the border width into the preferred
	height.
	- implement Modified as per the spec.

2006-12-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Timer.cs, Control.cs, Menu.cs: make control_tag private.

2006-12-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: make right_to_left and context_menu fields private.

2006-12-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* AccessibleObject.cs, Control.cs, XplatUIX11GTK.cs,
	XplatUIX11.cs, Form.cs, RadioButton.cs, ScrollableControl.cs: make
	Control.child_controls private.  switch all uses over to
	Control.Controls.

2006-12-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* System.Windows.Forms/GroupBox.cs,
	System.Windows.Forms/AccessibleObject.cs,

	System.Windows.Forms/ThemeWin32Classic.cs,
	System.Windows.Forms/SizeGrip.cs,
	System.Windows.Forms/ToolStripDropDown.cs,
	System.Windows.Forms/ScrollableControl.cs: Make Control.parent
	private.  switch all uses over to Control.Parent.

2006-12-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: don't assign to has_focus in GotFocus/LostFocus.
	Control does this before calling emitting these events.

	* TabControl.cs: same.

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: use Control.ClientRectangle instead of
	Control.client_rect.

	* ButtonBase.cs: use the ClientSize property instead of the
	client_size field.

	* ScrollableControl.cs: same.

	* Control.cs: another pass at making properties private.  also,
	move the initialization of tab_stop to the ctor.

2006-12-05  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Let the selected index be set freely if the 
	control handle is not yet created.

2006-12-05  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Control.cs: Revert dist_top, dist_right, and dist_bottom to 
	internal until I can rewrite DefaultLayout.
	* ToolStrip.cs: Fix build error and some general cleaning.
	* ToolStripControlHost.cs, SplitterPanel.cs, DataGridView.cs:
	Fix build errors caused by making some of Control's fields private.

2006-12-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Redo Insert a little so that it use IndexOf
	instead of Split, this prevents it from messing up on things like
	\n\n\n. Also more effecient since the split array doesn't need to
	be created.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: AppendText doesnt handle multiline and non
	multiline text differently, this is the first of many fixes that
	will make multiline/non-multiline the same thing as far as the
	TextBoxBase is concerned.
	- Don't split the text and insert lines, this can lose some line
	endings (like is the last line a soft or hard break). Instead use
	the new Insert.
	- Fix an off by one when combining all the lines in the Text
	getter.
	- Remove separate multiline handling from the Text getter/setter.

2006-12-05  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ButtonBase.cs: a few changes:

	- don't reinitialize internal Control fields in the ctor when they
	have the same values as Control sets them.

	- don't set has_focus in OnGotFocus/OnLostFocus.  Control does
	this before calling those methods.

	- we don't need to call Refresh for anything.  use Invalidate
	instead.

	- OnEnabledChanged doesn't need to redraw at all - Control.cs
	calls Refresh in its OnEnabledChanged.
	
	- several of the events we were registered for in the ctor to
	redraw ourselves already include calls to Invalidate in the
	property setters that raise the events.  remove the extra
	invalidation.

	- reformat a switch statement that was 83274658 columns wide.
	
2006-12-05  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: fix a unit test regression from a TextBox
	SelectionLength return of -1 when there's no selection.  

2006-12-05  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs, Button.cs, ThemeGtk.cs, Form.cs, ListView.cs,
	ThemeWin32Classic.cs, SizeGrip.cs, ToolBar.cs: first pass at
	cleaning up some of the internal Control fields being used by
	subclasses.

2006-12-05  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MdiWindowManager.cs:

	clicked point on the title bar does not get out of
	MdiClient's rectangle. Fixes #79982.
	
	* MdiClient.cs:
	- Added Horizontal/VerticalScrollbarVisible.
	- Simplified the scrollbar sizing algorithm.
	- Cache the difference in scrolled value in
	H/VBarValueChanged and move the calculation out
	of the for loop.

2006-12-05  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Make the Console.WriteLine in WndProc 
	write more info.

2006-12-04  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Fix default tab selection to after TabControl
	gets focus and not before. Fixes #80128

2006-12-04  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridTableStyle.cs: remove the gross calling of
	datagrid.Refresh from here.  It's a broken idea and it doesn't
	work anyway.

	* DataGrid.cs: instead, just register/unregister from the
	DataGridTableStyle events in CurrentTableStyle.  we play it
	conservatively and EndEdit + CalcAreasAndInvalidate on any event,
	even though some would most likely not require it.  Fixes bug
	#80115 (and one portion of #80117 as a side effect).

2006-12-04  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs (set_CaptionVisible): EndEdit before doing the work
	so the textbox (if any) goes away.  Fixes bug #80117.

2006-12-04  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs: set the column's readonly property
	initially based on the property descriptor's IsReadOnly.  Fixes
	bug #80044.

2006-12-04  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: wrap the dropdown style changing work in

2006-12-04  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Fix off by one, since these are one-based.
	* TextBox.cs: Select all the text when we get focus.  The TextBox
	does this but the RTB does not.

2006-12-04  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs: remove some spew.

	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs (SetColumnValueAtRow): this seems right
	but some part of me is saying "it shouldn't be here.."  At any
	rate, it fixes bug #80046.  Call IEditableObject.EndEdit after
	setting the value.

2006-12-04  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs (SetDataGrid): call CheckValidDataSource
	to reassign the propertydescriptor.

2006-12-04  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	* TextControl.cs: Remove some unused variables.  Maybe this will
	patch things up between mike and I.
	- don't split lines less then one char wide, if the viewport is
	that small text won't be visible anyways.
	
2006-12-04  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Default selection length is -1, need to do some
	more testing on windows to see when this is used for the property.
	- Redid the Lines [] property to that we properly remove soft line
	breaks
	- added support for preserving carriage returns
	-  CanUndo is not a variable like 'is undo enabled' it just returns
	true if there is undo operations available.
	- AppendText doesn't need to grab the last tag itself anymore,
	this happens automatically when we move the cursor.
	* TextControl.cs: Add CompoundActions to the undo class. This
	allows combining the other operations into one big option.  ie a
	paste will combine { delete old, insert new, move cursor }
	- Add InsertString undo operation
	- New method for deleting multiline text
	- Add carriage returns to lines. So we can preserve carriage
	returns when text is 'roundtripped'

2006-12-04  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs (CalcCellsArea): cells_area.Width/Height are at a
	minimum 0.  Fixes the scrollbar exception in bug #80136.

2006-12-04  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* StatusBar.cs: Update all panels when a AutoSize=Contents
	panel needs updating.
	
	* StatusBarPanel.cs: Remove twidth and only use initialize.
	Fixes #80031.
		
2006-12-04  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: When a form's MdiParent is set add it directly
	on top of the z-order in stead of relying on MdiClient's
	ActivateChild to do it. Fixes #80135.
	
	* MdiClient.cs: 
	- Remove original_order, mdi_child_list is already doing
	the same thing.
	- Create mdi_child_list on construction in
	stead of first use (avoids a few null checks).

	* MenuItem.cs: Use an already existing list of mdi children
	to get the correct order of children and remove the other
	redundant list.

2006-12-04  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: cached_splitter_location is only used in
	!DOUBLEBUFFER code.

	* PropertyGrid.cs: implement the ComComponentNameChanged event
	using Events, hoping that would fix the warning.  Looks like a
	compiler bug instead (#80144).

	* PropertyManager.cs: remove unused method.

2006-11-04  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Dont draw arrow when menuitem on menubar, 
	include parentesis to fix expression evaluation. Fixes #79634.

2006-11-02  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>
	
	* MenuAPI.cs:
	- Changes to fix behavior in Menu control, some reported in #80097
	and other detected during behavior refactory like a select event
	problems.
	- Remove unneded "if's" conditions.
	- Created an internal to flag when popup is active in control, we need 
	it because in .NET you can have menu active but without popup active
	when you active menu using popup without visible items.
	- Mimic win32 behavior for Select and Popup events.  
	- Dont open popup menu when you dont have visible subitems.
	- Do nothing when click on disabled menu item.
	- Some small changes to follow the coding style guidelines.
	- Unselect menu only when another control gives focus. Fixes #80097.
	- Remove unused code.
	
	* MenuItem.cs: internal VisibleItems method to check if menu
	theres visible subitems, it will be usefull to fix some 
	behavior in Menu control.
	
2006-11-01  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>
	
	* Timer.cs: Tag property for 2.0 profile.

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: comment out some unused pinvokes, and remove

	property instead of conflicting with it.

	* PictureBox.cs: comment out some unused fields

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs, XplatUIGTK.cs: nuke
	the Where/WhereString stuff.  it's easy enough to CWL
	Environment.StackTrace.

	* XplatUIX11.cs: same, but also fix up a lot of mcs warnings about
	unused private fields.

2006-12-01  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Do not update the view while inserting multiline
	text. If we update the view we might wrap lines, before entering
	the new lines, which causes the new line insertion calculations to
	be totally fubared.
	- Remove an old TODO
	- Make debug output a little nicer
	
2006-12-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ToolBar.cs: revert the ImeMode fix here and add an XXX comment.

2006-12-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	[ fix the majority of the CS0108 warnings we've been suppressing ]
	
	* TreeView.cs: mark BackgroundImageChanged as 'new'.

	* ToolBar.cs: ImeMode just passes stuff to Control.  Rename Layout
	to "LayoutToolBar" to quiet mcs.
	
	* TabControl.cs: mark our ControlCollection class as 'new'.

	events as new.

	* CheckedListBox.cs: mark our ObjectCollection class as new to
	quiet mcs.

	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs: make HelpRequest event new and have it
	muck with the base class.

	name as a base class method.

	* CheckBox.cs: mark DoubleClick "new", and add some text about

	* Panel.cs: make the events "new", and manipulate the base
	version.  these are just here for attributes.

	* Control.cs: deal with AccessibleObject.owner being private.
	cache our own copy if we need it.

	* Button.cs: add "new" to the DoubleClickEvent.

	* ListBox.cs: no need to track our own has_focus here.  let
	Control.has_focus do it for us.  Also some other work to clear up
	warnings about not overriding base class methods of the same name.

	class methods of the same name.

	warnings.

	* AxHost.cs: same.

	* PrintPreviewDialog.cs: same.

	* DataGridView.cs: fix a ton of corcompare warnings.  not all, but
	now DGV isn't so horrible on the class status page.  also, move
	all events to using System.ComponentModel.EventHandlerList.  my
	wrists hurt.

2006-12-01  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* MdiWindowManager.cs:
	- Set form to active mdi child if shown,
	and update the active mdi child to the next 
	remaining child in the z-order if the form is hidden.

	* Form.cs: 
	- Track if the form has been visible and if its 
	visibility is beeing changed, so that the MdiClient
	can properly decide the ActiveMdiChild. The MdiClient 
	cannot track this since the form can change visibility 
	before MdiClient is created.

	* MdiClient.cs:
	- Don't activate anything of the parent form is changing
	its visibility.
	- Rework ActiveMdiChild to only return visible mdi 
	children and take into account several other corner 
	cases.

	TreeViewCancelEventHandler.

2006-12-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: Form.ControlCollection already stores off the
	form_owner field.  don't access the base class's internal "owner"
	field.

	* Control.cs: make all the fields in Control.ControlCollection
	private.  there's no need for any internal fields here.

2006-12-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: call SetDataSource instead of CalcGridAreas in
	OnHandleCreated.  Fixes bug #80109.

	* ToolStripDropDown.cs: Fix for SupportsTransparency change.

2006-11-29  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs (GetWindowTransparency): check return value of
	GetLayeredWindowAttributes.  if it's 0, return 1.0, as
	SetWindowTransparency hasn't been called.

2006-11-29  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs (set_TransparencyKey): only call SetWindowTransparency
	if it's supported.
	(set_AllowTransparency): reorder things a little so that the
	WS_EX_LAYERED style is removed properly.

2006-11-29  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	[ totally cosmetic eye-candy feature, fixes bug #80089 ]
	
	* Form.cs: only call the XplatUI transparency method (get/set) if
	SupportsTransparency says it's supported. Otherwise fallback to
	doing nothing (in the set case) or returning the instance field we
	cache (in the get case).

	* XplatUIStructs.cs: add TransparencySupport flag enum.
	
	* XplatUIDriver.cs: add abstract GetWindowTransparency, and track
	change to SupportsTransparency.

	TransparencySupport.None from SupportsTransparency.

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Stub out GetWindowTransparency, and return
	TransparencySupport.Set from SupportsTransparency.

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: implement GetWindowTransparency calling
	GetLayeredWindowAttributes, and implement SupportsTransparency by
	checking whether or not both
	GetWindowTransparency/SetWindowTransparency are available
	entrypoints.  We need to do this since SetWindowTransparency is
	available as of win2k, but GetWindowTransparency requires winxp.
	yay win32 api.

	* XplatUI.cs: Add GetWindowTransparency, and change
	SupportsTransparency to allow for either/both Get/Set.

	* Form.cs: Revert previous change (remove call UpdateBounds
	from form constructor), because it messes with the handle creation
	order, and that one needs lots and lots of love.
	* PrintPreviewDialog.cs: Revert change to CreateHandle (add check
	for valid printer and throw InvalidPrinterException if document
	is set but printer not valid), adding a MonoTODO. Once 
	handle creation is done properly, we can put this back in.

2006-11-28  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuItem.cs: Create a invalidate method for menu item, to be

	constructor, it was causing a call to CreateHandle
	before it was supposed to.
	* PrintControllerWithStatusDialog: Applied patch
	by Chris Toshok to hide controller when there are
	no printers available.
	PrintDialog.cs: initialize printer settings to 
	null - correct DefaultValues test #5
	* PrintPreviewControl.cs: Move PrintController
	initialization to GeneratePreview
	* PrintPreviewDialog.cs: 
	- Remove Preview generation	from Document_set(). It is 
	called on OnPaint
	- Throw InvalidPrinterException on CreateHandle if
	a Document is set but there are no printers or 
	printer is not valid.
	* ThemeWin32Classic: don't paint PrintPreviewControl
	if there is nothing to paint	

2006-11-28  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: Add another popular method.

	* TabPage.cs: ditto.

2006-11-28  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* MenuItem.cs: Fixed a warning.
	* InternalWindowManager: Fixed a warning.

2006-11-28  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* MenuItem.cs:
	- When cloning a menu also clone MdiList and clone the 
	  window menu items properly (as the forms and menuitems
	  are kept in an internal hashtable, these need updating 
	  as well)
	- Rewrote the window menu code, menu items are added in the
	  order the forms were added to their parent, and they are
	  updated every time the window menu is shown (before the
	  list was only generated once, in the current order of the
	  forms, and would never be updated). A checkmark is shown
	  next to the item corresponding to the active mdi child.

2006-11-28  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* XplatUIStructs.cs: 
	- Added WM_NCMOUSEHOVER and WM_NCMOUSELEAVE.
	
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: 
	- Added TME_NONCLIENT to TMEFlags.
	- Handles WM_NCMOUSEMOVE in GetMessage to 
	  generate WM_NCMOUSEHOVER and WM_NCMOUSELEAVE messages.

	* MdiWindowManager:
	- Now merges mdi child menu to parent menu when maximized.
	- Recalculate NC areas of both mdi child and mdi parent. 
	  Fixes #79757 (4).
	  on window state and size changes.Fixes #79844 (3).
	- Handle WM_NCCALCSIZE to properly calculate borders.

	* Form.cs:
	- Add/remove to the mdi containers list of mdi children 
	  in the order they are added.
	- Pass on WM_NCLBUTTONUP, WM_NCMOUSEMOVE and WM_NCMOUSELEAVE 
	  to the maximized mdi child.
	
	* InternalWindowManager.cs:
	- Only execute a click on the control buttons on the mouse up,
	  not on the mouse down. Show the state of the button 
	  (was only showing Normal state, never Pressed state). The
	  pressed button now follows the mouse (if you click the Close 
	  button and move the mouse over the Maximize button, the 
	  Maximize button will be shown as pressed). Since Win32 does
	  not generate WM_NCLBUTTONUP if you release the button outside
	  of the nc area, we need to handle WM_NCMOUSELEAVE and treat
	  it as a mouse up.
	
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	- Draw a missing border around mdi child forms. Fixes #79844 (2).

	* MdiClient.cs:
	- Added a list of forms which contains the order the forms are
	  added to the mdi parent.
	- Handle WM_NCPAINT to properly draw a 3D border. Fixes #79844 (2).
	- Handle WM_NCCALCSIZE to properly calculate the 3D border.
	- If the active form changes set the scrollbars to the top
	  of the Z order, otherwise the form could hide them.
	- Scrollbars are now sized according to ClientSize, not 
	  to Size, and they take into account the other scrollbar
	  to determine maximum.
	
2006-11-28  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com>
	
	* XplatUI.cs:
	* XplatUIDriver.cs:
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	* XplatUIWin32.cs:
	* XplatUIOSX.cs:
	- Added RequestAdditionalWM_NCMessages for windows to 
	  opt in for WM_NCMOUSELEAVE and WM_NCMOUSEHOVER.
	  Currently only implemented in XplatUIWin32.

2006-11-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Hwnd.cs: only add the hwnd to the windows hash in
	set_WholeWindow and set_ClientWindow if whole_window/client_window
	are not IntPtr.Zero.  also, remove the unused SetObjectWindow.

2006-11-27  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: remove redundant OnDropDown call.  It is called
	from the ComboListBox.ShowWindow code. Fixes #79969.

2006-11-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Hwnd.cs: remove the setters for ExposePending and
	NCExposePending - noone uses them.

2006-11-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: new param for ReplaceSelection which determines
	whether we select the new selection, or set the cursor to the end
	of the new selection.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Use new param for ReplaceSelection.  When
	pasting, select the new text.
	* RichTextBox.cs: Use new param for ReplaceSelection.

2006-11-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Set the selection to the caret after the caret
	is moved, otherwise they get out of sync.

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Fix toolbar drop down arrow size.

2006-11-23  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* InternalWindowManager.cs: 
	- Handle WM_PARENTNOTIFY to activate the form
	if any child control is clicked.
	- The form is only sizable if not minimized.

	* MdiWindowManager.cs:
	- Save the IconicBounds if the form is moved.
	- Rework SetWindowState, now the window bounds 
	are stored only if the old window state is Normal.
	
	* MdiClient.cs:
	- In SetWindowStates store the old window state if 
	the window is maximized and restore window state if
	the window looses focus.
	- Don't handle any scrollbar value changes if 
	initializing the scroll bars. Fixes #79771.
	- Reworked ArrangeIconicWindows. Current algorithm
	tests bounds agains all other minimized windows, if
	any intersections create new bounds (going left to 
	right, bottom to top) and then test again. When 
	successful the bounds are saved and never computed
	again. Fixes #79774.

2006-11-23  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Added HandleTitleBarUp.

2006-11-23  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NumericUpDown.cs: In .NET 1.1, user entered text is still
        hexadecimal in ParseUserEdit.

	
2006-11-23  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* MdiWindowManager.cs: 
	- Handle a click on the form's icon to show the 
	system menu (when maximized). Fixes #79775.
	- Change the existing click handler for the form's
	icon when not maximized to show on MouseUp.
	Fixes #79776.

	* Form.cs: In OnResize only layout the mdi child's
	parent if it actually has a parent. Might not if
	the window is closing.


2006-11-23  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* MdiClient.cs: Ignore active MDI client for text of parent, if
	child has no text set.

2006-11-23  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ToolBar.cs: Fixed ToString to match MS.

2006-11-22  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* NumericUpDown: 
	- Fix DecimalPlaces, Hexadecimal and ThousandsSeparator to 
	update inner values on set. Fixes #79966.
	- Override OnLostFocus to update value on NET 2. Fixes #79950.
	- Fix hexadecimal parsing.
	
	* UpDownBase: Override OnGotFocus and OnLostFocus to notify 
	parent. Fixes #79957

2006-11-22  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: After calling SetWindowsPos in SetBoundsCore 
	the actual size has to be queried, since if height /
	width is negative Win32 changes it to 0. 
	Fixes #79999 on Windows.
	
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Set height / width to 0 if negative
	in SetWindowPos. Fixes #79999 on Linux.
	
2006-11-22  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	pressed.

2006-11-22  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	and later navigate by mouse. Fixes #79528.

2006-11-21  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ToolBar.cs: Set default value for TabStop to false in
	constructor, it fixes remaining behavior of bug #79863.

2006-11-21  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* MdiWindowManager.cs:
	* InternalWindowManager.cs:
	- Moved a few methods specific to Mdi from 
	InternalWindowManager to MdiWindowManager.
	Fixes #79996.
	
2006-11-21  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIOSX.cs: stub out InvalidateNC.

	following line), and enable the thread exception dialog.

	* Application.cs: remove the duplicate exception catching from
	here.

2006-11-20  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Toolbar.cs: Triggers button click event when click on icon
	of dropdown ToolBarButton. Fixes #79912.
	
2006-11-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Theme.cs:
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	- Added a property WindowBorderFont to enable themeing
	  of mdi child windows' Text.
	  
2006-11-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* InternalWindowManager.cs:
	* Form.cs:
	* MdiClient.cs:
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: 
	- If mdi child is maximized, set mdi parent's
	  text to "Parent - [Child]". Fixes #79770.
	- If there is any maximized mdi child windows, only the active 
	  window (and any new windows) is maximized, the rest are normal.
	- On a WindowState change only save mdi child's window bounds 
	  if the old window state was normal. Fixes #79774.
	- The scroll bars are now calculated on hopefully all
	  necessary events. Fixed #79771 / #79844->6 / #79906.
	- MdiClient.SizeScrollBars() now takes into account docked 
	  controls in the parent when calculating available space.
	- InternalWindowManager now always repaints the entire title
	  area. Fixes #79844->1/4/5.
	- Added RequestNCRecalc on mdi child windowstate changes.
	  Fixes #79772.

2006-11-20  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: setup LargeChange on the scrollbar. Invoke FireMouseUp
	in the MouseUp handler of the listbox and move the return handling
	code to FireMouseUp to avoid scrolling on ups.  Fixes #79952.

2006-11-20  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Toolbar.cs: Ignore right mouse clicks in toolbar. Fixes #79855. 

2006-11-17  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: Seems that DllImports that were fine in 1.2 are not
	  working in 1.2.x anymore. So, updated.

2006-11-19  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NumericUpDown.cs: Use NegativeSign, NumberDecimalSeparator and
	NumberGroupSeparator of current culture instead of assuming en-US.
	Fixed bug #79967.

2006-11-17  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Add the concept of implicit bounds setting so that
	dock/undock round trips preserve explicitly set size/locations.
	Fixes #79313.

2006-11-17  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Trim all filters, otherwise DirInfo.GetFiles
	  can't handle those filters. (Fixes bug #79961)

2006-11-17  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	[ fixes the exit/crashes associated with #79835.  it's clearly
	suboptimal though, we need to figure out a better way to solve
	this. ]
	
	* PrintPreviewControl.cs: deal with the new invalid printer
	exceptions.

	* PageSetupDialog.cs: if the printer is invalid, pop up a dialog
	and return false (so CommonDialog.ShowDialog doesn't actually show
	the form.)

	* PrintDialog.cs: enable/disable the Ok button depending on
	whether or not the printer is valid.

	* CommonDialog.cs (ShowDialog): only actually show the form if
	RunDialog returns true.

2006-11-17  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: When soft splitting a line, mark it as a soft
	split line. Also carry over the current line break to the next
	line.

2006-11-17  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: when scrolling a window with an invalid area, we
	only want to shift the part of the invalid area that overlaps the
	area we're scrolling.  we also don't want to clear the invalid
	area unless the invalid area was entirely contained within the
	scrolling area.

2006-11-16  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: remove the handling of the TimerEvent stuff, and
	also make sure to free the memory returned by XGetWindowProperty
	in GetText().

	* X11Structs.cs: remove the TimerEvent stuff, it's unused.

2006-11-16  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUI.cs: add a new super secret way to get at the totally
	unsupported X11 backend.

2006-11-16  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NumericUpDown.cs: Allow lowercase letters when in hex-mode.

2006-11-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Allow more explicit setting of top node position
	for scrollbars. Slower algo, but more accurate.
	- CollapseAll should maintain the current top node.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: When positioning the caret, use the line, pos
	method, since the x, y method does not grab the correct tag, and
	the caret height never gets set correctly. (Maybe I should just do
	away with the caret having its own height, and always use the
	carets current tag for height).

2006-11-16  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com

	[Fixes 79778, 79923]

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Don't allow a parent to be set to IntPtr.Zero.
	Parent to the FosterParent instead.

2006-11-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Need to recalc the topnode when we expand or
	collapse. The scrolling methods can't handle this on their own,
	since they use differences between the last scroll position, and
	those difference get completely messed up since we are expanding
	nodes.  This problem should probably be fixed in the scrolling
	methods, so they can figure out exactly where they are, but this
	will slow things down a little.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Special case for groupboxes with empty
	strings, makes nunit-gui look a lot nicer.

2006-11-16  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: nasty, nasty, nasty changes required because of
	the broken multithreaded event handling we have in here.  File
	this entry under "Why we should move to the new X11 backend".

	Any thread can make it into UpdateMessageQueue, which gets events
	from the X socket - some of which could belong to hwnds being
	managed by a different thread.  We can also have multiple threads
	in UpdateMessageQueue at the same time, with each one reading from
	the X socket.  This leads to many problems, with the following
	solutions:

	We can't use hwnd.Queue.Enqueue anywhere in here and must use
	EnqueueLocked.

	The MotionNotify compression we do can't work across threads
	(without locking the entire queue, perhaps) since we call
	hwnd.Queue.Peek, so we just punt and don't compress motion events
	unless the owning thread is the one which got the X event.

	ConfigureNotify is another fun one, since it modifies the hwnd's
	bounds and then enqueues the event.  We add a lock to Hwnd which
	is held when setting configure_pending to true (and enqueuing the
	event).

	There is a race wrt the wake socket.  we need to make sure that
	only 1 thread is waiting on that socket, or else a thread could
	sleep waiting for data that never comes.  It's difficult (but not
	impossible) to make happen, because it seems to require something
	like the following:

	    1. Thread 1 polls on wake_receive
	
	    2. poll returns saying there's data to be read on
	       wake_receive.
	
	    3. Thread 2 polls on wake_receive and immediately returns
	       saying there's data to be read.

	    4. Thread 2 reads the wakeup byte from wake_receive

	    5. Thread 1 attempts to read the wakeup byte from
	       wake_receive.

	    6. Thread 2 exits (due to a form closing, perhaps).

	    7. Thread 1 blocks forever.
	
	Fun, eh?

	Fixing the Expose handling isn't done yet, and the races inherent
	in that piece of code are responsible for the drawing mistakes you
	see when generating expose events in a MT app (like NPlot).  This
	one is the likely to be the hardest to bandaid, and it doesn't
	appear to cause anything but drawing problems.  The other issues
	caused apps to exit or hang.

	* XEventQueue.cs: output some spew when Dequeue/Enqueue/Peek are
	called from a different thread than the one that should be calling
	these functions.

	* Hwnd.cs: add some locks to be used by the XplatUIX11 code.

2006-11-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Application.cs: null out the context's MainForm when we exit
	RunLoop.  Fixes a newly checked in unit test as well as the last
	ODE from bug #79933.

2006-11-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs (set_Owner): allow a null value so we can clear the
	form's owner.
	(Dispose): set all our owned_form's Owner properties to null, and
	clear the owned_forms collection.
	(WM_CLOSE): clean up this a little bit.. still not right though.

	* ApplicationContext.cs: OnMainFormClosed should only call
	ExitThreadCore if the main form isn't recreating.  Fixes unit
	test.

2006-11-15  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	[Fixes 78346]

	* ComboBox.cs: Set the Hwnd.no_activate flag for the ComboListBox.

2006-11-15  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	[Fixes 79433]

	* Hwnd.cs: Add a flag to show a window, but not activate it, to 
	keep popup window types from stealing focus from the main form
	on Windows.

	* XPlatUIWin32.cs: Use SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE if above field is true.

	* MenuAPI.cs: Set above flag to true.

2006-11-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: mimic win32 behavior on BUTTONUP events, where
	the button being released is not in wParam.

2006-11-15  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* Form.cs: Add the released button to MouseEventArgs.Button
	for the OnMouseUp call to the MenuTracker.  Fixes menu clicking
	on Win32.

2006-11-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: add (untested) a _NET_WM_NAME implementation of
	GetText().  untested because it's unused in our implementation.
	Control.Text always caches the text, even if
	ControlStyles.CacheText is not set.

	fixes bug #79939.

2006-11-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	[ fixes #79933 ]
	
	* Form.cs: in Close() don't do anything after we send the WM_CLOSE
	message.  no hiding, no disposing.

	in the WM_CLOSE handler, hide the form if it's modal.

2006-11-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: use AddExpose instead of sending a message.
	fixes textbox border drawing.

2006-11-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: keep from crashing on mouse move/down when
	the property grid is empty.

2006-11-14  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Make PageUp and PageDown more like the MS
	versions.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: When we set the text property position the
	cursor at the beginning of the document.

2006-11-14  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: if a mdi child's WindowState has changed
	before it's creation, it would display wrong control
	buttons.
	
2006-11-14  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* TreeView.cs: De-uglify TreeView checkbox checkmarks.
	  (Fixes bug #79927)

2006-11-14  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: send a WM_NCPAINT on WM_NCCALCSIZE so that 
	the window gets to paint its borders even if the window is
	getting	smaller.
	
	* Form.cs: on a WM_NCPAINT invalidate the entire menu, 
	otherwise the old control buttons would still be painted 
	if the window gets bigger.
	
	* PaintEventArgs.cs: add an internal method so that the clip 
	rectangle can be changed.
	
2006-11-13  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	[ fixes bug #79745 ]
	
	* NotifyIcon.cs: lots of cleanup.

	* X11Structs.cs: add an enum for XEMBED messages.

	* XplatUIX11.cs: reindent one of the giant switch statements, it
	was taking up an additional tab stop, and this file is already way
	too wide for my laptop's screen.

	Also, add handling for the XEmbed EMBEDDED_NOTIFY message.  When
	we get it, resize the hwnd to the WMNormalHints max_width/height.

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Compute the value changes for the mouse wheel
	teh simple way.

2006-11-13  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIStructs.cs: kind of a gross fix for
	#79898.  force a reference to the Region to stick around so the
	unmanaged object isn't collected (rendering our handle in the MSG
	stale).

2006-11-13  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: fix #79917 for window managers which support

	using XStoreName on the raw utf8, and we need to convert to
	COMPOUND_TEXT if it's non-latin1.

2006-11-13  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs (set_DialogResult): we need to set closing to false if
	we're setting our result to None.  fixes bug #79908.

2006-11-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: When formatting text, compute the adjusted tag
	lengths correctly, using FindTag for the end tag instead of trying
	to figure it out outselves.
	* TreeNode.cs: Use ActualItemHeight, which is the actual height of
	the item, ItemHeight doesn't work, because trees with large
	imagelists use those for their height
	* TreeView.cs: ActualItemHeight factors in the image height
	- compute left edge of checkboxes correctly
	- when expanding/collapsing move the bottom down one pixel, so we
	aren't moving part of the node

2006-11-13  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: The PaintEventArgs is also added to the drawing
	stack in PaintEventStart so that it won't get disposed by the gc
	before reaching PaintEventEnd.

2006-11-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Don't select the word if we are on a line with
	no text.
	- We don't need to position the caret on mouse up, since the mouse
	move handler should be doing this
	- When double clicking a blank line, the caret is advanced to the
	next line.

2006-11-13  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Avoid duplicating indexer code.

2006-11-12  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ColorDialog.cs: Reset size of dialog between calls to ShowDialog.
	Fixes part of bug #79910.

2006-11-11  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ColorDialog.cs: Fix a NRE when adding a color to custom colors
	  (bug #79903). Some minor string updates to match ms.

2006-11-10  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Don't add an extension if the filename
	  already ends with that extension.

2006-11-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Use the currently highlighted node for the
	BeforeSelect event.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: There is no need to expand selection on
	MouseMove.
	- CanUndo means 'is there any undo operations', not 'is undo
	allowed on this textcontrol. Fixed ClearUndo unit test.

2006-11-10  Andreia Gaita  <shana.ufie@gmail.com>

	* Button.cs: only perform click when button is Selectable (so as 
	not to activate default buttons when they're disabled)
	
	* Control.cs: Rewrite of the SelectNextControl and related 
	methods. HandleClick now selects next control if the current one
	is being disabled.
	
	* Form.cs: OnActivated selects next active control only if Load 
	has already occurred. If Load hasn't run, there's no point in 
	selecting here, Load might change the state of controls.
	
	* FocusTest.cs: Tests marked as working again for these fixes

2006-11-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: a couple of fixes.

	- use XInternAtoms with almost all the atoms we need to register,
	instead of many, many calls to XInternAtom.  should help a bit on
	startup time, at the expense of making the code look a little
	worse.

	- fall back to setting TransientFor on TOOLWINDOW's if their hwnd
	isn't reparented (which seems to be a clue that we're running fon
	compiz) and they have an Owner form.  This fixes the tool windows
	in paint.net when running under compiz.

	- when setting the opacity of a window, support both the case
	where the window has been reparented and also when it hasn't been.
	Since compiz/beryl doesn't seem to reparent windows, and these are
	the only window managers which support translucency, I'm not sure
	why we need the hwnd.reparented case at all.. but leave it in.
	now we get translucent windows in paint.net under compiz/beryl.

2006-11-10  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Always return the value for FilterIndex that
	  was set. Internally convert it to values that make sense.

2006-11-10  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>
	
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Fix drowp down arrow borders.

2006-11-10  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Toolbar.cs: Change default value of DropDownArrows to true, the 
	signature still using false to make it compatible with MS but the 
	initial value is true. Fixes #79855.

2006-11-10  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: Don't throw an exception on windows. Mime stuff is
	  only available on Linux.

2006-11-09  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Toolbar.cs, ToolBarButton.cs: Fix wrong separator size and
	reduce number of calls to redraw method during toolbar creation.

2006-11-09  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs : raise SelectedIndexChanged when an item is selected
	programmatically via the Item.Selected property.  Gert's nice 
	ListViewSelectedIndexChanged test fixture now runs clean.

2006-11-09  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs : raise SelectedIndexChanged when a selected item is
	removed from the item collection using Remove or RemoveAt.

2006-11-09  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs : raise SelectedIndexChanged once per selected item
	for compat with MS.  Fixes #79849+.

2006-11-09  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs: initialize row_count to 0, and set it to 1 when
	we need to (if we have any tab pages).  Fixes unit test.

2006-11-09  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Label.cs (CalcPreferredWidth): if Text == "", our preferred
	width is 0, not 3.  Fixes a unit test.

2006-11-09  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs : use Implicit scrollbars so that focus isn't 
	stolen from the listview when they are clicked. Fixes #79850.

2006-11-09  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs (OnPaint): only call DrawGridItems if we
	have a root item.  Fixes #79879.

2006-11-09  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs:
	  - Fix ToString ()
	  - An ArgumentException is now thrown if a wrong filter
	    is applied (matches ms). The previous filter doesn't change
	    anymore if an exception is thrown.
	  - Changing the FileName property also affects FileNames
	* ColorDialog.cs: The length of the CustomColors array is always
	  16. It doesn't matter if we use a smaller array or null to update
	  or change the custom colors property.
	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs: Throw an InvalidEnumArgumentException if
	  for RootFolder if we get a undefined value.

2006-11-09  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* StatusBarPanel.cs: 
	- Width is set to MinWidth if Width is smaller than
	MinWidth. Fixes #79842.
	- MinWidth now always overrides Width (MSDN says MinWidth
	is set to Width when AutoSize = None, but they do not 
	behave like that).
	- Style has now the the correct default value.
	
2006-11-09  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>
 
 	* TrackBar.cs: 
 	- The control is completely invalidated on 
 	Got/LostFocus to draw the focus rectangle correctly.
 	- When AutoSize then height is always 45 (width for 
 	vertical controls).
 	
 	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: The TrackBar thumb is now centered
 	on the mouse when moved and it doesn't move when grabbed
 	until the mouse moves as well. Also fixed some wrong 
 	calculations when clicking on the thumb (control thought
 	click was outside of thumb and didn't grab it).
 	Fixes some of the issues in #79718.

2006-11-08  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Toolbar.cs: Prevent disabled button to highlight. Fixes #79868.

2006-11-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: only call ToggleValue if the item is not
	readonly.

2006-11-08  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: The RichTextBox and textbox have very different
	word selection methods.  Implement the textbox's simple word
	selection here, and let the RichTextBox override and provide it's
	own.
	- Don't do extra selection on mouseup
	* RichTextBox.cs: Use the documents word selection algorithm, I
	think ideally, this function will be pulled into the
	RichTextBox.cs code someday.

2006-11-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* RootGridEntry.cs: new class to represent GridItemType.Root.

	* CategoryGridEntry.cs: reformat, and add boilerplate.
	
	* GridEntry.cs: remove the UIParent stuff - turns out .Parent
	returns the UI parent anyway, and we need special handling to
	implement the GetTarget method in the face of it.  Also, implement
	Select().

	* PropertyGrid.cs, PropertyGridView.cs: a number of fixes.  create
	a root grid item, and use that instead of PropertyGrid.grid_items.
	Also, make use of TypeConverters (and add limitted support for
	ICustomTypeDescriptors) when initially populating the grid.
	Arrays now show up more or less properly.

2006-11-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Application.cs: set the modal dialog to non modal after we close
	it.  Fixes bug #79866.

2006-11-08  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: When combining lines carry over the line end
	style from the end line.
	- Invalidate the selected area when setting it, if it is visible.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Only rich text box can do full line selects.
	- Make sure to set the cursor position when there is a click,
	otherwise two clicks in separate areas could cause a large chunk
	to be selected.

2006-11-07  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Toolbar.cs: Release flat button borders when Toolbar lost focus. 
	Fixes #79863.

2006-11-07  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* Toolbar.cs: Prevent toolbar to open more than one tooltip at same
	time. Remove tooltips when ToolButton click events.  Fixes #79856.

2006-11-07  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Ignore right click for menu actions and fixes
	menu border when clicked.  Fixes #79846.

2006-11-07  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIX11.cs: Fix MouseRelease to only release
	MouseState after create wParam for message, this fixes mouse button 
	equal none in mouse up events.
	
2006-11-07  Andreia Gaita  <shana.ufie@gmail.com>

	* Control.cs : Focus() now calls Select to set the Container's
	Active Control and to give it focus. To avoid infinite recursion
	(because ActiveControl also calls Focus at one point), a check 
	is made in Focus with the help of a new internal variable
	is_focusing.

2006-11-07  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs : raise OnSelectedIndexChanged in CreateHandle
	if there's a selection.  Fixes #79849.

2006-11-07  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* PropertyGrid.cs: Avoid fixed height of help description label.
	Fixes part of bug #79829.

2006-11-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: fix #79790 again, by using the
	_NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR atom to implement Form.ShowInTaskbar.

2006-11-07  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ToolBar.cs: Fix left click checking.

2006-11-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ProgressBar.cs: fix a typo in ToString().  fixes a unit test.

2006-11-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* RelatedPropertyManager.cs: set property_name in our ctor.  fixes
	PropertyManager unit tests.

	* PropertyManager.cs: make property_name internal.

2006-11-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ButtonBase.cs: initialize base.ime_mode to ImeMode.Disable to
	pass a unit test.  Also, don't set image_index to anything in
	response to setting the ImageList property.

2006-11-07  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ToolBar.cs: Ignore click events when mouse button is not a
	left button, only accepts other button for dropdown menus.  
	Fixes #79854.

2006-11-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: make the back and parent row buttons a little less
	ugly.

2006-11-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: When converting to Text don't put line breaks in
	for soft line breaks.
	* TextControl.cs: There is an initial "fake" line in the document,
	this is now a soft break line, so that an extra line feed doesn't
	get added to the end of documents.

2006-11-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	[ fix bug #79778 ]
	
	* CurrencyManager.cs: if the list is readonly, don't bother
	checking if IBindingList.AllowNew is true.

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs (DataGridPaintParentRow): make this work
	for non-DataRowView datasources..  or rather, make it not crash.
	(DataGridPaintRelationRow): make sure we limit the row painting to
	the area not covered by the row header, and make our cell width at
	least large enough to cover the relation area.  This allows grids
	that have relations but no rows to render correctly.
	(DataGridPaintRowContents): same type of changes here.
	(SetDataSource): move back to always calling
	CalcAreasAndInvalidate.  this fixes a crash/drawing problem when
	navigating back through relations.
	(HitTest): handle the case where we have no cells but have
	relations.  Right now we generate a hit in cell 0 of whatever the
	row is, not sure if this is strictly correct, but it works for our
	purposes.
	
	* DataGrid.cs (EndEdit, CancelEdit): if we have no columns, don't
	bother doing anything.

2006-11-07  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* StatusStrip.cs, ToolStripStatusLabel.cs: By request, an
	early version of StatusStrip.  Not responsible for eaten
	application or firstborn children.

2006-11-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs: in OnGotFocusInternal/OnLostFocusInternal don't
	call GetTabRect with a -1 index.  Fixes #79847.

2006-11-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Update scrollbars after clearing.

2006-11-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* NumericUpDown.cs: fix the ToString method for some unit test
	love.

2006-11-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyGrid.cs:
	- set the initial SelectedGridItem if we can.

	- Exclude non-mergable properties only if we're merging > 1
	object.  Merging 1 object isn't really merging, obviously.

	- Handle PropertySort.NoSort just like Alphabetical, which is
	wrong of course, but at least gets things on the screen.
	
	* PropertyGridView.cs:
	- Add method "FindFirstItem" which finds the first property grid
	item, so we can select it by default.

	- make use of GridEntry.CanResetValue.

	- Don't call RedrawBelowItemOnExpansion here anymore, the
	individual GridEntry's will do that.

	- Remove the ITypeDescriptorContextImpl internal class.
	
	* GridEntry.cs:
	- this class needs to implement ITypeDescriptorContext, as it's
	what MS's PropertyDescriptorGridEntry does, which means we can
	remove the ITypeDescriptorContextImpl internal class from
	PropertyGrid.cs.  This fixes the crashing portion of bug #79829.

	- keep a reference to our PropertyGridView, and move the call to
	RedrawBelowItemOnExpansion here from PGV.  This means
	programmaticly setting Expanded actually does something visible.

	- add a CanResetValue() function which takes into account our
	possibly multiple "selected_objects" in the merged case.  Shifting
	PropertyGridView to use this method fixes another unreported
	crasher found running the test for #79829.

	- when Top or Bounds is updated, make sure the PropertyGridTextBox
	is updated to reflect this.

	* CategoryGridEntry.cs: the ctor takes the PGV now.
	
2006-11-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: These are 1 based.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: When setting the selected text, don't change the
	selected text tags, this is done by ReplaceText, just position the
	cursor at the end of the new text.

2006-11-06  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ListView.cs: Allow label edit only when, when LabelEdit is
	  set to true.

2006-11-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: If a suitable wrapping position isn't found,
	just wrap right in the middle of a word.

2006-11-06  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ListView.cs, ListViewItem.cs: Implement LabelEdit. Fixes
	  bug #79820.

2006-11-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Can't use the VisibleCount property when setting
	scrollbar heights, because this doesn't take into account whether
	or not the horz scrollbar just came visible.

2006-11-05  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Deactivate menu on mouse up when menus it is already
	activated.  Fixes #79369, #79832.

2006-11-05  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: *sigh* Because of recent runtime changes (r67043) I
	  had to remove support for links that point to a directory. FileInfo
	  returns no usefull information (means, the directory they point to)
	  for such links. Replaced some empty string ("") with String.Empty.

2006-11-04  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: To match MS, in 1.0 profile throw 
	NullReferenceException when attempting to remove node that is not in
	collection. Throw NullReferenceException when null is passed to 
	Remove.	Allow first element of the collection to be removed. Fixes
	bug #79831.  In GetEnumerator ().Current return null if positioned 
	before the first element of the collection. In GetEnumerator ().Reset,
	position before first element of the collection.

2006-11-04  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* PropertyGrid.cs: To match MS, remove default title and description
	for panel. Fixed tooltips for Categorized and Alphabetic toolbar
	buttons.

2006-11-04  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Theme.cs: add a Clamp method, just for kicks.

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: clamp all color components to [0..255].

2006-11-04  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: if the form isn't visible, Close() does nothing.

2006-11-03  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs (Close): if the form is modal, don't Dispose of it, only
	Hide it.
	(WndProc): don't Dispose after handling the WM_CLOSE message.

	* Application.cs (RunLoop): toplevels is a list of Forms, so treat
	them as such, instead of using casts from Control to Form.  Also,
	don't Dispose of the modal dialog when we fall out of the loop -
	Close() it instead.

	fixes bug #79813.

2006-11-03  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (Dispose): only go through the dispose thing if we're
	@disposing, and we haven't already been disposed.  Fixes bug
	#79814.

	* Form.cs: no reason to call "base.Dispose()" here instead of
	"Dispose()".

2006-11-03  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs : use ToString instead of casts in AddItem for
	sorting functionality.  Fixes #79812.

2006-11-03  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Application.cs: pave the way for actually using the thread
	exception dialog.  it's ifdefed out at the moment.

2006-11-03  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ThreadExceptionDialog.cs: until we get a better layout, actually
	hide the details textbox and label when we shouldn't see them.

2006-11-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Don't bail from the scrollbar calcs for non
	multiline textboxes anymore.  This method also determines the
	width/height of a textboxes canvas area.
	- Sorta a revert of the last patch.  For multiline just position
	the controls, then bail.  This way the scrollbar width won't be
	altered.

2006-11-03  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Dont paint inner lines of 3D border when
	it dont need.  Fixes #79537.

2006-11-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: We always allow copy, since XDND implies Copy.  Also
	send the status after firing the DndOver event.

2006-11-02  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* TrackBar.cs: Now orientation only switches height / width if
	the control's handle is created (Win32 does it like this). Also 
	fixed a typo in ToString() for a test to pass, changed the 
	exception thrown in set_LargeChange and set_SmallChange to 
	match Win32 behaviour, and added TrackBar tests to the unit 
	tests.

2006-11-02  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: the atom we want is _NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR,
	not _NET_WM_STATE_NO_TASKBAR.

2006-11-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Increment count by one, since in the update view
	count - 1 is used.

2006-11-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Use client rectangle not bounds for checking if
	the mouse is in the client rectangle (duh).

2006-11-02  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>
	
	* TrackBar.cs: Fixed trackbar jumping around when clicking
	on it - the trackbar was not detecting correctly at which
	side of the thumb the click was done. (fixes #79718)

2006-11-02  Everaldo Canuto  <everaldo@simios.org>

	* ListBox.cs: scroll visible area when change SelectedIndex to
	a non visible area.  Fixes #79481.

2006-11-01  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: When replacing the selection move the selection
	start/end/anchor to the end of the new text.

2006-11-01  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: When setting the parent change the controls
	visibility to it's visibility flag, not to it's old parents
	visibility (.Visible walks the parent chain).

2006-11-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: revert the #79790 fix, as the simple.
	XSetTransientForHint fix breaks paint .net's tool windows.  more
	work needed for that one.

2006-11-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs: throw ArgumentException instead of Exception in
	LargeChange/SmallChange setters.  fixes unit tests.

2006-10-31	Andreia Gaita <shana.ufie@gmail.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs: reverted rev.67183 (which was itself
	a reversion of rev.66853... eh).
	
	* Control.cs: Fixes Reflector hang by changing Focus() call
	to what it was before rev.66643 (calling Select() here sets 
	ActiveControl, which in some situations calls back Focus and 
	eventually does a stack overflow). Temp fix.	
	Changes to GetNextControl() to not look for children to select when
	parent cannot be selectable (so it looks for siblings instead)	
	
2006-10-31  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* CheckedListBox.cs : off by one error in returned index from
	ObjectCollection.Add.  Fixes #79758.

2006-10-31  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* UpDownBase.cs: remove the OnGotFocusInternal/OnLostFocusInternal
	calls for the textbox/spinner, to keep from recursing to the point
	where we crash.  Fixes #79760.

2006-10-31  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ListControl.cs (set_SelectedValue): don't throw exceptions on
	null/"" value, just return.  matches ms's behavior and fixes some
	failing tests.

2006-10-31  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (set_Capture): make a logic a little easier to
	follow.

	* XplatUIX11.cs (CleanupCachedWindows): zero out the Grab window
	if it's being destroyed.  A necessary fix surely, but a bandaid
	also, to fix the stuck capture problem in bug #78413.

2006-10-31  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: fix a couple of compiler warnings, and follow the
	convention of clearing hwnd.ClientRect when we set the
	width/height (so it'll be recalculated by Hwnd).

2006-10-31	Andreia Gaita <shana.ufie@gmail.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs: reversed Contains check from
	ActiveControl due to hanging problems. This fix
	partly regresses #79667 (button does not have
	initial focus), so this might be a symptom for 
	a larger parenting problem (set_ActiveControl
	is being called but the child control does
	not have the parent set yet?)	
	
2006-10-31  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs : fix keynav when menu is click activated.

2006-10-31  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip*: Version 0.2.

	* MenuStrip.cs: Version 0.1.

	* Form.cs: Add a 2.0 MenuStrip tracker like the 1.1 Menu one.

2006-10-30  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	[ fixes the oversized notify icon issue in bug #79745 ]
	
	* NotifyIcon.cs: scale the icon down to the size we're given by
	the XplatUI layer (this would be faster if we did it once instead
	of whenever we paint..)  Also, remove the WM_NCPAINT handling,
	since it's never invoked.

	* XplatUIX11.cs: the gnome and kde systrays use icons that are 24
	pixels high by default, so let's hardcode our systray icon to that
	size.  The SYSTEM_TRAY protocol should really have a way for
	client apps to query for the correct icon size.. but oh well.  A
	couple of patches to deal with the screwy client_window ==
	whole_window notifyicon stuff (we don't want to PerformNCCalc, for
	instance, and also make sure we don't XSelectInput twice).

2006-10-30  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: ugh, the unit test fix (CH11, yesterday) breaks when
	recreating forms.  Control recreation is the bane of my existence.
	Fix it in a way that keeps everyone happy.

2006-10-30  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: use StructureNotifyMask on all whole_windows, not
	just non-CHILD ones.  otherwise sometimes scrollbars end up with
	client_windows not being resized to the proper size (ReportBuilder
	shows this extremely well).

2006-10-30  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (SetWMStyles): reinstate the XSetTransientForHint
	for non-WS_EX_APPWINDOW windows.  This is what keeps them from
	showing up in the gnome taskbar.  Fixes bug #79790.

2006-10-30  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ApplicationContext.cs: guard against a NRE.

	* Application.cs: null out the old MainForm for the context, so we
	don't try to use it again once it's disposed.  Fixes bug #79783.

2006-10-30  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs (set_DataSource, set_DataMember): if we have a
	BindingContext, set the data source directly, otherwise do the
	lazy approach - the actual ListManager will be created when we get
	a BindingContext. Fixes bug #79700.

2006-10-30  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs,
	  XplatUIX11.cs: Remove old 2 parameter SetVisible.

	* Control.cs: Use the new 3 parameter SetVisible with activate = true.

2006-10-30  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs: Add an overload
	of SetVisible that allows a window to be shown, but not activated.
	This is needed on Windows for MenuStrip, and can probably be used
	with MainMenu and ComboBox to fix the focus stealing issues on
	Windows.

	* XplatUIOSX.cs, XplatUIX11.cs: Not needed, call existing SetVisible.

2006-10-30  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* PictureBox.cs: Fix the output of the ToString method.

2006-10-29  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (get_TopLevelControl): fix bug #79781.

2006-10-29  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ListControl.cs (set_DataSource): throw Exception here, not
	ArgumentException, to match MS behavior.

2006-10-29  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: remove the try-catch's around calls to GetWindowState.
	We can just check the return value.

	* XplatUIX11.cs: don't throw exceptions from GetWindowState.
	Instead return -1.

	* XplatUI.cs: Add note about additional return value for
	GetWindowState.

2006-10-29  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (CreateHandle): when we create our handle, we also
	create the handles of our child controls.  Fixes one of the
	Control unit tests (CH11).

2006-10-28  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: If a gnome icon doesn't exist add a default icon.

2006-10-28  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs: A little speedup.

2006-10-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: implement Control.FromChildHandle in a way that
	matches the docs (and fixes the failed test.)

2006-10-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridTableStyle.cs: reproduce buggy MS behavior (with
	comments).

	* DataGrid.cs: implement ResetForeColor such that the tests
	succeed.
	
2006-10-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ToolBarButton.cs: setting text/tooltiptext to null results in it
	being set to "".  Fixes bug #79759.

2006-10-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: We need to clear the entire selection area when
	setting the start, otherwise multiline selections are still
	visible.

2006-10-26  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: 

	- ifdef all the code specific to the double
	buffer case, and provide some alternatives in the non-doublebuffer
	code, which makes heavy use of XplatUI.ScrollWindow to move things
	around without having to invalidate (and cause flicker).  There
	are still some drawing problems in the non-doublebuffered case, so
	DOUBLEBUFFER is defined by default.

	- Fix the way dropdowns are handled.  now we explicitly watch for
	the events which might cause the dropdown to close, and break out
	of the nested event loop there.  This gets rid of all Capture
	code, at the expense of the Msg special casing.  Seems to work,
	though, and fixes bug #79743.

2006-10-27  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com>
	* Control.cs: SetIsRecreating now recreates implicitly added
	child controls as well. Finally fixes #79629. The flag passed to 
	SetIsRecreating has also been removed since it wasn't used.
	
2006-10-26  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* PageSetupDialog.cs: Clean some code, fix some bits, 
	add some checks, and add a printer sub-dialog.

2006-10-26  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyGrid.cs: make set_SelectedObject call
	set_SelectedObjects, and move the duplicate logic to the
	SelectedObjects setter.  Also, raise SelectedObjectsChanged.

	* PropertyGridView.cs: hide the textbox when we get a
	SelectedObjectsChanged event.

	Fixes bug #79748.

2006-10-26  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: deal with the type converter not supporting
	GetStandardValues() or GetStandardValues() returning null, which
	is does in the default case.  Fixes #79742.

2006-10-25  Andreia Gaita <shana.ufie@gmail.com>

	* CheckedListBox.cs: nunit no longer crashes when selecting 
	Project/Edit menu option
	
2006-10-25  Andreia Gaita <shana.ufie@gmail.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: prevent ExecFocusedItem from blowing up if there
	is no menu selected. fixes #79739

2006-10-25  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: factor out the splitter invalidation code
	into the SplitterPercent setter, and for kicks implement the
	Ctrl-Left/Ctrl-Right handling that moves the splitter by a small
	amount in either direction.

2006-10-25  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: do some cleanup of the brush used to draw
	text - read only fields should be grayed out.  not sure how to do
	this with the textbox, though.  but the textbox's should also be
	readonly now at least.  Also, hide/show the textbox when resizing
	the control.
	
	* CursorConverter.cs: use System.Reflection when getting the
	properties of Cursors, as TypeDescriptor.GetProperties isn't
	returning static properties.

2006-10-25  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: factor out the up/down handling, and reuse
	it for page up/down.  also add End/Home support.

2006-10-25  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs:

	- ensure the selected grid item is visible in the scrolled area,
	fixes bug #79572.

	- fix Keys.Down handling when you're on the last item in the
	propertygrid.

2006-10-25  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs : set the ActiveTracker for MainMenu non-popup 
	clicks too.  Fixes #79725.

2006-10-24  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyGrid.cs: use property.Converter instead of
	TypeDescriptor.GetConverter(property.PropertyType), so we catch
	TypeConverters declared on the property as well as on the
	PropertyType.  Fixes bug #79678.

2006-10-24  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs, Mime.cs:
	  Fallback to the default platform handler if no shared mime info
	  stuff exists (fixes #79693).

2006-10-20 Andreia Gaita <shana.ufie@gmail.com>
	* ContainerControl.cs: Incorrect contains check in ActiveControl 
	from previous fix (duh).

2006-10-20  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: the dropdown should be MIN(number of items
	in list, 15).  Fixes #79551.

2006-10-20 Andreia Gaita <shana.ufie@gmail.com>
	Fixes #79384, #79394, #79652, #79667
	* Application.cs: 
	
	- Modal windows are now destroyed in the proper order for windows
	
	* ContainerControl.cs:
	
	- ActiveControl setter has more conditions on when to return:
		- if we're reselecting the active control, but it actually
		didn't have focus (window hidden or some such), it runs
		- if the active control being selected doesn't actually 
		exist in the container, it returns
	
	* Form.cs
	
	- The ShowDialog now gets the current form as the owner when
	invoking without parameters, and correctly activates the owner 
	when returning
	
	* MessageBox.cs
	
	- MessageBox now catches the Escape key to exit

2006-10-20  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: fix a number of issues (bug #78565, and
	most of bug #79676):

	- you can navigate around the property grid with the arrow keys.

	- the dropdown is sized properly when the pg has a vertical
	scrollbar.

	- fix the indentation for subentries, and properly select the
	entire label rect.

	- fix the gray bar's drawing (only draw it to the last element,
	not for the height of the control.  Also make sure we draw that
	last horizontal grid line.

	- use the same mechanism the datagrid uses wrt the editing textbox
	when scrolling/resizing/etc.  Namely, we hide it first, do the
	operation, then show it again (if it's still visible).
	
	- aggressively remove a lot of unnecessary refreshes (and also
	calls to Invalidate(). call more limited variants, and only redraw
	what we need.)
	
	* PropertyGrid.cs:

	- when we're populating the merged collection, fill in the UI
	parent with either the passed in item, or the category item we
	create.

	- remove the Refresh call from the BorderHelpControl.OnSizeChanged.

	* GridItem.cs: drop some fully qualified names.
	
	* GridEntry.cs: add a "UIParent", which is basically the parent
	treenode.

	* GridItemCollection.cs: add an IndexOf method.

2006-10-20  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MainMenu.cs : go back to Draw in OnMenuChanged.  Until we get
	a working win32 NC invalidation mechanism, we can't invalidate
	menus.  [Fixes #79705]

2006-10-20  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListBox.cs : don't update the VScrollbar if the list is empty,
	just hide it.  [Fixes #79692]

2006-10-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: Handle some special chars better, and don't skip
	the entire group when we encounter a special char that we don't
	handle correctly.

2006-10-18  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: address a number of issues from bug #79676,
	mostly of the cosmetic variety.

	- The highlight rectangle for indented items not extends all the
	way to the left.

	- Indented items aren't indented so much.

	- the dropdown is properly sized width-wise if the pg has a
	vertical scrollbar.

2006-10-18  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (SystrayAdd): a rather convoluted change, but the
	systray stuff is rather convoluted to begin with.

	systray icons are a single window for some reason (that I haven't
	figured out yet), and for them, client_window == whole_window.
	Given the way the tests are structured elsewhere to determine
	which paints are pending (client vs. nc), that situation will
	always yield PAINT, not NCPAINT.  So, if we have a pending
	nc_expose and no pending expose, remove the hwnd from the paint
	queue, and also set nc_expose_pending to false, to keep us from
	blocking further expose's adding the hwnd to the paint queue.

	phew.  like i said, a rather convoluted change.  Fixes the
	notifyicon repaint issues in bug #79645.

2006-10-18  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: when getting the backcolor of the form, don't get
	base.BackColor, as this allows parents to influence the background
	color.  This breaks mdi forms.  Instead, if the background_color
	is empty, return the default.

2006-10-18  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: change some debug ifdefs, and return XGetParent
	to being private instead of internal static.

	* Control.cs: remove all the stupid ParentWaitingOnRecreation
	crap, it wasn't working for more deeply nested controls anyway,
	and we already have the is_recreating flag - use that instead.
	Before calling DestroyHandle in RecreateHandle, recurse through
	the control tree setting it to true.  this returns the recreate
	code to much of its original simplicity, while now guaranteeing we
	actually recreate everything we're supposed to.  This change gets
	fyireporting actually showing mdi children.

2006-10-17  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: remove some debug spew, and collapse some duplicate
	code at the end of SetClientSizeCore.

	* XplatUIX11.cs: 
	- add some more debug spew here too wrt Destroy handling.
	- don't call hwnd.Dispose in DestroyWindow, it's effectively done
	in Control's handling of WM_DESTROY.
	- Remove the handling of zombie window DestroyNotifies from the
	event loop - we don't need it.  Now the only DestroyNotifies we
	actually handle are ones generated by X.
	- When sending _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW, the first param should be 1, to
	match gtk's (functioning) handling of this. This keep metacity
	from leaving droppings in the form of wm borders with no window
	contents all over the place.

	* Control.cs:
	- add a bunch of debug spew wrt control recreation.
	- fix a bug where we weren't tracking Visible properly on
	recreated hwnds.
	- fixed the WM_PAINT double buffer handling to support re-entrant
	calls (yes, i know it's gross, but it's happening to us).

2006-10-17  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <rolfkvinge@ya.com>
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: changed drawing of selected days
	to make them look better.

2006-10-16  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Hwnd.cs: replace the user_data/client_dc/non_client_dc with
	drawing_stack.  Nuke the ClientDC/NonClientDC properties.

	* XplatUIX11.cs: move away from using hwnd.client_dc and
	hwnd.non_client_dc and on to a stack of dc's (and in window's
	case, PAINTSTRUCT's), so we can deal with nested Paint calls
	without puking or not disposing of Graphics objects.

	* XplatUIOSX.cs: same.

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: same.

2006-10-03  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Don't call on_directory_changed inside
	  OnSelectedIndexChanged (it changes the SelectedIndex too).
	  Instead move it to OnSelectionChangeCommitted.

2006-10-13  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: more Destroy work.  the current code does the
	following things, in order:

	1. Enumerates all handles of all controls at or below the one
	being destroyed, in pre-order.  As it is doing this, it marks the
	handles as zombie and clears all references to them.
	
	2. calls XDestroyWindow on the window passed in.

	3. SendMessage's WM_DESTROY to all he handles in the accumulated
	list.

2006-10-13  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: set hwnd.zombie to true before calling
	SendMessage (WM_DESTROY).  this keeps us from marking the new
	window a zombie, and also keeps us from calling sendmessage at
	all.

2006-10-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Do not show the caret and selection at the same
	time.  Reduces ugliness by 35%.

2006-10-13  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (SendWMDestroyMessages): set the hwnd to be a
	zombie after we do the recursive call, so we actually do call
	SendMessage on the children controls.
	(GetMessage): if we find a pending paint event for a zombie hwnd,
	remove the hwnd from the paint queue, or else it will always be
	there (and we'll effectively loop infinitely)

2006-10-13  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MenuItem.cs : add Selected format under keynav too.
	Fixes #79528.

2006-10-13  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* PropertyGrid.cs: Fixed some NRE's and small difference between our
	implementation and that of MS.

2006-10-13  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (OnInvalidated) only futz with the invalid_region if
	the control is double buffered.  this fixes the apparent hang in
	the ListView unit tests.  Someone needs to make the
	BeginEndUpdateTest not call OnInvalidated 15004 times, though..

2006-10-13  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs:

	- do a little refactoring so that only one place calls
	dropdown_form.Hide, and that is CloseDropDown.  make everywhere
	else call that.  Also make it Refresh, since there are redraw bugs
	otherwise (we should take a look at that...)

	- do a little more refactoring work to share the body of code
	involved with the drop down.  it was duplicated in the code
	dealing with the listbox handling and in the code dealing with the
	UITypeEditors.

	- add a Capture to the dropdown form's control once it's
	displayed, and add a MouseDown handler that checks to make sure
	the position is inside the control.  If it's not, close the
	dropdown.  This fixes #78190.

	- in SetPropertyValueFromUITypeEditor, only call SetPropertyValue
	if the value is different than the initial value.
	
2006-10-13  Andreia Gaita  <shana.ufie@gmail.com>

	* Control.cs: see #78650
	- Fixed GetNextControl for several cases:
		- Changed FindFlatForward to return 
		correct sibling control when more than one
		control has same TabIndex as the currently 
		focused one.
		- Changed FindFlatBackward to loop children
		from last to first and apply same logic as in
		FindFlatForward
		- Changed FindControlForward to search for
		children when control is not a container
		but has children, or search for siblings if
		control is a container...
		- Changed FindControlBackward	to continue
		searching for child controls when hitting 
		Panel-like parents
		
	- Fixed Focus method to update ActiveControl
	(FocusTest.FocusSetsActive failure)
	
	* TabControl.cs:
	- Focus rectangle now refreshes when gaining
	or losing focus
	- Removed grab for Tab key on IsInputKey that 
	was keeping tab navigation from working (#78650)

2006-10-13  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs:
	- Rewrite SetPropertyValue to loop over SelectedGridItem's
	SelectedObjects.

	- Deal with GridItem.Value == null a few places.

	* PropertyGrid.cs: 
	- replace the PopulateGridItemCollection with a pair of methods
	which compute the intersection of all the properties in the
	SelectedObjects array.  Fixes #79615.

	- Throw ArgumentException from set_SelectedObjects if there's a
	null in the array.

	- Add GetTarget method which can be used to traverse up the
	GridItem.Parent chain.  It depends on the assumption that
	selected_objects for different GridEntries are always in the same
	order (a safe assumption).  Use this method and loop over all the
	selected objects in the entry when calling RemoveValueChanged and
	AddValueChanged.
	
	* GridEntry.cs: Make this handle multiple selected objects.
	.Value returns null if not all the selected objects share the same
	value.

﻿2006-10-12  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>
	* ToolStrip.cs, ToolStripButton.cs, ToolStripComboBox.cs,
	  ToolStripControlHost.cs, ToolStripItem.cs, ToolStripLabel.cs,
	  ToolStripProfessionalRenderer.cs, ToolStripProgressBar.cs,
	  ToolStripSeparator.cs, ToolStripSplitStackLayout.cs,
	  ToolStripTextBox.cs: Add accessibility, fix attributes/API and
	add additional functionality.

2006-10-12  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ErrorProvider.cs : new ToolTipWindow ctor sig.
	* HelpProvider.cs : new ToolTipWindow ctor sig.
	* ToolTip.cs : remove ToolTip param from Window sig since it is
	not used.
	* ToolBar.cs : add tooltip support.  Fixes #79565.

2006-10-12  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <rolfkvinge@ya.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: move the events in set_SelectedIndex to 
	after the call to HighlightIndex in order to avoid 
	possible recursion and subsequent problems with the call
	to HighlightIndex and include a range check in 
	set_HighlightIndex. Fixes #79588
	
2006-10-12  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <rolfkvinge@ya.com>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: When FirstDayOfWeek is default set firstday 
	to ui thread's settings instead of sunday. 
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Localize the day string. Fixes #79563

2006-10-12  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <rolfkvinge@ya.com>

	* DateTimePicker.cs
	* MonthCalendar.cs
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: rewrote DateTimePicker to fix bug #78364
	and implement missing functionality (selecting different parts 
	of the date and edit them individually with the keyboard).
	
2006-10-11  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (OnInvalidated): fix NRE relating to last change.

2006-10-11  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (SetWMStyles): make sure we include the MAXIMIZED
	atoms in _NET_WM_STATE here if the window is maximized.  We need
	to do this because we're *replacing* the existing _NET_WM_STATE
	property, so those atoms will be lost otherwise, and any further
	call to GetWindowState will return Normal for a window which is
	actually maximized.  Fixes #79338.

2006-10-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Special case for setting selection end to
	selection start, we basically kill the anchor.
	- some todo comments.

2006-10-11  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: switch to using an "invalid_region" to track which
	parts of the image buffer need updating.  This is more code than
	the simple fix from r66532.  That version just attempted to always
	fill the entire buffer on redraw, which turns out to be
	inefficient when invalidating small rectangles.  This version
	simply adds the invalid rectangle to the invalid region.  When we
	get any WM_PAINT message we see if it can be filled using the
	image buffer, and if it can't (if the paint event's clip rectangle
	is visible in the invalid region) we first fill the image buffer.
	So, the image buffer is still a cache, we just fill it lazily.

	* PaintEventArgs.cs: remove the SetClipRectangle method, we don't
	need it any longer.

2006-10-11  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (SetWindowPos): we need to update both position as
	well as size after calling XMoveResizeWindow.  This keeps us from
	ignoring future SetWindowPos calls.  Fixes the disappearing
	DateTimePicker in the ToolBarDockExample from bug #72499.

2006-10-11  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: reorder things a bit when it comes to
	resizing-causing-recalculation.  we were recalculating the
	document when our position was changed, which shouldn't happen.
	We only care about size changes.  Clear up some more redundant
	recalculation calls while I'm at it.  This makes the toolbar dock
	example snappy when you're just dragging toolbars around (since it
	causes a relayout whenever you move one.)

2006-10-11  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ToolBarButton.cs (get_Rectangle): this only returns
	Rectangle.Empty if Visible == false, or Parent == null.
	Parent.Visible doesn't matter.

2006-10-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs, PaintEventArgs.cs: "internal set { .. }" isn't loved
	by .net 1.1, so switch to an internal method instead.

2006-10-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (WM_PAINT): when a control is double buffered we draw
	initially to the ImageBuffer and then copy from there.  But when a
	parent control which has child controls is double buffered, the
	initial drawing doesn't encompass the entire ClientRectangle of
	the parent control, so we end up with uninitialized bits (this is
	easily seen by dragging the top toolbar in
	wf-apps/ToolBarDockExample to the right, quickly).  The fix is to
	manually set the ClipRectangle of the paint_event (only the one we
	use to populate the ImageBuffer) to ClientRectangle.  Fixes more
	of the nastiness in bug #72499.

	* PaintEventArgs.cs: Add an internal setter for ClipRectangle,
	which we use in Control.cs's WM_PAINT handling.

2006-10-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Finish off the autoscrolling stuff.

2006-10-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Cursor.cs: Apply a slightly different patch to the one suggested
	in #79609.

2006-10-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MenuItem.cs: Make sure to put the mdi child in the hashtable,
	not the parent form.
	* TextControl.cs: use difference in old line count vs new count to
	calculate how many lines were added, this takes into account soft
	line breaks properly.

2006-10-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* LinkLabel.cs: don't call MeasureCharacterRanges against a
	rectangle located at 0,0 and the size of the text.  Use
	ClientRectangle instead.  This fixes rendering of non-left aligned
	link labels.

2006-10-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: When we set the selection start position the
	caret.
	* TextControl.cs: Need to update the caret when we decrement it to
	zero.
	- Make sure that the selection_visible flag gets reset to false if
	the selection isn't visible.  Before this you could get it set to
	visible by changing the selection start, then changing the end to
	equal the start.

2006-10-09  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Don't update scrollbars when we aren't visible.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Only need to update scrollbars if being
	added to an expanded visible node or the root node.

2006-10-09  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (SendMessage): fix NRE.

2006-10-09  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Implement horizontal autoscrolling.
	* TextControl.cs: Add a movement types that allows moving forward
	and backwards without wrapping.

2006-10-09  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs : layout changes for wrapped LargeIcon labels
	with focus "expansion" of labels.  Fixes #79532 and then some.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs : add LineLimit to ListView label format
	when wrapping.

2006-10-09  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Set the default max values to MaxValue since
	we use the scrollbar for autoscrolling and the default value is
	100.  If we don't do this the caret won't keep up with typing
	after about 18 characters.
	* TextControl.cs: Make sure the selection is offset by the
	viewport x.  This fixes selection when using auto scrolling.

2006-10-07  Andreia Gaita <shana.ufie@gmail.com>
	
	* Form.cs: The active control should be selected after the 
	OnLoad so that any child control initialization that affects
	the selection is done. Fixes #79406

2006-10-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: This is perhaps a dangerous change, but it seems
	to have no evil effects.

	- Stop selecting StructureNotifyMask on non-toplevel windows.

	  The only way children should be resized is by using the SWF api,
	  and we already send WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED messages in those cases.
	  Toplevel windows can be interacted with via the window manager,
	  and so we keep the input mask there.

	  The other event StructureNotifyMask gives us (that we care
	  about) is DestroyNotify.  The code is already structured such
	  that it assumes we won't be getting a DestroyNotify event for
	  the window we pass to XDestroyWindow (which is what
	  StructureNotifyMask is supposed to guarantee.)  So, that code
	  shouldn't be affected by this either.

	- Stop selecting VisibilityChangeMask altogether.

	  We weren't doing anything with the resulting events anyway.
	
	This vastly reduces the number of X requests and events we see
	when resizing/laying out a large ui.

2006-10-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ScrollableControl.cs (DisplayRectangle): we need to take into
	account the DockPadding regardless of whether or not auto_scroll
	== true.  rework this slightly to this effect, and fix bug #79606,
	and part of #72499 (you can now see the drag handles and drag
	toolbars around).

2006-10-06  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.souceforge.net>

	* ListViewItem.cs: Collections of selected and checked items are now
	dynamically rebuilt. Whenever an item is (un)checked or (de)selected
	we mark the collection "dirty".
	* ListView.cs: Marked collections readonly. Modified UpdateSelection
	to only clear SelectedItems when a new item is selected and MultiSelect
	is enabled. CheckedItems and SelectedItems now subscribe to Changed
	event of ListViewItemCollection, and mark its list dirty whenever
	that event is fire. This allows us to return selected/checked items 
	in the same order as they are in the Items collection. This matches
	the MS behavior.

2006-10-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* NotifyIcon.cs (HandleMouseUp): only show the context menu on
	right mouse clicks.  Fixes bug #79593.

2006-10-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Splitter.cs: doh, fix splitters that don't want to cancel the
	movement when you drag them.  Also, impose the limits on the
	values we send to the SplitterMovingEvent.  Fixes #79598.

2006-10-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Ignore whether or not the scrollbar is enabled,
	since we use this for auto scrolling also.

2006-10-05  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridBoolColumn.cs: Nuke the code from ConcedeFocus.  I'm
	beginning to think that most datagrid column types don't need this
	method.  Fixes bug #79392.

2006-10-05  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: move back to a more lazy scheme for creating the
	CurrencyManager, so we aren't updating it every time you set
	either DataSource or DataMember.  Also, don't call
	RecreateDataGridRows if the currency manager hasn't changed.

2006-10-05  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: by the time the OnSelectionChangeCommitted event is
	emitted, SelectedIndex should already be updated.  Fixes bug
	#78929.

﻿2006-10-05  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripComboBox.cs, ToolStripControlHost.cs, ToolStripProgressBar,
	  ToolStripTextBox.cs: Initial commit.
	* ToolStripItem.cs: Fixes for OnLayout, BackColor, Parent.

2006-10-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs: We need to invalidate the tab control area when
	new ones are added (duh).

2006-10-03  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs (ProcessDialogKey): if the focused control is in this
	form and is a button, call its PerformClick method here.  Fixes
	#79534.

2006-10-04  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabPage.cs: Ignore setting of Visible, and add an internal
	method for setting the controls visibility.  TabPage's Visible
	property is a little strange on MS, this seems to make us
	compatible, and fixes cases where people set all the tab pages to
	visible.
	* TabControl.cs: Use the new internal setting on tab pages
	visibility.

2006-10-03  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs : raise Click on ComboTextBox clicks. Fixes #79555.

2006-10-03  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs : use is_visible instead of Visible to check if 
	scrollbars should be placed/sized.  Also some max_wrap_width
	love for LargeIcon view.  [Fixes #79533]

2006-10-03  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs :
	  Make set_TextAlign() do actually update the align. Fixed #78403.

2006-10-03  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: fix a crash when switching datasources if the
	vertical scrollbar is at someplace other than Value = 0.  Also,
	reduce the number of recalculation passes we do in SetDataSource
	from 2 to 1.

2006-10-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Move the if value the same bail check up, we
	don't want to empty the document if it is already empty, this
	seems to severly mess up the caret.  TODO: I should probably fix
	the empty statement to update teh caret somehow.

2006-10-03  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs, DataGrid.cs: some changes so that the
	incredibly hacky Windows.Forms FAQ autosize rows entry (it uses
	reflection, an internal row type, properties on said type, etc.)
	will work with our datagrid.  Fixes #79531.

2006-10-03  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Don't crash if a path is not accessible
	  (System.UnauthorizedAccessException). Fixes #79569.
	* MimeIcon.cs: Workaround for a Uri bug. Unix paths/files can have
	  a ':' too. Return unknown icon for those paths/files.

2006-10-03  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* ToolTip.cs: Fix rare, but possible, NRE on MouseEnter when 
	GetContainerControl returns null.

2006-10-02  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (GetWindowState): use hwnd.client_window in the
	call to XGetWindowAttributes instead of "handle".  fixes an X
	error using notifyicon after the NotifyIconWindow to Form base
	class switch.

2006-10-02  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (QueryPointer): new function, encapsulating the
	server grab and looping we need to do to get down to the most
	deeply nested child window.
	(SetCursorPos): use QueryPointer instead of GetCursorPos, and call
	QueryPointer again after the WarpPointer so we can generate a
	proper (fake) MotionNotify event to be enqueued in the destination
	window's queue.
	(GetCursorPos): call QueryPointer.

	Fixes #79556.

2006-10-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* NotifyIcon.cs: Derive the notify icon from a form, so things
	like FindForm work on it.
	- Swallow the WM_CONTEXTMENU message, since that is generated on
	mouse down, and context menu is a mouse up kinda guy.  I believe
	the correct fix here is probably to make the notify icon entirely
	NC area, but this seems to work fine for anyone not manipulating
	WndProc.

2006-10-02  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStrip.cs, ToolStripButton.cs, ToolStripItem.cs,
	  ToolStripItemCollection.cs, ToolStripLabel.cs,
	  ToolStripProfessionalRenderer.cs, ToolStripRenderer.cs,
	  ToolStripSeparator.cs, ToolStripSplitStackLayout.cs:
	  Initial implementation.
	* TextRenderer.cs: Provide padding to MeasureText.

2006-10-02  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* ButtonBase.cs: Fix CreateAccessibilityInstance to return an instance
	of ButtonBaseAccessibleObject. Fix bug #79552.

2006-10-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiWindowManager.cs: When maximizing use the containers client
	rect, not it's bounds, so nc area is accounted correctly.
	- Use the parent form's size for the menu position, since the
	client isn't always the full form size.

2006-10-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ScrollableControl.cs: make sure neither right_edge or
	bottom_edge are < 0, since they're used as LargeChange for the
	horiz/vert scrollbars respectively.  Fixes #79539.

2006-10-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* NotifyIcon.cs: add NotifyIconWindow.InternalRecreateHandle, so
	the xplatuix11 code can cause us to destroy/recreate our handle.

	* XplatUIX11.cs
	(SystrayAdd):
	- this code can be invoked many times for the same Hwnd.  Make
	  sure we only destroy the client window once (the first time this
	  method is called).  This fixes bug #79544.
	- Remove the call to the improperly bound XSync.  why we had two
	  bindings to this, I will never know, but this call resulted in
	  events being discarded from the queue(!).
	- correct a misunderstanding of _XEMBED_INFO - the second atom is
	  not our current state but the state we wish to be in.  So, 0 if
	  we don't want to be mapped.  Change it to 1.
	(SystrayRemove): The XEMBED spec makes mention of the fact that
	gtk doesn't support the reparent of client windows away from the
	embedder.  Looking at gtksocket-x11.c seems to agree with this.
	The only avenue we have for removing systray icons is to destroy
	them.  We don't want the handle to go away for good, though, so
	call InternalRecreateHandle on the NotifyIconWindow.  Fixes
	#79545.
	
2006-10-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs (WndProc): inline the native_enabled variable usage into
	the cases in which it's used.  Fixes #79536.

2006-09-29  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs : toggle the selection state for ctrl clicks in 
	multiselect mode. [Fixes #79417]

2006-09-29  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs : kill CanMultiSelect and refactor the selection
	code to support multiselection in the absence of mod keys. Steal
	arrow/home/end keys by overriding InternalPreProcessMessage to
	restore regressed keynav behavior.
	[Fixes #79416]

2006-09-29  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Repaint the titlebars when the active window is
	changed.

2006-09-29  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Application.cs: when entering a runloop with a modal, make sure
	the hwnd is enabled.  Fixes #79480.

2006-09-29  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs (CurrentCell): if we try to navigate to the add row
	when ListManager.CanAddRows == false, bump us back one.

	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs (ParentReadOnly): remove the
	listmanager.CanAddRows check.  This makes ArrayLists uneditable
	using a datagrid, which is not right.
	(SetColumnValueAtRow): call IEditable.BeginEdit if source[rowNum]
	is an IEditable, but call property_descriptor.SetValue regardless.
	fixes #79435.

2006-09-29  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridBoolColumn.cs: we need to test equality in the face of
	possible null values (as is the case with the default NullValue).
	This patch keeps us from crashing in that case.

2006-09-29  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Don't do a recalculate/updatescrollbars
	here, since it will get called for every node collection in the
	tree. This is now done in the treeview once the sorting is
	finished.
	* TreeView.cs: Recalculate the visible order, and update the
	scrollbars after sorting, set the top nope to the root so that the
	recalc actually works.

2006-09-29  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* LinkLabel.cs: more handling of the default link collection in
	the face of LinkArea manipulation.  The default link collection
	contains 1 element (start=0,length=-1).  If the user sets LinkArea
	to anything and the links collection is the default, clear it.
	Then only add the link if its nonempty.  Fixes #79518.

2006-09-29  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* LinkLabel.cs (CreatePiecesFromText): calculate the length of a
	piece correctly when we hit a '\n'.  Fixes #79517.

2006-09-29  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs, ThemeGtk.cs, X11DesktopColors.cs, XplatUIX11GTK.cs:
	change the binding of gdk_init_check to take two IntPtr's, and
	pass IntPtr.Zero for both of them.  Fixes #79520.

2006-09-29  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs : raise TextChanged on ComboTextBox.TextChanged.
	[Fixes #78779]

2006-09-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: When translating NC messages make sure we go from
	whole window to screen, not client window to screen.
	* MdiClient.cs: Remove the calls to PaintWindowDecorations, this
	method doesn't exist
	- Skip over controls that aren't forms when arranging.

2006-09-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Clip the rect to the parent window.
	* XplatUIStructs.cs: Add clipping modes struct.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: New private method that factors title
	bar heights in when calculating the pos of an NC mouse message.
	- Use SendMessage to force a paint when the form's size is changed
	instead of painting the decorations immediately.
	- Don't let the NC button click messages get to DefWndProc,
	because they will attempt to handle windowing themself, and this
	messes up z-order (it will put them in front of the scrollbars).
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Make sure that we don't reset window managers if
	we already have one (ie the window is an MDI window).

2006-09-28  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* MainMenu.cs: fix #79405 by way of a disgusting hack.  all the
	menu code really needs going over.

2006-09-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (SetWMStyles): more metacity wonderment.  turns
	out metacity ignores the MAXIMIZE_HORZ/VERT messages unless the
	window is maximizable.  So, we need to make sure that even if we
	clear the border/wm frame of those functions, they're still
	available (basically, we remove the decoration without removing
	the function).  Half the fix for #79338.

2006-09-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs (ProcessGridKey): implement Shift-Tab handling.
	Fixes bug #79515.

2006-09-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Splitter.cs: reorder things a bit so that we don't actually
	draw/move the splitter until after calling OnSplitterMoving.  This
	lets users cancel/disallow the movement by explicitly setting
	event.SplitX/SplitY.  Fixes #79372.

2006-09-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Don't hide the caret when it is being destroyed,
	because it is most likely on a window being destroyed, and that
	will give us an X11 error.

2006-09-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: half of the fix for #78190.  Clicking on
	the dropdown button now toggles between showing and hiding the
	dropdown.  Also, get rid of dropdown_form_showing and just use
	dropdown_form.Visible.  We still don't do a grab, but I'll leave
	that part to someone who has handled Capture-fu before.

2006-09-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: return false if alt isn't pressed when '0' is
	pressed.  this keeps the '0' key from being swallowed, and fixes
	bug #79350.

2006-09-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: use Invalidate when scrolling the dropdown list.
	Calling Refresh (in response to a scrollbar event) screws up the
	scrollbar painting.  Fixes bug #78923.

2006-09-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Theme.cs (SystemResPool): make the "if hashtable[key] == null
	then insert into hashtable" blocks threadsafe.

2006-09-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* MessageBox.cs (CreateParams): the styles should be |'ed with our
	baseclass's, since otherwise the
	ControlBox/MinimizeBox/MaximizeBox assignments above have no
	effect.  This gets the close button back in messageboxes.

2006-09-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: make StyleSet and ExStyleSet check == with the
	flag, not just != 0.  this makes flags that are actually multiple
	bits (like WS_CAPTION) work.  fixes bug #79508.

2006-09-27  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* PageSetupDialog.cs: add support for getting and settings the 
	paper size, source and orientation.

2006-09-26  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (SetWMStyles): turns out when SYSMENU is not set
	and caption == "", we need to remove the resize handles as well as
	the title bar.

	* Control.cs (set_Text): turns out that setting Text on a form
	should change the WM styles on the window, since if ControlBox ==
	false, the only way to get a window border is to have a non-""
	Text property.  check winforms/forms/text.cs for an example.  so,
	call both XplatUI.SetWindowStyle and XplatUI.Text here to properly
	update both window styles and title.  This fixes a lot of dialogs
	(including the preferences dialog in MonoCalendar.)

2006-09-26  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs (SetParent): if parent == IntPtr.Zero (and the
	control isn't a Form), call Win32ShowWindow to hide the window,
	but don't update the control Visible property.  When we reparent
	back to a parent control, call SetVisible in order for the
	window's visibility to be reinstated.

	* XplatUIX11.cs (SetParent): if hwnd.parent == null, reparent to
	the FosterParent.

	* Control.cs (ControlCollection.Remove): remove that value.Hide()
	call for good, since it breaks MonoCalendar (and other things I'm
	sure.) Also, set all_controls to null *after* the owner calls,
	which end up regenerating it.
	(ChangeParent): allow new_parent to be == null, passing
	IntPtr.Zero down to XplatUI.

	this fixes #79294 the right way.

2006-09-26  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* GridEntry.cs : internal SetParent method.
	* PropertyGrid.cs : attach to property changed on the proper
	target if we have a hierarchical grid with subobjects. Setup
	GridItem.Parent for hierarchical items.
	* PropertyGridView.cs : Set value on the correct target for
	hierarchical grids. [Fixes #78903]

2006-09-26  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (ChildNeedsRecreating): this should return true if
	either we're being recreated and the child is in our list, or our
	parent is waiting for our recreation.

2006-09-26  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (ControlCollection.Remove): reinstate the
	value.Hide() call as suggested in bug #79294.

2006-09-26  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Fixed SetCursorPos to move the cursor to screen
	coordinates (versus a relative move).

2006-09-26  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: rework child recreation a little bit.  It turns out
	that we race between the DestroyNotify the WM_DESTROY message.  If
	the parent gets its DestroyNotify before the child gets the
	WM_DESTROY message, the child ends up not recreating (since the
	parent finishes its recreation on DestroyNotify, and the child
	checks ParentIsRecreating.)

	So, instead we store off a list of all the child controls which
	need to be recreated when the parent control starts to recreate
	itself.  Then, when child controls get their WM_DESTROY message we
	check to see if they're in the parent's pending recreation list,
	and if so, we recreate.  This removes all dependency on ordering
	from the code and fixes the initial MonoCalendar upgrade dialog.

	* TextControl.cs: Use the Line to get the length of the line,
	since soft line breaks can change the end line.

2006-09-26  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (ControlCollection.AddImplicit): don't add the
	control again if it's already in one of our lists.  This keeps us
	from adding controls over and over again for comboboxes when their
	handle gets recreated (as the combobox adds implicit controls in
	OnHandleCreated).  Fixes the X11 errors in bug #79480.

2006-09-26  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: When deleting characters make sure that any
	orphaned zero lengthed tags get deleted.
	- Fix ToString for zero lengthed tags.

2006-09-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: When getting a tag at the location there can be
	multiple tags at the same spot, these are 0-lengthed tags that
	appear when extra formatting has been stuck in a location.  We
	need to pull out the last of these 0 lengthed tags.

2006-09-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Fix print out in debug method.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: When text is set bail if we are setting to the
	previous value.
	
2006-09-24  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FontDialog.cs: Fixed the up/down arrow keys issue from bug #79478.
	  It is now possible to change the selected index in a FontXXXListBox
	  with the up and down arrow keys from the FontXXXTextBoxes.
	  Also, send the FontXXXTextBox mouse wheel event to the corresponding
	  FontXXXListBoxes to match ms.

2006-09-22  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SystemInformation.cs: Return a clone of the theme's MenuFont because
	anyone can dispose it, anytime. All other properties returns enums, 
	structs or basic types so they don't need such tricks.

2006-09-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUI.cs:
	* XplatUIWin32.cs:
	* Clipboard.cs:
	* DataFormats.cs:
	* XplatUIOSX.cs:
	* XplatUIDriver.cs: Update interface to add a primary selection
	flag, so the driver can use the primary selection buffer if
	needed.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Allow the clipboard to retrieve from PRIMARY.

	* RichTextBox.cs: We need to supply the data object to paste now
	(so we can choose to supply CLIPBOARD or PRIMARY).
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Supply data object to paste (see above).
	- Middle click uses the primary selection data object.
	
2006-09-21  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: first little cleanup of the StyleSet (...) block
	of SetWMStyles.  It's still a rat's nest and is largely
	order-dependent which I dislike immensely.  This also fixes the X
	button disappearing from toplevel forms.

2006-09-21  Mike Kestner <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListBox.cs: move Jordi's click/dblclick raising code to the
	mouse up handler.

2006-09-21  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Fixes 79450

2006-09-21  Mike Kestner <mkestner@novell.com>

	* TreeView.cs: guard against disposed conditions in UpdateScrollbars
	to deal with people updating the TreeNodeCollection after the tree
	is disposed.  "Fixes" 79330.

2006-09-20  Jackson Harper <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Push the cursor record onto the undo stack
	before the delete action. This fixes 78651.

2006-09-20  Jonathan Chambers  <joncham@gmail.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: Remove WindowStyles.WS_VISIBLE from
	CreateParams. Fixes 79329.

2006-09-19  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: a couple of blanket code massage passes to clean
	things up a bit.  First, get rid of the NetAtoms array (and the NA
	enum), and just embed the atoms as static fields.  Also, add a
	couple of functions (StyleSet and ExStyleSet) to clean up all the
	bitmask testing of styles.

	* X11Structs.cs: remove the NA enum, not needed anymore.
	
2006-09-19  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: apply Alexander's tool window fix for bug #79245
	(mapping them to _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_UTILITY).  and add a little
	added cleanup to get MessageBox titles appearing again, which were
	broken by my earlier fix for caption-less/ControlBox-less windows.

﻿2006-09-18  Jonathan Pobst <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* ToolStripArrowRenderEventArgs.cs, ToolStripArrowRenderEventHandler.cs,

	* ToolStrip.cs, ToolStripItem.cs: Stub a few variables/properties for above.

2006-09-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	- make the MessageQueues hashtable Synchronized.
	
	- SendMessage: if the Hwnd is owned by a different thread, use the
	AsyncMethod stuff to dispatch the SendMessage on the hwnd's
	thread.  Fixes bug #79201.

2006-09-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (SetWMStyles): rework the #79368 fix slightly.  If
	ControlBox == false, we disallow maximize/minimize/close.  If the
	form Caption is "" we also disallow move (and get rid of the Title
	decoration).  Unfortunately, regardless of how things are set,
	we're stuck with the Title and WM menu.

2006-09-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Application.cs: add locking around the static message_filters
	ArrayList, part of #79196.

2006-09-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (SetWMStyles): if Form.Text == "" and
	Form.ControlBox == false, the window has no titlebar nor resize
	handles.  fixes bug #79368.

2006-09-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: in CalculateScrollBars make sure LargeChange is
	>= 0.  Fixes bug #79370.

2006-09-15  Jonathan Pobst <monkey@jpobst.com>
	* FlowLayoutPanel.cs, FlowLayoutSettings.cs: Initial commit.
	* Control.cs:
   	    Add properties: LayoutEngine, Margin, DefaultMargin.
   	    Add method: GetPreferredSize.
   	    Move layout logic from PerformLayout to layout engines. 

2006-09-13  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: more destroy work.  Jackson pointed out that my
	fix for #79326 broke #78718, so this change addresses that.

	- in SendWMDestroyMessages remove the call to
	CleanupCachedWindows, since we might be recreating the control and
	need to maintain the references to right Hwnd handles.  Also, set
	the zombie flag to true for each of the children in the hierarchy
	instead of calling hwnd.Dispose.  This will cause GetMessage to
	ignore all events for the window except for DestroyNotify.

	- In GetMessage, ignore messages except for DestroyNotify for
	zombie hwnds.
	
	* Control.cs: revert the is_recreating fix from the last
	ChangeLog.  It's definitely "right", but it breaks switching from
	an MDI form to a non-MDI form.  Will need to revisit that.

	* Hwnd.cs: add a zombie flag, which means "the
	client_window/whole_window handles are invalid, but we're waiting
	for the DestroyNotify event to come in for them".  Set the flag to
	false explicitly if setting WholeWindow/ClientWindow, and also
	when Disposing.
	
2006-09-13  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: rework window destruction slightly.

	- when destroying the windows associated with a control, we don't
	need 2 separate XDestroyWindow calls.  Just the one for the
	whole_window (or for client_window if whole_window is somehow
	IntPtr.Zero -- can this happen?) is enough.

	- reworked SendWMDestroyMessages slightly, so we always dispose
	the child control hwnd's after sending the messages.
	
	- refactored out the ActiveWindow/FocusWindow/Caret clearing from
	the two places it was used (one was even using hwnd.Handle and the
	other hwnd.client_window.  ugh), adding another call in
	SendWMDestroyMessages.  We need this new call because now the
	DestroyNotify events in the queue will be ignored for the child
	controls (as their hwnd's were disposed, and the window id's
	removed from the hashtable in SendWMDestroyMessages.) fun, eh?

	- this fixes bug #79326.

2006-09-13  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: don't always set is_recreating to false at the end
	of RecreateHandle, since sometimes we're not done (and won't be
	until WndProc handles the WM_DESTROY message).  Also, set
	is_recreating to false in the WM_DESTROY handling code.  Part of
	the fix for bug #79326.

2006-09-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* X11DesktopColors.cs: Start the droppage of debugging messages.

	* FileDialog.cs: Store the configuration file in ~/.mono/mwf_config

2006-09-13  Jonathan Pobst <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* SplitContainer.cs, SplitterPanel.cs: Initial implementation [2.0].

2006-09-12  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs (get_ListManager): if the list_manager is null, try
	to create it using SetDataSource.  Fixes bug #79151.

2006-09-11  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XEventQueue.cs: add a DispatchIdle property.

	* XplatUIX11.cs (UpdateMessageQueue): only emit the Idle event if
	either the queue is null, or the queue has DispatchIdle set to
	true.
	(DoEvents): set queue.DispatchIdle to false around the
	peek/translate/dispatch message loop in this method.  This keeps
	Application.Doevents from emitting idle events.  Part of the fix
	for #78823.

2006-09-11  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs (set_DataSource): make this work for both the
	winforms/datagrid test and ReportBuilder.  It seems as though when
	we've created a ListManager (or maybe it's if we have a
	BindingContext?), when we set the DataSource it clears the
	DataMember to "".  otherwise we reuse the datamember.  Fixes bug
	#79333.

2006-09-11  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: deal with queue being null, which happens in all
	the Clipboard functions.  Fixes one of the two problems mentioned
	in #78612.

2006-09-11  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: rework OnMouseUp a bit so that releasing the mouse
	button on various spots (including outside the menu) works closer
	to MS, and doesn't crash.  Fixes #79343.

2006-09-11  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ListView.cs: Do not initialize item_sorter in init. To match MS,
	return null for ListViewItemSorter if View is SmallIcon or LargeIcon
	and the internal comparer is set. When a new ListViewItemSorter is set,
	sort the items. Use Enum.IsDefined to verify whether a valid SortOrder
	was specified. No further processing is necessary if SortOrder is set
	to it's current value. If Sorting is modified to None, and View is
	neither SmallIcon nor LargeIcon then: on 2.0 profile set item_sorter
	(either custom or our internal ItemComparer) to null, on 1.0 profile
	only set item_sorter to null if its our internal IComparer. If Sorting
	is modified to Ascending or Descending, then use our internal IComparer
	if none is set, and if the current IComparer is our internal one then:
	on 2.0 profile always replace it with one for new Sorting, and on 1.0
	profile only use new Sorting if view is not SmallIcon or LargeIcon. Use
	Enum.IsDefined to verify whether a valid View value is specified in
	its setter. Automatically sort listview items when listview is
	created. In Sort, do nothing if ListView is not yet created, or if
	no item_sorter is set (no Sorting was set, Sorting was explicitly set
	to None or ListViewItemSorter was set to null). Added Sort overload
	taking a bool to indicate whether the ListView should be redrawn when
	items are sorted (we use this in ListViewItemCollection to avoid double
	redraws). Modified our internal IComparer to take the sort order into
	account. In Add and AddRange methods of ListViewItemCollection, also
	call Sort if Sorting is None (necessary for SmallIcon and LargeIcon
	view), but use overload with noredraw option to avoid double redraw.
	On 2.0 profile, throw NotSupportedException when setting CheckBoxes to
	true when View is Tile, and do the same when attempting to set View to
	Tile when CheckBoxes is true. Avoid maintaining separate ArrayLists
	for selected/checked indices, as it involves overhead when sorting is
	done while these collections are not used all that often. Instead
	we'll build the indices on demand. Modified IList implementation of
	CheckedIndexCollection to use public methods if object is int.
	Modified CheckedListViewItemCollection to hide checked items if
	ListView.CheckBoxes is false. Removed LAMESPEC remark in 
	ListViewItemCollection as the .NET SDK docs have been fixed. Modified
	IList implementation in SelectedIndexCollection to use public methods
	if object is int. Modified SelectedListViewItemCollection to hide
	selected items if listview is not yet created.
	* ListViewItem.cs: CheckedIndices list no longer needs to be
	maintained separately (see ListView changes). Also clone font, fixes
	test failure.

2006-09-11  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: if we are updating the contents of the currently
	selected index, refresh the control or the textbox selection.
	[Fixes #79066]

2006-09-11  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs (UpdateBounds): use SetBounds not SetBoundsCore since 
	the 'specified' logic has been moved there.  This seems like a bug 
	in Control.cs, since our current SetBoundsCore completely ignores 
	the specified parameter.  Peter's commit seems to indicate that is 
	the way the MS control implementation works.  [Fixes #79325]

2006-09-10  Jonathan Chambers  <joncham@gmail.com>

	* XplatUI.cs: Set default_class_name to be composed
	of current domain id. This allows MWF to be loaded in multiple
	domains on Win32.

2006-09-09  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* X11Keyboard.cs: If we are unable to obtain the input method, do
	not call CreateXic to create the input context.   Should fix
	#78944/79276.

2006-09-08  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: Rewrote major parts. Dropped KDE support for now.
	  Simplified gnome support by adding more pinvokes to get the
	  icon for a file or mime type.

2006-09-08  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Deslect popup context menu items before closing the
	window, so that you don't see the previously selected item
	selected when you reopen the menu.
	* TextControl.cs: Update the cursor position even if we don't have
	focus.  This fixes typing in things like the ComboBox.  I'm not
	totally sure we should always set the visibility if we don't have
	focus, but couldn't find any corner cases where the cursor showed
	up when it shouldn't.

2006-09-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* X11Keyboard.cs: In UpdateKeyState vkey can be any integer, but
	our arrays are length 256.  & 0xff before indexing.  Fixes the
	crash in bug #78077.
	
2006-09-08  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: 
	* DateTimePicker.cs: Draw check box if DateTimePicker.ShowCheckBox
	is true. Handle that check box too.

2006-09-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: move the PerformClick call to OnMouseUp.  Fixes bug
	79244.

2006-09-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: in set_BackColor only do the work if
	background_color != value.

	* XplatUIX11.cs: move the clearing of invalid areas (both client
	and nc) to the same block of code where we set (nc_)expose_pending
	to false.  That is, move it from PaintEventEnd to PaintEventStart,
	so things that cause invalidates from within OnPaint will trigger
	another call to OnPaint.  Fixes bug #79262.

2006-09-07  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* Theme.cs: Use correct icon for UIIcon.PlacesPersonal
	* FileDialog.cs: Fix typo

2006-09-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:  oops, forgot to commit.  Draw the images
	for tab pages if they have any.

2006-09-06  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Splitter.cs: use the "current" rect when finishing drag handle
	to avoid an artifact demonstrated by resedit.exe.  [Fixes #79251]

2006-09-06  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Splitter.cs: draw the drag handle at X or Y instead of 0 to deal
	support offset splitters. [Fixes #79298]

2006-09-06  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* Mime.cs: Fixed a bug that could override the global mime type
	  result.

2006-09-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Better calculation method for setting the slider
	pos. Prevents crashes on really wide tabs.
	- Draw Image on tab pages if an image list is used.

2006-09-02  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: When Font changes, the Size should be
	updated to fit the new font's space requirements.

2006-09-02  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: If the items are cleared with Items.Clear set
	  top_index to 0.

2006-09-01  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: Handle arrow keys as input keys. Also
	fire DateChanged event instead of DateSelected event when
	the date was changed by keyboard interaction.

2006-09-01  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* DateTimePicker.cs: Handle DateChanged for the associated
	month_calendar control, and set month_calendar.Font from 
	OnFontChanged method, as well as resize the height of the
	control when needed. Make PreferredHeight proportional.

2006-09-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: grr, stop overthinking the DataMember/DataSource
	properties.

	* BindingContext.cs (HashKey.GetHashCode): use ^ instead of +.

2006-09-01  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* FileDialog.cs: Set ClientSize instead of window size, to allow space
	  for decorations (Fixes #79219)

2006-09-01  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: first stab at sorting plus some selection handling
	fixes to bring us more in line with MS behavior.  Also switches back
	to index based selection.  Alternative patches for index-based 
	selection were provided by Jackson Harper, Carlos Alberto Cortez, 
	and latency@gmx.de on bug 78848.  I assume they were similar to this
	code I've had simmering in my tree forever.
	[Fixes #78848]

2006-09-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* CurrencyManager.cs (ListChangedHandler): in the ItemAdded case,
	when setting list position guard against ending up with a -1 index
	(the other part of the fix for #78812).  Should probably make sure
	we don't need the analogous fix in the ItemDeleted case.

	* DataGrid.cs:
	- in SetDataSource, work around the fact that the way
	OnBindingContextChanged is invoked will cause us to re-enter this
	method.  I'll remove the hack once I investigate
	OnBindingContextChanged.

	- fix the logic in set_DataSource and set_DataMember (basically
	what to do if the other of the two is null.)
	
	- in OnListManagerItemChanged, we need to take into account the
	edit row when deciding whether or not to call RecreateDataGridRows
	(part of the fix for #78812).

2006-09-01  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Splitter.cs: Don't do anything if there is no control to affect
	(prevents us from crashing in weird tet cases).
	* TreeView.cs: Bounding box for the mouse movement reverting
	focus/selection back to previously selected node.  This matches
	MS, and makes the tree a lot more useable.
	* GroupBox.cs: Instead of drawing over the lines of the groupbox,
	use clipping so they are not drawn.  This fixes when the control
	is set to have a transparent background, or if it was over an
	image.

2006-09-01  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: Improved handling for reading default icons when
	  using gnome (2.16 made it necessary). Check and read svg icons
	  first, then 48x48 and then 32x32 icons.

2006-08-31  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs: only hide the textbox if it's still
	visible.

	* DataGridTextBox.cs: Pass Tab's up to the datagrid by calling
	ProcessKeyPreview.  Fixes part of #77806.

	* DataGrid.cs: big patch.

	- revert the queueing up of DataSource/DataMember if inside
	BeginInit/EndInit calls.  That's not the way the datagrid achieves
	its delayed databinding.  Instead, call SetDataSource in
	OnBindingContextChanged.  This mimic's MS's behavior, and fixes
	#78811.

	- Also, it wasn't mentioned in #78811, but the test case exhibits
	behavior that was lacking in our datagrid implementation - Columns
	that have mapping names that don't exist in the datasource's
	properties aren't shown.  Yuck.  To fix this I added the bound
	field to the column style, and basically any calculation to figure
	out anything about columns uses a loop to find the bound columns.
	still need to investigate if I can cache an array of the bound
	columns or if the indices must be the same.

	- When setting CurrentCell, we no longer abort if the cell being
	edited was in the add row.  This fixes the other part of #77806.

	- The new code also fixes #78807.
	
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: perpetrate the same disgusting
	column.bound field hack, and only render bound fields.

2006-08-31  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs: add bound field.  this field is true if
	the datasource has a property corresponding to the mapping name.

	* DataGridTableStyle.cs: set the bound field on the column styles
	depending on whether or not we have a column for that property.

2006-08-31  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Splitter.cs (SetBoundsCore): Don't ignore width/height of the 
	  splitter control (fixes #79228)

2006-08-31  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs: we need to delay the assignment of
	property descriptor until the last possible moment due to the lazy
	databinding stuff in the datagrid.  Also, fix the exceptions
	thrown by CheckValidDataSource to match MS.

2006-08-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: When activated select the active control, if there is
	no active control, we select the first control.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: If there is no focus control when we get a
	FocusIn event, find the toplevel form and activate it.  This
	occurs when you popup a window, it becomes the focus window, then
	you close that window, giving focus back to the main window.

2006-08-21  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: 
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Cache Font in bold style, as well
	as StringFormat with Center alignments in MonthCalendar,
	instead of creating new ones when drawing the control. 
	Also, draw the month name in bold style.

2006-08-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs:
	  - PerformLayout(): It would seem MS performs the fill even if the 
	    control is not visible (part of #79218 fix)
	  - ResetBackColor(): Use the setter to reset the color, to allow
	    overriders to catch the change.
	* Form.cs:
	  - .ctor: Call UpdateBounds to adjust client rectangle (part of #79218 fix)
	  - CreateHandle(): dito (part of $79218 fix)
	  - Don't set an icon if we have a dialog
	* ScrollableControl.cs:
	  - set_AutoScrollMinSize: Setting the property enables AutoScroll (#79218)
	  - ScrollIntoView(): No need to scroll if control is already visible
	    (resolves fixme and fixes #79218)

2006-08-30  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: Change proportions in SingleMonthSize
	to match the aspect of the original control.

2006-08-29  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Fix for a metacity/X problem where windows don't
	  get updated when they get maximized.

2006-08-29  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Handle windows with no border (Fixes part of #79160)

2006-08-29  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: when destroying the FocusWindow, send KILLFOCUS.

2006-08-29  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Need to track selected node and highlighted node,
	they aren't always the same thing, when the mouse is down on a
	node it is hilighted, but not selected yet.
	- Do the HideSelection stuff right
	- Need to focus on rbutton mouse down. And redraw selection when
	right click is mouse upped.

2006-08-29  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: draw selections for columns in FullRowSelect
	when SubItems.Count < Columns.Count.  [Fixes #79167]

2006-08-28  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextControl.cs (FindCursor): Fix math error (Fixes #78402)

2006-08-28  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Preempt the roundtrip for getting the location back
	  from X. Only send based on ConfigureNotify if we don't have the
	  correct location in hwnd (if the window manager moved us)

2006-08-28  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: remove a TODO. 
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: implement HideSelection support for ListView.
	[Fixes ListView part of #79166]

2006-08-28  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: move wheel handler to parent since it is focused
	instead of the item_control now.  [Fixes #79177]

2006-08-28  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: only highlight subitems in fullrowselect
	when the control is focused. [Fixes #79171]

2006-08-28  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: size the item and header controls for empty and
	unscrollable views.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: draw disabled backgrounds.
	[Fixes #79187]

2006-08-28  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: remove unused "active_form" static field.

	* Hwnd.cs: lock around accesses to static windows collection.

	* Application.cs: lock threads in Exit ().

2006-08-28  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* NativeWindow.cs: lock around accesses to window_collection.
	
2006-08-28  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: err, fix this the right way, by locking on controls
	when using it.  not by making it synchronized.

2006-08-28  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: make the static "controls" field synchronized, as it
	gets updated from multiple threads.

2006-08-27  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: PostQuitMessage is thread-specific not app-specific.
	  Prevent other threads from exiting when calling thread sets quit state.
	* XEventQueue.cs: Added PostQuitState property

2006-08-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* AsyncMethodData.cs: add a slot for the window handle.

	* XplatUIX11.cs (SendAsyncMethod): send the event to the right
	window (the destination control's window, not the foster window).

	* Control.cs (BeginInvokeInternal): store the window's handle in
	the AsyncMethodData.
	

2006-08-27  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - PostQuitMessage: Removed resetting S.D display handle, we might have
	    another loop started after calling PostQuitMessage (Fixes #79119)
	  - Created destructor to reset S.D handle

2006-08-27  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs (SetCursor): Issue flush after setting the cursor (#79168)

2006-08-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs (Insert): Update the caret position even if we don't
	  have a handle yet, just don't call the driver in that case.
	* TextBoxBase.cs (set_SelectedText): Set the Start and End selection
	  to the end of the new selection text (Fixes #79184)

2006-08-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs (Activate): Only activate if the handle is created)
	* Control.c:
	  - Mark window as invisible when it's disposed
	  - Check if window handle is created when setting window visible, 
	    instead of relying just on the is_created variable
	  - Check if object is disposed when creating the control (Fixes #79155)

2006-08-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ScrollableWindow.cs (ScrollWindow): Don't actually perform layouting
	  when allowing layout again. Otherwise we re-generate the anchoring 
	  distance to the border again and actually alter what the user wanted
	  This is ugly, it'd be better if we used DisplayRectangle instead of
	  ClientRectangle for Control.UpdateDistances, but that causes us to
	  have other problems (initial anchoring positons would be wrong)
	  (Fixes #78835)

2006-08-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs:
	  - The size and location setters shouldn't go directly to 
	    SetBoundsCore, but to SetBounds, which triggers layout on the
	    parent, then calls SetBoundsCore. (Related to fix for #78835)
	  - SetBounds: Moved actual location update code into this function
	    from SetBoundsCore, to match MS. Added call to PerformLayout if
	    we have a parent (to trigger resizing of anchored parents if the 
	    child size has changed (see testcase for #78835) 
	* ListBox.cs, Form.cs: Call SetBounds instead of SetBoundsCore to match 
	  new control code
	* ScrollableControl.cs (CalculateCanvasSize): Use shortcut variable

2006-08-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Don't reset the DisplayHandle that's stored in
	  System.Drawing when a toplevel window gets closed; there might
	  be other toplevel windows belonging to the same app (Fixes #78052)

2006-08-26  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: After reading FileDialog settings from mwf_config
	  use Desktop prefix only if a real folder doesn't exist anymore.
	* FontDialog.cs: Added char sets.
	  It is now possible to select the font, size or style with the
	  textboxes.

2006-08-25  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@gmail.com>

	* PrintPreviewDialog.cs: Use assembly name constants.

2006-08-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs (ScrollWindow): Use clipping rectangle arg (prevents
	  scrollbar from whacking it's buttons)

2006-08-24  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ScrollableControl.cs: fix #78271.  There's a lot of misc stuff
	in this patch (aggregating setting Left/Top/Width/Height to
	setting Bounds on the scrollbars), but the crux of the fix is in
	Recalculate, where we scroll by the remaining scroll_position if
	we're hiding a scrollbar.  The 2*$5 reward in the comment is
	serious.

2006-08-24  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs:
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: If the form is made a non-mdi window we
	need to remove the form closed event so that closing forms works
	correctly.

2006-08-24  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Make IsRecreating internal so that the driver can
	check it
	- Temporarily remove the Hide when controls are removed, its
	making a whole bunch of things not work because visibility isn't
	getting reset elsewhere correctly
	* Form.cs: Need to do a full handle recreation when the mdi parent
	is set.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: If we are recreating handles don't dispose the
	HWNDs.  What was happening is the handles were being recreated in
	SendWMDestroyMessages, but then flow continued on in that method
	and destroyed the new handles.

2006-08-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: MdiClient is always at the back of the bus
	* Control.cs: When the order of items in the collection is changed
	we need to reset the all_controls array
	- do the same sorta setup thats done when adding a control when a
	control is set on the collection.

2006-08-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs (get_Text): Return an empty array if our document
	  is empty (fixes #79052)

2006-08-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: We should call IsInputChar on only on WM_CHAR but not
	  on WM_SYSCHAR messages (fixes #79053)

2006-08-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: fix flickering when scrolling vertically.

2006-08-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs (EndEdit): only invalidate the row header when we
	need to.

2006-08-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: fix the clip munging of the datagrid paint
	methods.  fixes the flicker when scrolling around.

2006-08-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* FileDialog.cs: Making sure the control is created before we get a 
	  chance to use it with BeginInvoke (Fixes #79096)

2006-08-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs (DataGridPaintRows): calculate the proper
	width to use when painting the rows.

2006-08-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Throw ArgumentException if a negative value is passed to SelectionLength
	  - Update the selection end if start is moved. end needs to be always
	    after start. (Fixes #79095)
	  - Track selection length; MS keeps the selection length even if start
	    is changed; reset on all other operations affection selection

2006-08-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Make sure both scrollbars get displayed and sized
	correctly when the other bar is visible.
	- Use the original clip rectangle for checking if the area between
	the two scrollbars is visible, not the viewport adjusted clipping
	rectangle.

2006-08-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Binding.cs: We don't use IsBinding because it requires the
	control to be created, which really shouldn't be necessary just to
	set a property on the control.

2006-08-21  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Some CB.ObjectCollection methods must throw
	ArgumentNullReferenceException when the argument is null.

2006-08-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Timer.cs: Track the thread that the timer is started in (NOT
	CREATED), this way messages for it will only be triggered on its
	queue.
	* XEventQueue.cs: Track the timers here, this makes timers per
	thread, like MS.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: The timers are moved to the XEventQueue.

2006-08-19  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: after further communication with pdb, we get the
	best of both worlds.  SetZOrder working for un-Mapped windows, and
	no X errors for un-mapped windows.

2006-08-19  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (SetZOrder): remove the if (!hwnd.mapped) check,
	as it was causing pdn toolbars to not have the correct stacking.

2006-08-18  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com> 

	* ListView.cs : guard against negative ClientArea.Width in scrollbar
	calculation.  Not sure why control should ever be setting a negative
	width though.  Fixes #78931.

2006-08-18  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Throw ArgumentNullException when adding/modifyng
	null items in ObjectCollection class.
	* ListBox.cs.: Likewise.

2006-08-18  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* ThemeNice.cs, ThemeClearlooks.cs : remove RadioButton_DrawFocus()
	  as the base method in ThemeWin32Classic should work fine.
	  Fixed bug #78607.

2006-08-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Binding.cs: When validating if the value entered doesn't convert
	properly reset to the old value.
	* RadioButton.cs: Don't fire click when we get focus.

2006-08-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Paint the selection on the directory combobox the
	same way as on MS. 

2006-08-17  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ErrorProvider.cs: Don't allow the error control to be selected.
	* Control.cs: Don't send the SetFocus messages, the control
	activation will do this, and if we do it blindly here validation
	does not work.

2006-08-17  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs:
	* ContainerControl.cs: Make validation events fire in the correct
	order.  TODO: For some reason the first validation event is not
	getting fired.

2006-08-17  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com> 

	* ComboBox.cs : some null guarding for ComboListBox.Scroll.

2006-08-17  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com> 

	* ComboBox.cs : implement scroll wheel support for popped-down
	state. Fixes #78945. 

2006-08-17  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Specify treeview actions (old patch that didn't get
	committed for some reason).
	- Don't let the mouse wheel scroll us too far.  Just want to make
	the bottom node visible, not scroll it all the ways to the top.

2006-08-17  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Mouse wheel events go to the focused window.

2006-08-17  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com> 

	* ComboBox.cs : don't do mouseover selection in simple mode.

2006-08-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: Fire the closing events for all the mdi child windows
	when a window is closed.  If the cancel args are set to true, the
	main window still gets the event fired, but it doesn't not close.
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Do this closing cleanup in a Closed
	handler, instead of when the button is clicked, so cancelling the
	close works correctly.
	* ComboBox.cs: Send the mouse down to the scrollbar.

2006-08-16  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: When passing 'null' to SelectedItem,
	set SelectedIndex to -1, to unselect items. This is the
	observed behaviour in .Net.

2006-08-16  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Overriding HandleClick to get clicks in spite of
	  MS flags saying there won't be any. (fixes #78800)
	* Control.cs (HandleClick): Made virtual

2006-08-16  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* PageSetupDialog.cs : use Yard-Pound units only in en-GB and en-US
	  cultures. Fixed bug #78399.

2006-08-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: Use the MdiClients MdiChildren property to access
	MdiChildren instead of creating the array from the child controls.
	* MdiClient.cs: Maintain a separate array of the mdi children, so
	that insertion order is maintained when the Z-order is changed.

2006-08-16  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com> 

	* ListView.cs : add an ItemComparer and default to it for sorting.
	Fixes #79076, but sorting needs a complete overhaul to be compat with
	MS.

2006-08-15  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs (SetZOrder): Fix debugging leftover (fixes #79080)

2006-08-15  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Hwnd.cs (Mapped): Properly traverse the tree

2006-08-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Binding.cs: fix PullData/SetPropertyValue.  We don't want to
	pass manager.Current.GetType() to ParseData.  It has to be the
	property type.  So, hold off doing the ParseData until we're in
	SetPropertyValue where we know the type.  This fixes the crash in
	#78821 but the textbox is still empty.

2006-08-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs:
	- when we're scrolling, only call Edit() again if the
	current cell is still unobscured. Fixes bug #78927.
	- when handling mousedown on a cell, ensure the cell is visible
	before calling Edit.
	- remove the properties from DataGridRow, and remove the
	DataGridParentRow class altogether.
	

2006-08-15  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs (set_Text): Don't use base.Text, instead just
	  fire OnTextChanged by ourselves. There's no point calling base,
	  we don't set the base value anywhere else. Fixes #78773.

2006-08-15  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Call CollectionChanged when modifying
	an item from Items indexer, to update the actual items
	in the list box.

2006-08-15  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* PrintDialog.cs: Small fixes for focus and a pair of checks,
	to match .Net behaviour.

2006-08-15  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (SetZOrder): Handle raising toplevel windows

2006-08-15  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: Handle BringToFront for toplevel windows (Fixes #78737)

2006-08-15  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* MessageBox.cs: Prevent potential NRE exception.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: AutoSize only applies if MultiLine is false. Fixes #78889

2006-08-14  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* MessageBox.cs: Calculate the owner of a messagebox, also make
	  it topmost. Fixes #78753

2006-08-14  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: A couple of fixes so that metacity will let us
	programmatically move windows.  first, set the PPosition hint as
	well as the USPosition hint.  Second include some code from pdb
	that sets the window type to NORMAL when we set the transient for
	hint.  This is because, in the absence of a window type, metacity
	thinks any window with TransientFor set is a dialog, and refuses
	to let us move it programmatically.  fascists.

2006-08-14  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: When setting normal hints, take into consideration
	  an different hints previously set so we don't delete them (fixes #78866)

2006-08-12  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ToolBarButton.cs: make Layout return a boolean, if something to
	do with the button's layout changed.

	* ToolBar.cs:
	- add another parameter to Redraw, @force, which all existing
	  calls set to true.
	- make the Layout function return a boolean which is true if the
	  layout has actually changed.  Redraw now uses this (and @force)
	  to determine when to invalidate.  At present the only place
	  where @force can be false is the call from OnResize, when
	  background_image == null.  So, resizing a toolbar when the
	  layout doesn't change results in no drawing.

2006-08-12  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: fix the bottom right corner painting.  had
	the VScrollBar and HScrollbar reversed.  oops.

	* DataGrid.cs: fix the logic that assigns sizes to the implicit
	scrollbars.  we were assigning them twice (once in
	Calc{Horiz,Vertical}Scrollbar, and once in CalcGridAreas),
	therefore causing two scrollbar resizes (and redraws?) to happen
	per grid resize.

2006-08-12  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ToolBarButton.cs: redraw the entire button if the theme tells us
	to.

	* Theme.cs: add ToolBarInvalidateEntireButton.

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: we don't need to redraw the entire toolbar
	buttons, just the border.

	* ThemeNice.cs: redraw the entire toolbar button since we need to
	draw the highlight image.

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs: the rounded corners of toolbar buttons mean
	we need to redraw the entire button (not just the border).

2006-08-11  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs (CalculateScrollbars): Set the proper thumb size
	  for vertical bars. Fixes the mismatches shown by #78513

2006-08-11  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: If a saved/remembered path doesn't exist
	  anymore, fall back to "Desktop".

2006-08-11  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Form.cs (CreateParams): Don't use Parent.Handle unless we have a
	  parent. It's apparently legal to not have one
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - SetZOrder: Don't try to set Z-Order on an unmapped window
	  - CreateWindow: 0,0 are legal coordinates for a window. don't move
	    it unless the coordinates are negative

2006-08-10  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListControl.cs: allow null for DataSource.  Clear DisplayMember
	when setting to null per msdn docs.  Fixes #78854.

2006-08-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Menu.cs, MainMenu.cs, MenuAPI.cs: get rid of most of the
	flickering by setting a clip rectangle on the Graphics when we
	need to redraw just a particular menuitem.  Also, rename "OnClick"
	to "OnMouseDown" to reflect what it actually is.
	
	* Form.cs: track the OnMouseDown change.

2006-08-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* CommonDialog.cs: Properly inherit the CreateParams from the form
	  and only change what we need. Fixes #78865

2006-08-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ToolBar.cs, ToolBarButton.cs: fix the redraw-on-highlight
	flickering in flat mode (and most of the flickering in general) by
	only invalidating the button border (and not the entire rectangle)
	when the state changes.  A couple of cases still flicker:
	ToggleButtons, and the dropdown arrow case when the user mouse
	ups.

2006-08-10  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* X11Keyboard.cs: Fixed handling of the Del key on the cursorblock
	  for german keyboards. Numlock state shouldn't affect the behaviour
	  of the Del key. Fixes bug #78291.

2006-08-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ListControl.cs: remove the items.Clear line from BindDataItems,
	as this is the first thing done by both subclasses in their
	SetItemsCore overrides.  Also, add a ItemChanged handler, and when
	passed -1, refresh the list.  This gets databinding working when
	the datasource is set on the list before the datasource is
	populated (as in wf-apps/ReportBuilder.)

	* ComboBox.cs: remove the argument to BindDataItems.  This call
	should really go away, and be initiated by the ListControl code.

	* ListBox.cs: same.

2006-08-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs (Document.ctor): Initialize caret so we don't crash
	  if no data is in the document when the control is displayed

2006-08-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Don't try moving the caret if we don't have a window
	  yes (fixes #78806)
	* TextControl.cs: 
	  - PositionCaret: Allow positioning of caret but don't call methods 
	    requiring a handle if the window isn't created yet
	  - CharIndexToLineTag: Fix ending loop early error. Lines is 1 based
	  - owner_HandleCreated: Don't position the caret, just update it's 
	    location. User might have already set a different position

2006-08-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Don't use the desktop as basis for foster-parented
	  windows. Screws up the returned coordinates for child windows. 
	  Fixes #78825. I'm hoping this doesn't break something, since the
	  code was explicitly put in 8 months ago, but no bug was attached.
	  Menus still seem to work properly.

2006-08-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: make BeginInit/EndInit actually do what they're
	supposed to do - delay data binding until the EndInit call.  Also,
	make the table style collection's CollectionChangeAction.Refresh
	work properly.

	* GridTableStylesCollection.cs: raise a CollectionChangeEvent
	(with action = Refresh) when a consituent table's MappingName is
	changed.

2006-08-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ToolBarButton.cs: in set_Text, call Parent.Redraw, not
	Invalidate, since changing the text can change the size of the all
	toolbar buttons.

2006-08-08  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Form.cs (AddOwnedForm): Still need to add the form to our listif
	  we don't have it yet

2006-08-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PrintControllerWithStatusDialog.cs: don't .Close() the status
	dialog, as this causes X errors later on, since we actually
	destroy the window.  Instead, .Hide() it.

2006-08-08  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Added focus reflection for popup window
	* XplatUIX11.cs: 
	  - Removed transient setting for non-app windows for now, not sure it
	    was needed
	  - Fixed logic checking if we have captions when deciding 
	    override_redirect, WS_CAPTION is two bits and a 0 check was not
	    sufficient
	  - Removed the WINDOW_TYPE stuff, it was unneeded and making things
	    complicated
	* Form.cs: 
	  - AddOwnedForm: Don't just add the form to the list, call the property
	    to ensure the driver is informed about the ownership as well
	  - CreateHandle: Set the TopMost status in the driver if we have an owner
	* XplatUI.cs: Fixed debug statement

2006-08-08  Jonathan Pobst <monkey@jpobst.com>
	* ButtonRenderer.cs, CheckBoxRenderer.cs, ComboBoxRenderer.cs
	  GroupBoxRenderer.cs, ProgressBarRenderer.cs, RadioButtonRenderer.cs,
  	  ScrollBarRenderer.cs, TabRenderer.cs, TextBoxRenderer.cs, 
	  TrackBarRenderer.cs: Make constructor private.
	* ProfessionalColors.cs, ProfessionalColorTable.cs: Fix misnamed properties.
	* ProfessionalColorTable.cs: Make properties virtual.

2006-08-06  Duncan Mak  <duncan@novell.com>

	* NumericUpDown.cs (Value): Don't call OnValueChanged if the value
	is not changing.

2006-08-04  Jonathan Pobst <monkey@jpobst.com>
	* ButtonRenderer.cs, CheckBoxRenderer.cs, ComboBoxRenderer.cs
	  GroupBoxRenderer.cs, ProfessionalColors.cs, ProfessionalColorTable.cs,
	  ProgressBarRenderer.cs, RadioButtonRenderer.cs, ScrollBarRenderer.cs,
	  TabRenderer.cs, TextBoxRenderer.cs, TextRenderer.cs, TrackBarRenderer.cs:
	  Initial import of new 2.0 classes.

2006-08-04  Jonathan Pobst <monkey@jpobst.com>
	* Application.cs: Add 2.0 VisualStyles properties.

2006-08-04  Jonathan Pobst <monkey@jpobst.com>
	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs,
	  XplatUIX11.cs: Create property to allow access to existing private
	  variable "themes_enabled"

2006-08-04 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ImageListStreamer.cs: generate the MemoryStreams with the exact BMP
	file size, as otherwise our class libraries fail using windows. Fixes
	bug #78759.

2006-08-04  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs:
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Move the toolwindow window manager creation into
	the X11 driver, this way on win32 we can let windows create/handle
	the toolwindows.

2006-08-04  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* PrintDialog.cs: Remove some redundant checks, add some others,
	clean some code, and move the focus to the text boxes when the
	values are incorrect.

2006-08-04  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FontDialog.cs: Remove Form.MinimumSize. It's not needed.

2006-08-03  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* NumericUpDown.cs: Setting the Minimum and Maximum is now
	  handled correctly. Fixes bug #79001.

2006-08-03  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* PrintDialog.cs: The "Copies" numeric up down must have
	set the Minimum property to 1; only if the value is bigger
	than 1, activate "Collate" check box. This is the behaviour of .Net.
	Also modify the Document elements only if it is not null.

2006-08-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Fix copyto to use the correct nodes
	length. (We have a larger array then actual node count).
		
2006-08-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Don't show selection by default.
	- The SelectAll isn't needed here, since the focus code should do
	that
	- DDL style lists to manual selection drawing, so when they
	get/lose focus they have to invalidate.

2006-08-03  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Don't always show all selections by default.

2006-08-03  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>
	* ControlUpdateMode.cs, DataSourceUpdateMode.cs,
	  HelpNavigator.cs, WebBrowserEncryptionLevel.cs:
	  Fixed various typos.

2006-08-03  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* Control.cs: Removing the controls in a ControlCollection with
	  Clear now hides the controls as expected. Fixes bug #78804. 

2006-08-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Revert previous focus patch, it breaks reflector.

2006-08-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Cleanup selection and focus with the combobox.
	This also eliminates some duplicated keyboard code, since now
	everything is handled by the main class.
	- Make list selection work on mouse up instead of down, to match
	MS.

2006-08-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Setting focus needs to go through the whole
	selection mechanism.

2006-08-02  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PrintPreviewDialog.cs: change MinimumSize to use
	base.MinimumSize so it works.

2006-08-02  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs:
	  - UpdateCaret: Added sanity check in case caret isn't defined yet
	  - Line.Delete: Now updating selection and caret markers if we're
	    transfering a node (Properly fixes #78323)
	  - SetSelectionEnd: Added sanity check
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Removed broken attempt to fix #78323

2006-08-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PrintPreviewDialog.cs: the CancelEventArgs stuff surrounding the
	Close() call is handled in Form, not here.

2006-08-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Theme.cs, ThemeWin32Classic.cs: fix the PrintPreviewControl
	layout/rendering.

	* PrintPreviewDialog.cs: add scrollbars, and add an image cache
	for sizes < 100% zoom.  The code now aggressively attempts to keep
	from calling document.Print (), and tries not to use the scaling
	g.DrawImage whenever possible (it still does if you scale to >
	100%, since usually that involves huge images).

	* PrintPreviewControl.cs: hook up the close button.

2006-08-01  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>
	* ColumnClickEventHandler.cs, DrawItemEventHandler.cs,
	  ItemChangedEventHandler.cs, ItemCheckEventHandler.cs,
	  ItemDragEventHandler.cs, LabelEditEventHandler.cs,
	  LinkClickedEventHandler.cs, LinkLabelLinkClickedEventHandler.cs,
	  MeasureItemEventHandler.cs, MethodInvoker.cs, PaintEventHandler.cs,
	  PropertyTabChangedEventHandler.cs, PropertyValueChangedEventHandler.cs,
	  SelectedGridItemChangedEventHandler.cs, ToolBarButtonClickEventHandler.cs:
	  Removed [Serializable] for 2.0 Event Handlers.

2006-07-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Make ShowSelection invalidate when changed.
	* TextControl.cs: Uncomment out the body of this method.

2006-07-31  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Use the correct cursor shapes for arrow and default
	  standard cursors.

2006-07-31  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Added internal property ShowSelection to allow controls
	  that embed TextBox and need selections visible even if textbox is not
	  focused to enforce that behaviour.
	* TextControl.cs (Draw): Use ShowSelection instead of has_focus to determine
	  selection drawing

2006-07-31  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs:
	  - Added new SetSelectionStart/SetSelectionEnd overloads
	  - Fixed viewport width assignment to be accurate
	  - Adjusted alignment line shift calculations to allow cursor on right
	    aligned lines to be always visible at the right border (like MS)
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - SetBoundsCore: Re-adjust caret location after resize (Fixes #78323)
	  - TextBoxBase_SizeChanged: recalculating canvas on size changes
	  - CalculateScrollBars: Use ViewPort size instead of window size, to
	    properly consider space occupied by the border and scrollbars 
	    (Fixes #78661)
	  - hscroll_ValueChanged, vscroll_ValueChanged: Fixed scroll 
	    calculations; no longer leaves artifacts
	  - CaretMoved: Adjusted window scrolling to match MS and fixed several
	    calculation bugs (Still missing right/center align calculations)

2006-07-31  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XPlatUIWin32.cs: Made ScrollRectEx a bit more flexible, and removed
	  use of both scroll rect and clip rect, as they do the same.

2006-07-31  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (WM_CHAR WndProc): 2.0 profile allows changing the key 
	  in the event handler (fixes #78912)

2006-07-31  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: use grid.RowsCount here instead of
	grid.ListManager.Count, since grid.ListManager might be null.
	This of course begs the question "why are we drawing rows for a
	grid with no list manager (and therefor no rows)?"  Fixes the
	crash in bug #78929.

2006-07-31  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* RelatedPropertyManager.cs: Don't always chain up to the parent
	ctor.  instead, call SetDataSource if the parent's position is !=
	-1.  Fixes the crash in #78822.

2006-07-31  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs (get_ListManager): use field instead of property
	accessors for datasource and datamember.
	(RowsCount): make internal again.
	(OnMouseDown): end edits before resizing columns/rows.
	(OnMouseUp): restart edits after resizing columns/rows.

2006-07-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Default cursor cannot be 0 or it will not get set.
	  This fixes the situation where the last set cursor is displayed
	  whenever the mouse is over scrollbars.

2006-07-30  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* PrintDialog.cs: Fix the behaviour of PrinterSettings and
	Document properties, as well as initial values.

2006-07-29  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs (SetBorderStyle): Setting both border
	  and ClientEdge results in a 3-pixel border, which is
	  wrong.

2006-07-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Fix the clear method.
	- Fix the Shrink also

2006-07-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Make sure the visible order is computed when we
	attempt to size the scrollbars (for trees that mess with the
	scrolling when they shouldn't.
	- Make sure to give the scrollbars valid values.

2006-07-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Move motion compression code to where it
	  has less performance impact

2006-07-26  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* UpDownBase.cs: When the control is selected make the child
	controls non selectable, so that a click on them won't do a
	focus/unfocus cycle.
	- Don't give focus to the text box when the spinner is selected.
	* XEventQueue.cs: Peek on both the x11 queue and the lock queue.

2006-07-26  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: add print preview rendering.  I'm not
	satisfied with this solution.  If the bitmaps are small, we should
	just cache them in the PrintPreviewDialog and draw them here.
	Also, the layout is broken for the 2-up and 3-up cases.

	* Theme.cs: add PrintPReviewControlPaint.

	* PrintPreviewDialog.cs: first pass implementation.

	* PrintPreviewControl.cs: first pass implementation.  No
	scrollbars yet.

	* PrintDialog.cs: only validate fields if that particular portion
	of the UI is enabled.  Also, set the document's controller to a
	PrintControllerWithStatusDialog wrapping the document's print
	controller.

	* PrintControllerWithStatusDialog.cs: if we're printing to a file,
	bring up a SaveFileDialog (i hope we don't want to match the
	behavior of the crappy windows file entry) and set the
	PrinterSettings.PrintFileName accordingly.

2006-07-26  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs: Add a field that disables auto selecting
	the next control in a container when the container is activated.
	* UpDownBase.cs: Don't select the text box when the up down is
	selected.

2006-07-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XEventQueue.cs: Added methods for peeking (used for compression
	  of successive events)
	* XplatUIX11.cs (GetMessage): We're now compressing consecutive
	  mouse move events (fixes #78732)

2006-07-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* UpDownBase.cs: Use an internal class for the textbox so that we
	can control focus.  the updown control should always have focus,
	if either the text area or the buttons are clicked.
	- Send the key messages to the textbox, since it never actually
	has focus
	- Activate and decativate the textbox caret.

2006-07-24  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Use the directed select when selecting a control,
	this way the container controls override will get called and the
	whole ActiveControl chain will get triggered.  TODO: probably need
	to make sure this gets done everywhere instead of the old
	Select(Control).
	* ContainerControl.cs: Implement the directed Select method to
	find and activate the correct child control.	
	
2006-07-22  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: use Control.MousePosition for NCLBUTTONDOWN in the menu
	menu handling code so that clicks without a grab work too.
	[Fixes #78914]

2006-07-22  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Enable the BackButton when dirstack has one element.
	  Added some small optimizations.

2006-07-21  Matt Hargett  <matt@use.net>

	* Control.cs: Implemented 2.0 MinimumSize/MaximumSize properties

2006-07-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs (GetNextControl): Fixes to make all of Jackson's unit 
	  tests pass and match MS in some strange border cases.

2006-07-21  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: handle drawing of the relation links and
	parent row buttons.

	* Theme.cs: change args to DataGridPaintParentRow.

	* DataGrid.cs: Don't use controls for the relation links and
	parent buttons, so we have to handle all their interactions in
	MouseMove, MouseDown, MouseUp, etc.  Also, store a lot more stuff
	when we're navigating through child tables, so we can reinstate
	selection, expanded state, current cell, etc.

2006-07-20  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ToolBar.cs: When we redraw a button, for whatever reason,
	there's no reason to redraw the entire toolbar.  Also, don't call
	Control.Refresh from within Redraw, as it's much heavier than
	Invalidate (which is really what we want).

2006-07-20  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs, CurrencyManager.cs, DataGridColumnStyle.cs,
	DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs, DataGridTextBox.cs,
	ThemeWin32Classic.cs, ListControl.cs: After staring at stack
	traces from within a debug IBindingList datasource
	(in mono/winforms/datagrid) for *days*, I've finally gotten things
	to work in a similar fashion.

2006-07-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Don't call Sort () when setting 
	the Sorted property to false (avoid an unnecessary sort).

2006-07-20  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListControl.cs: DataSource should throw an ArgumentException
	instead of a normal exception when the argument is not of the 
	correct type.

2006-07-20  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: add InternalPreProcessMessage to allow us to steal
	key events before MWF gets its paws on them.  Adapted from a
	suggestion by eno.
	* ToolBar.cs: add GotLostFocus handing for flat toolbars, with 
	up/down/left/right navigation. Override the new internal control
	method to steal the events since they never make it to WndProc.
	* ToolBarButton.cs: don't worry about pushed when setting hilight
	since the drawing code prefers pushed to hilight. Invalidate on 
	Hilight changes. Fixes #78547 and #78525.

2006-07-20  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* ScrollableControl.cs: Consider AutoScrollMinSize when calculating
	  the canvas size. Fixes #78868

2006-07-20  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Splitter.cs: Track requested split position until first layout
	  is performed. Fixes #78871

2006-07-20  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Application.cs: Removed code that forces 1.x for the version
	  number if the version started with 0. Not sure why that code was
	  there and I couldn't find any bugs that indicated we needed it.
	  Fixes #78869

2006-07-20  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Don't throw a NotImplementedException in
	  ResetDefaults(), just write some output to the console until it's
	  implemented. Fixes bug #78907 for now. Eliminated two warnings.

2006-07-19  Jonathan Chambers  <joncham@gmail.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: set StartPosition of drop down forms
	so they appear in correct initial spot.  Fixes #78190.

2006-07-19  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: use parent background color when drawing
	flat toolbars.  Restructure the conditionals to make sure non-flat
	non-Divider toolbars are filled too.  Fixes #78837.

2006-07-19  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Sort on collection changes even if the handle
	isn't created yet.  Fixes #78813.

2006-07-18  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* ListControl.cs: DisplayMember should never be null,
	and now we assign String.Empty when null is passed to it (this
	is the .Net way).

2006-07-17  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: restructure Font and subitem Font handling 
	to hold a specific font and refer back to owner on null.
	Fixes #78761.

2006-07-17  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ToolBar.cs: bandaid for side-effect of previous patch which was
	discarding explicit heights for non-AutoSize toolbars.  Need to
	extend my format tester to deal with AutoSize=false. Fixes #78864.

2006-07-15  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* LabelEditTextBox.cs:
	* TreeView.cs: Use a new LabelEdit class for node editing, this
	class automatically 'closes' itself when it gets the enter key or
	loses focus.
	- Use the client rectangle when setting the trees scrollbars, so
	border style is taken into account.
	
2006-07-14  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNode.cs:
	* TreeView.cs: Make the editing work similar to MSs, firing the
	events correctly and ending edits correctly.

2006-07-14  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ToolBarButton.cs:
	* ToolBar.cs: layout restructuring and redraw enhancements to support
	formatting changes gracefully, like setting TextAlign, ImageList, 
	ButtonSize, and Appearance.  Handles explicit button sizing quirks
	of the MS controls.  Things like flat toolbars ignoring button size
	but becoming constant sized at the largest button's size.  Normal
	toolbars with an image set cannot be shrunk smaller than the image,
	but text can be clipped/ignored.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: don't draw text if text_rect height or width
	is zero.  Seems like DrawString should be smart enough to not put
	anything on screen though. Also trim labels and ellipsize at the char
	boundary, not word.
	Fixes #78711 and #78483.

2006-07-14  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs: Disable "New Folder" button and
	  "New Folder" contextmenu menuitem if a folder like "My Computer"
	  is selected.

2006-07-14  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Don't create a new folder in "MyComputer" folder.
	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs:
	  - Use MWFConfig to store and read size and position settings
	  - Added code to create a new folder (button or context menu).
	    Use TreeView labeledit to change the name of the new folder.

2006-07-14  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Raise the OnAfterLabelEdit event correctly.  Also,
	when the tree is scrolled we end editing.

2006-07-14  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Fixed position of CPDrawScrollButton Up and
	  Down arrows

2006-07-13  Jonathan Chambers  <joncham@gmail.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: Fix keyboard navigation of drop down.
	Patch from eno for bug 78558.
	
2006-07-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: When an edit is finished make sure that the
	selected node is visible.
	- When setting the top/bottom use the scrollbars is_visible, so
	everything will be set correctly even if the tree isn't visible
	yet.

2006-07-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Revert the item->index part of my previous patch.
	* TreeView.cs: Use LostFocus instead of Leave for detecting when
	the edit box has lost focus (duh).
	- Just make the edit box not visible when we get return, that will
	take the focus, which will call EndEdit
	* TreeNode.cs When we start editing, notify the treeview.

2006-07-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Clear out old items before setting the item list.
	This prevents databound controls from having their items added
	twice.
	- Switch the combobox to use indices whereever possible instead of
	using Item's.  This allows usto navigate through lists that have
	more then one item with the same string value (ie a, b, b, a).
	- Scroll the listboxes scrollbar when a non visible item is
	highlighted
	- Allow keypress to cycle through all the possible values. For
	example if you have b1, b2, b3 and hold down the B key all the
	values will be cycled through.
	
2006-07-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	* ListView.cs: Don't need to override SETFOCUS anymore, we can do
	this using the internal methods.
	* Control.cs: Add OnGotFocusInternal.  A new method that allows
	controls to "override" OnGotFocus and change focus behavior if
	needed.
	- Same thing for LostFocus
	* ComboBox.cs: Pass off focus to the text control properly.

2006-07-12  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Added GetFoldersOnly to MWFVFS
	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs: Almost a complete rewrite.
	  - Better support for Environment.Specialfolders
	  - Added support for MWFVFS
	  - Made setting SelectedPath work

2006-07-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Optimze getting all the controls.

2006-07-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ContainerControl.cs: Override SETFOCUS in the container control,
	so that it is not selected on mouse click.

2006-07-11  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* LinkLabel.cs: Hack to handle Shift-Tabbing to the linklabel. 
	  Hopefully we will have a better way once all of focus is complete.

2006-07-11  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Commented out some debug code and fixed
	  a compile error with csc.

2006-07-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: When hiding a control only select the next control
	if the current control was focused.
	- Don't handle enter/leave when setting/killing focus, this is
	done by the container control.
	- Remove is_selected, it's not needed anymore.
	- Add utility methods for selecting a child control, and for
	firing the Enter/Leave events.
	* ContainerControl.cs: When a control is activated fire the
	enter/leave events.
	- Don't wrap when processing the tab key, so that focus can be
	moved outside of the container.
	- Use the correct active control

2006-07-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Remove some debug code that was blinding me.
	* UpDownBase.cs: These controls actually aren't implicit, they are
	visible to the user.

2006-07-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: move back to the is_adding boolean field.  god i
	hate this is_editing/is_adding/is_changing stuff.

2006-07-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridTableStyle.cs: just check if the property type is bool.
	if it is, use DataGridBoolColumn, otherwise DataGridTextBoxColumn.
	Don't use CanRenderType.

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs: set the value to DBNull.Value, not "",
	if our text == NullText.  Remove CanRenderType.

	* DataGridBoolColumn.cs: nuke CanRenderType.

	* DataGrid.cs: reenable some code to end the current edit inside
	of set_CurrentCell.  This fixes the other 1.1.16 regression.
	Also, remove rowhdrs_maxheight and just use rowhdrs_area.Height.
	Also, remove the visible_row_count arg from CalcRowHeaders, since
	we don't need to worry about the actual height of the area.

2006-07-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs: if when we Commit we're in navigate
	mode, just return.

	* DataGridTextBox.cs: change "isedit" to "isnavigating" to reflect
	the real sense of the IsInEditOrNavigateMode property (true =
	navigate, false = edit).  Also, update OnKeyPress to reflect this.

	* DataGridTableStyle.cs (CreateColumnsForTable): even if the
	column style exists, we still need to set its property descriptor
	to match up with our list manager.

2006-07-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: implement the new row/header painting
	approach.  The parent row painting will likely go away and
	replaced with label controls, but the rest seems to work ok (and
	efficiently).

	* Theme.cs: change the way we draw datagrid rows.  we don't draw
	the row headers as a block now.  Instead we draw them in the
	normal draw-row loop.  Add some calls for drawing parent rows and
	relation rows.

	* DataGridTableStyle.cs: add tons of ArgumentExceptions if this is
	a default table style.  Set the defaults from ThemeEngine.Current,
	not SystemColors.  Fix lots of misc issues with property setters.

	* DataGrid.cs: move loads of style information out of this class
	as it's being duplicated with DataGridTableStyle.  keep track of a
	special DataGridTableStyle for the properties we used to mirror
	here.  Switch all the style properties to access this table style
	instead of instance fields of this class.  Also add a internal
	class to represent parent rows (more needs to be stored here, like
	the selection state from the parent table, as well as the
	expansion state.)  Also, for datasources with relations, do the
	right thing for collapse/expand, and add support for the
	navigation/parent row buttons.

	Lastly, fix the crash in the 1.1.16 build.

	* GridTableStylesCollection.cs: make the explicit interface
	implementations call the class's methods as opposed to duplicating
	them.

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs: set the x/y offset of the textfield to
	0 so the text doesn't jump around when we move the cursor.

2006-07-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	* ListBox.cs: Match MS's ToString (this makes debugging focus
	stuff infinitely easier).

2006-07-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (SelectNextControl): When checking the control's
	parent use this instead of ctrl.parent so that null can be passed
	to SelectNextControl. (I have unit tests for this).
	- Remove unused var.

2006-07-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* CurrencyManager.cs: correct one regression, the removal of the
	finalType field.  Also, add a MonoTODO on CanAddRows, implement
	Refresh() correctly, and fix some event emission in
	ListChangedHandler.

2006-07-07  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Don't use brackets for new folders if they exist
	  under *nix. Instead use -(number of existing folders +1).

2006-07-07  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs:
	  - Fixed really nasty bug #78771
	  - Don't block the whole GUI when reading directories with a lot of
	    entries. Use an other thread instead and call BeginInvoke to
	    update the ListView in MWFFileView

2006-07-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (Dispose): release any Capture when disposing.

2006-07-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* LinkLabel.cs (Select): if we chain up to the parent, set
	focused_index to -1 so we'll search for the first available link
	the next time the user tabs into us.  Also, if the direction is
	backward and focused_index == -1, start the search from the last
	element.

2006-07-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* LinkLabel.cs (CreatePiecesFromText): if the link's range piece
	is beyond the end of the text, don't do anything.
	(CreateLinkPieces): set our ControlStyles.Selectable based on
	whether or not we have any links.
	(Link.Invalidate): use a loop instead of foreach.
	(Link.set_Start): null out owner.sorted_links so it'll be
	recreated by CreateLinkPieces.

2006-07-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* LinkLabel.cs: revert the SetStyle change.

2006-07-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* LinkLabel.cs (.ctor): SetStyle Selectable to true.
	(OnEnableChanged): s/Refresh/Invalidate
	(OnGotFocus): if we have a focused index already, refocus it (so
	if we mouse out/in to the window it'll focus the right link).
	(OnKeyDown): move the tab handling out of here.
	(OnLostFocus): don't set focused_index to -1, so we can refocus it
	when we lose focus.
	(OnMouseDown): don't Capture here - Control handles it.  Also,
	focus the active link.
	(OnMouseUp): don't deal with Capture.
	(OnPaintBackgroundInternal): remove.
	(OnTextAlignChanged): CreateLinkPieces before calling the
	superclass's method.
	(OnTextChanged): call CreateLinkPieces before calling superclass's
	method.
	(ProcessDialogKey): handle Tab here, and call Select(bool,bool) to
	move around.
	(Select): implement this, moving the selection between different
	links, and call parent.SelectNextControl if we don't have another
	link to focus in the given direction.
	(CreateLinkPieces): call Invalidate instead of Refresh.
	
2006-07-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: DrawLinkLabel changes to accomodate the
	new LinkLabel internals.

	* LinkLabel.cs: fairly major rewrite.  get rid of all the loops
	over pieces looking for active/focused/etc links.  also, deal with
	runs of text (and links) with embedded \n's in them, and use
	MeasureCharacterRanges instead of MeasureString to figure out the
	regions text occupies.  Lastly, do the usual s/Refresh/Invalidate
	two-step.

2006-07-04  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Enable key auto repeat. If the user doesn't have
	XKB or key auto repeat, do it manually.  Without key auto repeat,
	when a key is held down we get key press, key release, key press,
	key release, ... with auto repeat we get key press, key press, key
	press ..., and then a release when the key is actually released.

2006-07-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs:
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Tabs do not obey normal background color
	rules, they are always control color regardless of the background
	color.

2006-07-02  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Added internal class MWFConfig.
	  Removed Registry support and replaced it with support for the new
	  MWFConfig class. See MWFConfig comments for more information.

2006-06-30  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Added RadioButton and CheckBox focus
	  rectangle. Added some patches from eno from bug #78490 and fixed
	  the arrow position for small up and down CPDrawScrollButtons.

2006-06-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Remove some debug code.
	* Form.cs: When an MdiParent is set to null, the window is
	"detatched" and becomes a normal window.
	* MdiClient.cs: Don't bring the new child form to the front until
	it is activated (setting it as active does this), this makes the
	previously active forms titlebar get redrawn as inactive.

2006-06-29  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* PrintDialog.cs: Labels need a tab index too, otherwise they overlap
	  with later controls

2006-06-29  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: handle arrow keys in keynav state. Go active on down
	arrow in keynav state.  Fixes #78682.

2006-06-28  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* PrintDialog.cs: Reorder, relayout, remove extra code, set tab 
	  order (fixes #78393)

2006-06-28  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@ipobst.com>

	* AccessibleRole.cs, AccessibleStates.cs, AnchorStyles.cs, 
	  ArrangeDirection.cs, ArrangeStartingPosition.cs, ColorDepth.cs,
	  ControlStyles.cs, DataGridViewImageCellLayout.cs, DrawMode.cs,
	  FormBorderStyle.cs, FormStartPosition.cs, FormWindowState.cs,

	  ItemBoundsPortion.cs, Keys.cs, ListViewAlignment.cs,

	  Shortcut.cs, SizeGripStyle.cs, SortOrder.cs, StructFormat.cs,
	  TextFormatFlags.cs, ToolBarAppearance.cs, ToolBarButtonStyle.cs,
	  ToolBarTextAlign.cs, View.cs: 2.0 Changes to existing 1.x
	  enumerations (FlagsAttribute, SerializableAttribute, added/removed
	  values)

2006-06-28  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: implement scroll wheel support. Fixes #78360.

2006-06-28  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* PropertyGrid.cs,
	  PropertyGridTextBox.cs : explicitly set BackColor to differentiate
	  item lines from other area (It also makes BackColor consistent and
	  compatible with .NET). Fixed bug #78564.

2006-06-28  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* PropertyGrid.cs: refresh toolbar when PropertySort is set.
	Patch from Eno for #78555.

2006-06-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: s/grid.grid_drawing/grid

	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs: same.

	* DataGrid.cs: Roll DataGridDrawingLogic.cs into this file.
	
	* DataGridDrawingLogic.cs: nuke.

2006-06-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridTableStyle.cs: clean up the constructors, and build the
	list of child relations for this table.  I have no idea if this is
	where we should be doing it (it probably isn't), but since we're
	already iterating over the properties..

	* DataGrid.cs: add row resizing.  for now we add a DataGridRow
	struct and array for keeping track of row information, similar to
	what's shown in a hack on
	http://www.syncfusion.com/FAQ/WindowsForms/FAQ_c44c.aspx.

	* Theme.cs: be consistent about the naming of DataGrid methods,
	prefering ColumnWidths and RowHeights over columnsWidths and
	RowsHeights.

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: same, and also add support for variable
	sized rows (and the +/- expansion icons for related rows).

2006-06-27  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Applied Eno's patch from #78660

2006-06-27  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs (ScaleCore): We don't want to scale our form if it's
	  state is minimized or maximized, but we still need to scale our
	  child windows. Also, added try/finally block to ensure layout
	  gets reset (Fixes #78697)

2006-06-27  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Added 2.0 Scale(SizeF) method (Fixes 78700)

2006-06-27  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs: Fixed c+p error and added check to resize form if minimum
	  size is bigger than current size (Fixes #78709)

2006-06-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* ThemeEngine.cs (..ctor): Properly use ToLower() (Fixes #78704)

2006-06-26  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: only do Keypress handling in the combo when there  
	are items in the collection. Fixes #78710.

2006-06-26  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Binding.cs: make this work bi-directionally.  also, clear up
	other mixups between Push/Pull Data (e.g. we're supposed to pull
	data when validating).

	* BindingManagerBase.cs: trim some fully qualified collection
	types.

	* PropertyManager.cs (get_IsSuspended): oops, fix this check.

2006-06-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyManager.cs: It appears (according to the unit tests)
	that PropertyManager doesn't use
	PropertyDescriptor.AddValueChanged to track propery value changes
	in its datasource, but uses the same scheme as Binding, where it
	looks for a <Property>Changed event and binds to it.

	Also, according to the docs, IsSuspended always returns false for
	a property manager with a non-null datasource.

2006-06-22  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs: (ShowDialog): If we're returning a forced cancel we still
	  need to update the actual DialogResult. (Fixes #78613)

2006-06-22  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Form.cs (ShowDialog): Release any captures before running the
	  new message pump (fixes #78680)

2006-06-22  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: Layout column widths properly in details mode even 
	if HeaderStyle.None is set.  Fixes #78691.

2006-06-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Fixed taborder to match MS. Fixes #77873 partially.

2006-06-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs (ContainsFocus): Using new driver method to get focused
	  window, instead of trying to use internal tracking var, which can
	  recursion issues (Fixes #78685)
	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs, 
	  XplatUIWin32.cs: Added GetFocus method to return focused window

2006-06-21 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ColorDialog.cs: when the mouse button is pressed inside the color
	matrix, don't let the cursor move out of it until the button is
	released, which is the behavior on windows. Changed 'colours' by
	'colors' to use the same word consistently.

2006-06-21  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: add in some basic navigation stuff (navigating to a
	child relation and back, using a stack).  Also, remove
	GetDataSource and the code that calls it - it's not needed.  Also,
	track CurrencyManager.ListName's removal.

2006-06-21  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* CurrencyManager.cs: push some of the original type checking from
	BindingContext.CreateBindingManager to here, and remove some of
	the finalType stuff.  Need more tests to make sure I've got the
	ListName part right, and we might need more in SetDataSource.

	* PropertyManager.cs: add a ctor that takes just the datasource,
	and no property name.  Make SetDataSource work with a null
	property_name, and make Current return the data_source if the
	property descriptor is null.  this makes 'string foo = "hi";
	BindingContext[foo].Current' return "hi" as it should.

	* RelatedCurrencyManager.cs: make this code more generic - there's
	no reason the parent manager has to be CurrencyManager, and
	there's no reason to pass the DataRelation.  It suffices to use a
	BindingManagerBase and PropetyDescriptor.

	* RelatedPropertyManager.cs: make a similar change here.
	
	* BindingContext.cs: make CreateBindingManager the beautiful, tiny
	flower I knew it could be.

2006-06-20  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PropertyManager.cs: the PropertyChangedHandler is invoked when
	data in the source has changed and we need to update the control,
	so s/PullData/PushData.

	* CurrencyManager.cs: Refresh is meant to update the control from
	data in the datasource.  So, s/PullData/PushData.

	* BindingContext.cs: add more ugliness (we weren't handling the
	case where data_source = DataTable and data_member = column_name).

	* Binding.cs: fix PushData/PullData mixup.  Both are interpreted
	from the perspective of the datasource.  PullData pulls from the
	control, PushData pushes to the control.

2006-06-20  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* BindingContext.cs: rewrite the CreateBindingManager code to
	handle navigation paths more or less properly.  This could
	definitely stand some more work, in particular to push the
	recursion up to the toplevel.  But that relies on fixes in other
	places (System.Data comes to mind).

	Also, move to a flat hashtable (and encode the twolevel nature of
	the dictionary into the hash key).  This lets us implement the
	IEnumerable.GetEnumerator method.

	* RelatedCurrencyManager.cs: new class.  Update our view based on
	our relation and our parent CurrencyManager's position.

	* CurrencyManager.cs: split out some logic from the ctor into
	SetView, so it can be called from the new RelatedCurrencyManager
	subclass.

	* RelatedPropertyManager.cs: new class.  Update our datasource
	based on the position of our parent CurrencyManager.

	* PropertyManager.cs: split out some logic from the ctor into
	SetDataSource, so it can be called from the new RelatedDataSource
	subclass.  Also, make the Current getter return the value
	of the PropertyDescriptor, not the data_source.

	* Binding.cs: no need to duplicate the string splitting code here.

2006-06-19  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs:
	  - set_Enabled: OnEnabledChanged is not called if the inherited state 
	    of the control is not altered, even though  we might be changing the
	    internal state of the control (#78458)
	  - set_Enabled: (Re)Moved the enabling/disabling of the window to 
	    OnEnabledChanged, to allow easy altering of any child window state
	  - OnEnabledChanged: Added code to enable/disable driver window state
	  - OnParentEnabledChanged: Instead of firing the event, call 
	    OnEnabledChanged, which will fire the event and also a) set driver
	    window state and pass the enabled state to any grandchildren (#78458)

2006-06-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* InternalWindowManager.cs: We don't set the cursor explicitly
	thats done via the response to NCHITTESTs.
	- Don't need to adjust for titlebar heights anymore, the
	coordinates are coming in the correct coordinates now (see peters
	last patch).


2006-06-19  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs (GetMessage): WM_NCxBUTTONx messages were wrongly
	  being translated relative to whole window, instead of client window.
	  That caused broken offsets on mouseclick (and caused gas for our
	  InternalWindowManager)

2006-06-15  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextControl.cs:
	  - MoveCaret: Implemented PgUp, PgDown, CtrlPgUp and CtrlPgDown
	  - Undo(): Added replay of cursor move on DeleteChars action; added
	    calling Undo() again if a recorded cursor move is invalid (to
	    ensure that some action is performed on Undo)
	* TextBoxBase.cs (ProcessKey): Added handling of PgUp and PgDown (#78482)

2006-06-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Instead of just sizing maximized windows when
	there is a resize we also have to adjust the Y of minimized
	windows, so they stay pinned to the bottom of the mdi container.
	- Eliminate separate tracking of the active control, we can just
	get this from the controls collection.
	- Paint the decorations for the newly activated titlebar so we get
	a pretty blue bar.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs:
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Minimized windows get all three buttons
	even if they are a tool window.
	
2006-06-15  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextControl.cs (Undo): Handle non-existent cursor locations in the
	  undo buffer, these can happen when text was deleted and the cursor
	  was recorded first. Since we will also have a recorded cursor
	  after the delete this is not an issue. (Fixes #78651)

2006-06-14  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* AccessibleObject.cs: Remove dependence on Control.is_selected;
	  instead properly track control states internally (allows us to
	  remove is_selected from Control)

2006-06-14 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ImageListStreamer.cs: correctly generate the 1bpp mask for images
	whose width is not a multiple of 8.

2006-06-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs:  Only maximize the next child if the current one
	is maximized.

2006-06-13  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs: Invalidate the column when HeaderText is
	modified.  Also, guard against grid or grid_drawing being null in
	Invalidate.

	* DataGrid.cs: Reformat tons of getters/setters.  In the
	DataMember setter, just call SetNewDataSource instead of
	duplicating some of its functionality.  In SetNewDataSource, don't
	check ListManager for null, since the property getter creates the
	object if needed.

	* DataGridTableStyle.cs: don't set TableStyle or call
	SetDataGridInternal on the column here, it's done in
	GridColumnStylesCollection.Add.

	* GridColumnStylesCollection.cs: fix all the explicit interface
	implementations to just call our methods.  Nuke AddInternal() and
	move the body of it to Add().  Also, add a call to
	column.SetDataGridInternal to Add().

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs (.ctors): call this() instead of
	base()+duplicate code.  Also, use the Format property instead of
	format to generate an Invalidate ala MS.  Lastly, create the
	textbox here, unconditionally.
	(set_Format): call Invalidate.
	(get_TextBox): no need to call EnsureTextBox.
	(Commit): remove the message box.
	(Edit) remove the call to EnsureTextBox.
	(EndEdit): call HideEditBox instead of ReleaseHostedControl.
	(EnterNullValue): no need to check textbox for null.
	(HideEditBox): no need to check textbox for null.
	(SetDataGridInColumn): add the textbox to the grid's controls.
	(EnsureTextBox): nuke.
	
2006-06-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Hook up to the maximized menus paint event
	and redraw the buttons when needed. Unhook when the window is
	unmaximized.
	* MainMenu.cs: Add an internal Paint event, the mdi window manager
	needs this so that it can redraw its buttons when the menu is
	repainted.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs:
	* Form.cs: The method order has changed for DrawMaximizedButtons,
	so that it can be a PaintEventHandler.
	
2006-06-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: When we close a maximized mdi window, the next mdi
	window is activated and maximized, even if it wasn't before.
	- When  a new window is activated repaint the decorations of the
	old one, so that it no longer has the Active "look" (the blue
	titlebar).
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Open up CreateButtons to base classes
	so they can recreate the buttons on state changes.
	- If a window is maximized give it all three buttons
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Create the titlebar buttons when the state
	is changed, this is needed because a toolwindow will not have all
	three buttons until it is maximized.

2006-06-13  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* ProgressBar.cs : PerformStep() shouldn't exceed Maximum.
	  Fixed bug #78609.

2006-06-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* KeysConverter.cs: Make sure we handle the Ctrl special case
	if its the only key.
	
2006-06-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Theme.cs: Add a method to get the size of a managed window
	toolbar button.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Remove the ButtonSize property, this
	should be retrieved from the theme.
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Get the button size from the theme
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Make the method to get the managed window
	titlebar button size public.
	- Handle the different button sizes of maximized toolwindows
	(should match any maximized window).
	- Get the titlebar height from the theme, not the WM (which gets
	it from the theme).

2006-06-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Handle NC Double Clicks, passing the
	event down to the mdi window manager.
	- Expose some extra stuff to base classes
	- Make sure to end the Capture on an NC Mouse up, so that we can
	get double clicks properly, and the sizing doens't stick.
	- When doing PointToClient contain it in the workable desktop
	area, this prevents windows from changing size when the cursor is
	pulled outside of the working area while sizing.
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: When we get a double click maximize the
	window.
	- Reset the cursor after handling mode changes.

2006-06-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs (WorkingArea): Read the actual workarea for the 
	  current desktop, instead of just assuming a 0, 0 origin. This
	  is needed for our internal window manager, to know the top
	  margin of the desktop

2006-06-12  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs (set_CurrentCell): concede focus as we move around.
	we need this to get rid of the selected background in the bool
	column.
	(CancelEditing): move the ConcedeFocus call to above the Abort
	call.  Also, set is_changing to false and invalidate the row
	header if we were changing before.
	(ProcessKeyPreviewInternal): remove, since noone outside this
	class calls it anymore.  Roll the code into ProcessKeyPreview.
	(EndEdit): remove the internal version.
	(InvalidateCurrentRowHeader): make private.

	* DataGridBoolColumn.cs: simplify this class a bunch.  remove the
	Keys.Escape handling (and with it the last call to
	DataGrid.EndEdit from outside the class.)


2006-06-12  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridTextBox.cs (.ctor): isedit defaults to false.
	(OnKeyPress): set isedit to true.
	(ProcessKeyMessage): remove Keys.Enter handling from here.  it's
	already handled by the grid.

	* DataGrid.cs (set_CurrentCell): more work here.  it's still not
	right.  ugh.
	(set_DataSource): SetDataSource always returns true, so stop
	putting it in an if statement.
	(EndEdit): get rid of some {}'s
	(ProcessGridKey): return true in case Keys.Escape.
	(ProcessKeyPreviewInternal): only handle KEYDOWN messages.
	(ConnectListManagerEvents,DisconnectListManagerEvents): connect to
	PositionChanged, stopped connecting to CurrentChanged.
	(GetDataSource): simplify this a bunch.
	(SetDataSource): change return type from bool to void.
	(OnListManagerPositionChanged): rename OnListManagerCurrentChanged
	to this, and make sure we don't set ListManager.Position inside
	set_CurrentCell.
	(OnListManagerItemChanged): if we're passed an actual index,
	redraw that row.

	* CurrencyManager.cs (set_Position): don't call PullData here.

2006-06-09  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNode.cs:  Recalculate the visible order before doing the
	Expand/Collapse Below calls, because those calls generate an
	expose.
	- Reduce calls to the TreeView property, which is mildly expensive
	by using a local var.
	* Form.cs: Layout the MDI child windows when creating the parent
	form.
	- Don't use the internal constructor anymore
	* MdiClient.cs: use the parent form width/height (if available)
	when laying out the child windows, we do this because the
	mdiclient isn't docked yet when the initial layout is done.
	- Don't need an internal constructor anymore.

2006-06-08 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: handle access errors when trying to create a folder
	or changing to a directory. No need to initialize out parameters.

2006-06-08  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Append a number when creating a new folder if the
	  folder already exists (use parenthesis instead of square brackets)

2006-06-08  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs:
	  - Disabled registry support for windows and added better registry
	    error checking for other systems (need to investigate why it
	    works perfectly on my system)
	  - If a folder already exist show an error MessageBox instead of
	    trying to create an indexed name.
	  - Fixed a non intentional typo.

2006-06-08 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: (SetFileName) don't crash if CurrentRealFolder is null.

2006-06-08  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: When creating a new folder don't crash if the
	  folder already exists.

2006-06-08  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Allmost a complete rewrite.
	  - added a "virtual" file system that handles the differences
	    between unix and windows file systems (especially the directory
	    structure). Moved most of the directory and file handling code
	    into the vfs.
	    Added vfs classes: MWFVFS, FileSystem, WinFileSystem,
	    UnixFileSystem and FSEntry.
	  - Recently used folder/directory, size, location and used file names
	    (file name ComboBox) are now stored in the registry and get read
	    before the dialog shows up (fixes part 6 of bug #78446).
	  - Creation of new folders/directories is now possible (context menu
	    or ToolBar). Added TextEntryDialog for this that fills in the gap
	    until ListView.LabelEdit works.
	  - Fixed cursor handling (bug #78527) and focus handling for
	    PopupButtonPanel
	  - Various "Search in" ComboBox enhancements. The content of the
	    dropdown listbox now almost matches ms.
	  - Changed the behaviour when the user switches to SpecialFolder
	    Recent to show the ListView in View.Details.
	  - Beside using the ToolBar to change the View property of the
	    file ListView it is now possible to use the context menu too.

2006-06-08  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Don't create a new ObjectCollection when an item
	  gets inserted. Just insert the item in the existing object_items
	  ArrayList.

2006-06-08  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* OpenTreeNodeEnumerator.cs: Fix to use the Parent property, so
	that the treeview and root node checks are done also, this fixes a
	regression i caused in the unit tests.

2006-06-07  Wade Berrier <wberrier@novell.com> 

	* RichTextBox.cs: More ISO8859-1 -> unicode

2006-06-07  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs : use items to hold highlight/selection so that
	collection insertions don't require synchronization.

2006-06-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Simplify (and FIX) the window sizing
	routine.  We now always keep the sized edge at the cursor instead
	of computing movement and adjusting rects.  There is one buglet
	with this method though when the cursor is moved over area that
	the window can not expand too (such as the toolbars on the desktop).

2006-06-07 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: (IsEnabled,IsVisible) the window handler can be null
	here. Fixes crash on startup in AlbumSurfer.

2006-06-07  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* RichTextBox.cs: Replaced embedded ISO8859-1 chars with proper unicode
	  values

2006-06-07 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: call XPending and XNextEvent inside the same lock()
	statement to avoid calling XNextEvent which will block if another thread
	took the event that we were expecting. Fixes bug #78605.

2006-06-07  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs : isolated checkbox clicking from the selection logic.
	Toggle check state on item doubleclicks.  Really fixes #78454 part2.

2006-06-06  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* Form.cs: Check that the value passed to Form.DialogResult
	is a valid enum value.

2006-06-06 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: disable the up button when in 'Recently Used' or 'My
	Computer'. Clicking it in the network view goes to 'My Computer'.
	Added CIFS filesystem type. Display the mount point of filesystems.
	Avoid duplicate mount points (happens for me with CIFS);

2006-06-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Draw the maximized windows buttons
	when resizing.

2006-06-06 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: when running a modal dialog, ignore WM_CLOSE requests for
	all other dialogs. Fixes bug #78585.

2006-06-06  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* CheckedListBox.cs : apply CheckOnClick behavior to unchecking too.
	Only invalidate checkbox on checkstate changes to avoid flicker.
	* ListBox.cs : avoid unselect/select when clicking selected item.
	avoid reselection flicker for already multiselected items.
	Fixes #78382.

2006-06-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiWindowManager.cs: When the window is closed do an NCRecalc on
	the parent form so that the menu is removed if needed.

2006-06-06  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListBox.cs : add ScrollWindow call to UpdateTopItem.  fix
	Prev/Next/PrevPage/NextPage/Home/End index calculation.  Fixes #78559.

2006-06-06  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* CheckedListBox.cs : rebuild check collection on Add.  Fixes #78426.


2006-06-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Use the property (instead of the field) to get the
	default cursor so it is	instantiated correctly.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: The OS doesn't give us an NCPAINT with
	resizes so we need to manually repaint the window decorations here.
	- Set the titlebar button locations as soon as they are created,
	otherwise they are not set correctly on win32.
	
2006-06-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* CurrencyManager.cs (set_Position): call PullData before
	OnCurrentChanged.
	(AddNew): after calling IBindingList.AddNew, update our
	listposition, and call OnCurrentChanged/OnPositionChanged (without
	calling PullData).
	(OnCurrentChanged): remove the call to PullData from here.
	(OnItemChanged): remove the call to PushData from here.
	(OnPositionChanged): change the test from == null to != null to
	match the other methods.
	(ListChangedHandler): the grossest part of the patch.  Implement
	this such that it passes the unit tests in CurrencyManagerTest and
	the output more or less matches that of MS's implementation.
 
2006-06-06  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs : only update check state on single click.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs : fix focus drawing for details view without
	fullrowselect.  Fixes #78454.
	* XplatUIX11.cs : fix for double click emission.

2006-06-05  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs : Applied Atsushi's patch to fix
	font dialog bug  (#78197).

2006-06-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Compute the next node for expanding/collapsing
	correctly. We now factor in nodes without a NextNode
	correctly. (Fixes somes cases in nunit-gui).
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Set the bounds when updating the
	virtual position of a tool window.
	
2006-06-05  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: rename cached_currencymgr to list_manager.
	(set_CurrentCell): move SetCurrentCell code here, and clean it up
	some.
	(CurrentRow, CurrentColumn): single accessors so we can make the
	cursor movement code a lot easier to understand.
	(CurrentRowIndex): implement this in terms of CurrentRow.
	(BeginEdit): clean this up a bit.
	(CancelEditing): sort out the is_editing/is_changing/is_adding
	stuff a little.
	(EndEdit): minor changes.
	(OnKeyDown): add a comment about a (most likely) unnecessary
	check.
	(OnMouseDown): cancel editing when we click on a row header.  And
	use the CurrentRow setter, not CurrentCell.
	(ProcessDialogKey): directly call ProcessGridKey.
	(UpdateSelectionAfterCursorMove): factor out this common block of
	code (it's used everywhere that we move the cursor by updating row
	or column).
	(ProcessGridKey): pretty substantial overhaul.  Use the
	CurrentRow/CurrentColumn properties to make the code a lot more
	readable.  Only use the CurrentCell property when we have to
	modify both row and column at once.  Tab behavior is still broken,
	and Delete is untested.
	(Select): if we have no selected rows, set selection_start to
	@row.
	(EditCurrentCell): rename EditCell this.  It was only ever invoked
	with CurrentCell as the arg, so drop the arg and rename it.

	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs: clean up the constructors a little, and
	drop CommonConstructor().

	* DataGridTextBox.cs (.ctor): set accepts_return to true so we
	actually get notified when the user hits it.
	(ProcessKeyMessage): *substantially* simplify this method.
	There's no reason (that I can see) for the textbox to be making
	calls into the datagrid at all.  Remove all of them but the ones
	for Enter handling.  those will take some more work.

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs (ConcedeFocus): implement this by
	calling HideEditBox.
	(HideEditBox): if we have an active textbox, render it invisible
	without causing a re-layout of the datagrid.

2006-06-05  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs : fix NRE crasher when focuseditem is cleared by
	collection changes by resetting it to Items[0].  Fixes #78587.

2006-06-05 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* MessageBox.cs: if the height of the text is larger than the icon_size,
	use that. Fixes bug #78575.

2006-06-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Fix line drawing when scrolling.  To do this each
	node is basically responsible for drawing its entire horizontal
	area.  When drawing a node it draws its parent node lines if
	needed.
	- Adjust the clip area to the viewport rectangle
	- Fix Left/Right key handling to match MS. (It expand/collapses
	and moves to parents/first child but does not move selection to
	sibling nodes).
	- Fix SetTop to work with new bound calculation code
	- When scrollbars are no longer needed we need to reset scrolling
	vars and recalculate the visible order so the redraw is correct
	* TreeNode.cs: We can't expand/collapse nodes with no children.

2006-06-03  John Luke  <john.luke@gmail.com> 

	* X11DesktopColors.cs: dllimport the exact gtk and gdk versions
	so the colors work without dev packages
	
2006-06-02  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs 
	  - Select: Implemented to just use activate. Seems to match MS 
	    behaviour closest. Documented to only do actual control walking 
	    based on it's parameters if in a container control so I moved 
	    the code there.
	  - Removed selection check logic from our internal Select() method
	* ContainerControl.cs:
	  - Select: Moved selection logic from Control here, since MS documents
	    that containers obey the bool arguments. No longer calling base

2006-06-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: If the selected node isn't changed when we get
	focus update the previously selected node so that we see the
	selection box.

2006-06-02  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: restructure grab and general mouse event handling.
	Make the composite control raise mouse events like it was a single
	control for leaves/enters/motion/up/down events.  fix dropdown list
	coordinate mangling and refactor it into the scrollbar subclass to
	reduce code duplication.  Fixes #78282 #78361 and #78457.

2006-06-02  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs: remove Capture setting/clearing, as it happens
	automatically in the Control.WndProc.

2006-06-01 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: fix crash when running SharpChess, which sets the
	FilterIndex to 2 with only one Filter.

2006-06-01 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ToolBar.cs: add SizeSpecified property.
	* ToolBarButton.cs: when the ButtonSize is calculated by the container,
	try to figure out our real size, otherwise fallback to what the
	container says.

2006-06-01  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs (DefWndProc): WM_MOUSEWHEEL needs to be passed up
	* Control.cs (WndProc): MS always calls the DefWndProc to pass
	  up the event

2006-06-01  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: revamp the focus management in ListView.  It still
	causes churn of LostFocus/GotFocus emissions on clicks, but it's
	better than not handling focus at all.  Will revisit when pdb feels
	the general focus handling is solid.  Fixes #78526.

2006-06-01  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Set the default border style in the constructor.
	- Move painting to use OnPaintInternal instead of capturing
	WM_PAINT, this is the correct way of doing things
	- UpdateBelow shouldn't invalidate the scrollbar area
	- Cap the top on update below in case the node was above the top
	of the viewport rectangle.
	- ExpandBelow and Collapse below need to obey Begin/End Update.
	* TreeNode.cs: Make is_expanded internal so the treenode
	collection can change it without firing the whole event chain.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: When clearing all the child nodes make
	sure to recalc the visible order.
	- Improve algo for remove the top node

2006-06-01  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs (SetFocus): Make sure we can handle re-entrancy due to
	  SendMessage directly calling window procedures, which in turn might
	  call SetFocus()

2006-06-01  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Don't handle WM_SETFOCUS if the same window already
	  has focus (works around X11 sending a FocusIn after our SetFocus)
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Send KILLFOCUS before setting SETFOCUS on new window

2006-06-01  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* Mime.cs: Fix for the NET_2_0 build.
	  NameValueCollection needs StringComparer now.

2006-05-31  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridDrawingLogic.cs (FromPixelToColumn): modify this to also
	return (via an out parameter) the starting X of the column.
	(UpdateVisibleColumn): track change to FromPixelToColumn.
	(HitTest): add a ColumnResize case here.
	(DrawResizeLine): new function, probably poorly named.

	* DataGrid.cs (.ctor): get rid of cached_currencymgr_events.  We
	only need to keep one reference.
	(set_ListManager): same.
	(OnMouseDown): call HitTest instead of grid_drawing.HitTest.
	Also, add support for HitTestType.ColumnResize.
	(OnMouseMove): add column resize behavior here, and change the
	cursor to the correct one as we move around the datagrid.
	(OnMouseUp): terminate the column resize if we're resizing.
	(ProcessGridKey): from the MS docs, Alt-0 enters the null value
	for the current cell.
	(ConnectListManagerEvents): use cached_currencymgr.
	(DisconnectListManagerEvents): fill this in, using
	cached_currencymgr.
	(SetCurrentCell): remove cached_currencymgr_events handling.
	(SetDataMember): only call DisconnectListManagerEvents if
	cached_currencymgr is != null.
	(SetDataSource): same.
	(OnListManagerCurrentChanged): cached_currencymgr_events ->
	cached_currencymgr.

2006-05-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* BindingManagerBase.cs: Remove somedebug code that creeped into
	SVN.
	* TreeNode.cs: We get the indent level dynamically right now, so
	don't track it as a member.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Make sure all nodes added to the list
	have parents, treeviews/topnodes setup properly.
	- Don't attempt to track indent level.

2006-05-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* BindingContext.cs: Create the currency manager tables here.
	This allows us to more easily create null tables (when bad data
	members are used), and more easily create related currency
	managers.
	* CurrencyManager.cs: All the table creation stuff is done by the
	binding context now.
	- Current should throw an exception if listposition is -1.
	- CancelCurrentEdit/EndCurrentEdit, do nothing if the list hasn't
	been bound yet.

2006-05-30  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: allow reexpansion of zero-width column headers.
	Fixes #78528.

2006-05-28  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* CurrencyManager.cs (get_Current): after the late binding
	listposition = -1 fix, we need to guard against it here and return
	null, otherwise we raise an exception (which is swallowed
	elsewhere, and breaks datagrid databinding.)

2006-05-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs (ProcessMenuKey): We can legally get msg types other
	  than WM_SYSKEY, don't throw if get something unexpected (#78507)

2006-05-26  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ControlPaint.cs:
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: For color comparisons just use the ARGB
	values, it's faster and it's all we care about (we don't care if
	the names aren't equal).
	* KeyboardLayouts.cs: Eliminate some dead code.
	- Lazy init things
	* X11Keyboard.cs: Lazy init keyboard detection.
	- Cleanup access modifiers a little.

2006-05-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Once again, attempting to get layout just right.

2006-05-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* LinkLabel.cs (CreateLinkPieces): Use MeasureString to calculate
	  the sizes of each link section, that will result in sizes that
	  match DrawString's layout (Fixes #78391)

2006-05-27  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: If AddExtension property is true autocomplete the
	  extensions in SaveFileDialog correctly. Fixes bug #78453.
	  Set MyNetwork and MyComputer to "C:\" for windows. This should
	  fix part 8 of bug #78446 for now.

2006-05-26  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs (ColumnStartedEditing): fill these in.  for now just
	invalidate the current row header if we need to, but presumably
	we'll invalidate the row corrsponding to the bounds or
	editingControl.
	(GridHScrolled): switch back to this method, as it's part of the
	public api.  *sigh*.
	(GridVScrolled): same.
	(OnMouseWheel): hack up something that more or less works.  Call
	GridHScrolled/GridVScrolled directly, instead of duplicating much
	of their code here.
	(EnsureCellVisibility): reinstate a bunch of this code, since we
	can't just set the scrollbar Value and expect to do all the work
	in the ValueChanged handler.  Also, Call Update() after scrolling
	in one direction so the other XplatX11.ScrollWindow call has the
	proper stuff in the proper places.
	(EditCell): set is_editing to true before calling .Edit.

	* DataGridTextBox.cs (set_IsInEditOrNavigateMode): just set it,
	don't bother comparing first.
	(OnKeyPress): call grid.ColumnStartedEditing before calling
	base.OnKeyPress.  this will set is_changing and invalidate the row
	header if necessary.
	(ProcessKeyMessage): for WM_CHAR messages, call
	ProcessKeyEventArgs directly.  swallow anything other than WM_CHAR
	and WM_KEYDOWN.
	
	* DataGridBoolColumn.cs (Edit): don't set is_editing to true here.
	it's done in the DataGrid.
	(NextState): call grid.ColumnStartedEditing, which takes care of
	invalidating the row header (and setting is_changing).

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs (Edit): don't set is_editing to true
	here.  it's done in the DataGrid.

2006-05-25 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: allow changing the cursor when the mouse position is
	out of bounds but Capture is set.
	* LinkLabel.cs: handle the case when the mouse button is pressed on the
	linklabel but released somewhere else.

2006-05-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: When we get focus if there is no selected node make
	it the top node
	- Remove some uneeded setup code from Draw.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: If the tree doesn't have a top node when
	a new node is inserted make the new node the top.
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	* Timer.cs: Use Utc time so that no local time zone stuff needs to
	be used (should be faster).
	
2006-05-25  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs (EnsureCellVisibility): remove some code to fix a
	problem with the last commit.

2006-05-25  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs (ReleaseHostedControl): turns out we do
	need the invalidate call here, while scrolling right-to-left via
	the left arrow key (i.e. moving the editing cell while scrolling).

	* DataGrid.cs (.ctor): remove the initialization of
	ctrl_pressed/shift_pressed.  We no longer track them using key
	up/down handlers, but by using Control.ModifierKeys.  Also, switch
	to using ValueChanged handlers on the scrollbars instead of
	Scrolled event handlers.  This simplifies a bunch of the scrolling
	code.
	(GridHValueChanged): rename from GridHScrolled, and change it to
	work with the new event args.
	(GridVValueChanged): same.
	(OnMouseDown): initialize ctrl_pressed/shift_pressed here.
	(OnMouseWheel): actually scroll the datagrid.  Don't change the
	selected cell.
	(ProcessGridKey): correct all the keyboard navigation stuff I
	could find.  Ctrl up/down/left/right/home/end work now.
	(EnsureCellVisibility): correct method name spelling.  Also,
	simplify this a touch by not explicitly calling the
	ScrollToRow/ScrollToColumnInPixels methods.  We just set the
	scrollbar value.
	(OnKeyUpDG): no need for this method now.
	
2006-05-25 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* LinkLabel.cs: display the OverrideCursor when hovering the label.
	Fixes bug #78392.

2006-05-25  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: fix datagrid clipping problems caused by
	r61019.

2006-05-25  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Application.cs: Moved setting of is_modal and closing to before
	  we create the control, to allow the event handlers called as a
	  result of creation affect closing. Also removed Gonzalo's previous
	  change to setting DialogResult, the behaviour has been moved to 
	  Form.ShowDialog()
	* Form.cs: 
	  - ShowDialog(): Removed explicit creation of the form, let RunLoop
	    handle it instead
	  - ShowDialog(): If no dialog result is set, we need to return Cancel
	  - WM_CLOSE: Fire Closing/Closed events, and reset dialog result if
	    the close is cancelled

2006-05-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* StatusBar.cs: We only need to update the sizes of the other
	panels when we have auto size contents.  Also we are only updating
	the contents of the panel, not the borders, so compensate for the
	border width (TODO: get this width from the theme somehow).
	* TreeView.cs: Scrollable is true by default
	- Use invalidate instead of refresh where needed
	- Factor the scrollable value into scrollbar updating
	- Update the scrollbars if the Scrollable property is altered
	- Update the selected node if its ImageIndex is changed
	- Handle null nodes in UpdateNode (mainly so we don't have to
	check if selected is null when updating it
	- Fix VisibleCount to use the ViewportRectangle so that scrollbars
	are factored into the visible count
	- Use VisibleCount for clarity in the code
	- When the font is changed we need to recurse through all the
	nodes and invalidate their sizes
	
2006-05-25 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Application.cs: set the DialogResult to fixed when the main form is
	hidden or destroyed while being modal.

2006-05-25  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Theme.cs: Use Tangoified messagebox icons. 

	(GetSizedResourceImage): Also cope with width = 0 and do not
	trigger a warning in that case (0 means "give me your icon from
	the resouce, no special size needed).

2006-05-25  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Application.cs: Leave runloop if the the main modal form is 
	  hidden (fixes #78484)

2006-05-25  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* BindingContext.cs : reject null datasource in Contains() and
	  Item[].
	* CurrencyManager.cs : check data_member validity when data_source
	  is dataset. When it is late binding, the initial position is -1.

2006-05-24  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Dont't recalculate the visible order on
	inserted nodes that aren't visible.  This changes the
	max_visible_order which confuses scrollbar settings.
	- Use the enumerator to get the prev node instead of duplicating
	code.
	* TreeView.cs: Use new method for setting scrollbar values
	- Don't set the bounds every time the scrollbar is updated
	- When updating below the root node use an invalidate instead of a
	refresh to prevent the child controls (scrollbars) from being
	refreshed. (UpdateBelow still needs to be reworked anyways).
	- Reenable SetBottom now that visible orders are set correctly,
	added some debug code incase we ever get bad values there again.
	- Set the scrollbar max to 2 less then the max value, this
	compensates for the max value being one above the node count, and
	for scrollbars adding one extra "notch".
	- When drawing image nodes if there is an imagelist we draw the
	first image in the list if the supplied image index is out of the
	image list's bounds.
	
2006-05-24  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Don't blindly cache hwnd.ClientRect, reset it when 
	  we receive a size change from the WM (Fixes #78503)

2006-05-24  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs, XplatUIX11.cs: Refresh when setting the Clip 
	  rectangle (Fixes #78501)

2006-05-24  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* ButtonBase.cs: 
	  - Fixed MouseUp, MouseDown and MouseMove to treat mouseevent.Button 
	    as a bitfield.
	  - Fixed MouseMove to no longer switch pressed state unless the left
	    mouse button is pressed. Atsushi provided the original patch (#78485)
	  
2006-05-24  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs: New internal methods that allow us to change a
	couple values on the scrollbar (the most common case is maximum
	and large change) without getting multiple invalidates.

2006-05-24  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridBoolColumn.cs (Abort): revert back to the saved setting.
	(Edit): save off the original state in oldState, and set
	grid.is_editing to true.
	(OnKeyDown): abort editing if escape is pressed.  also, call
	NextState if space is pressed.
	(OnMouseDown): call NextState.
	(NextState): factor out shared code from OnKeyDown and OnMouseDown
	here.  Also, only invalidate the row header once (on the initial
	is_changing switch) to save on redraws.

2006-05-24  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs (Commit): only call SetColumnValueAtRow
	if the value in the cell is different than it was before.  This
	keeps us from triggering a layout when we move around a datarid
	with a highlighted cell.
	(Edit): suspend layout when creating/positining the text box, and
	resume passing false so we don't ever actually re-layout.
	(ReleaseHostedControl): same.
	(EnsureTextBox): reformat slightly, and set WordWrap to false.

	* DataGridTextBox.cs (ProcessKeyMessage): it's not true that all
	control-key sequences should go to the datagrid - remove that
	lock.  Also, modify the conditions under which we move between
	cells when moving the cursor within a cell, and remove the "this"
	and "base" from field accesses.  We weren't even consistent, given
	they all were in the base class.

2006-05-24  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Binding.cs : (.ctor)
	  An obvious NRE fix for BindingTest.CtorNullTest().

2006-05-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs (get_Text): don't add a trailing newline, add
	them between lines.  This fixes some quirks editing cells in the
	datagrid.

2006-05-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Use begin/end update when doing expand/collapse all
	so that we don't get flicker on the scrollbar.

2006-05-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Bounds are computed 'on the fly' now.  This allows
	treenode calculations to be independant of the painting code. To
	do this nodes track a visible order which is calculated by the
	treeview.
	- Call new methods for expanding/collapsing nodes.  These methods
	use scrollwindow so we don't have to update everything below the
	node.
	* TreeView.cs: Refactored drawing and scrolling code.  We don't
	need to update nodes when drawing anymore or calculate scrollbar
	stuff.
	- Added new methods for expanding/collapsing nodes. These methods
	use ScrollWindow so as to not have to redraw all the nodes below.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Recalc visible order and scrollbars when
	we add/remove nodes or sort.
	- Handle removing the selected and the top node properly.

2006-05-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs (Edit): set grid.is_editing to true.
	maybe this should actually happen in the datagrid code?
	(EndEdit): no need to invalidate anything, given that
	ReleaseHostedControl causes the datagrid to relayout, which
	invalidates everything anyway.

	* DataGrid.cs (set_CurrentCell): remove duplicate check (it's also
	in SetCurrentCell).
	(set_SelectionBackColor): call InvalidateSelection instead of
	Refresh.
	(set_SelectionForeColor): same.
	(BeginEdit): Flesh this out a bit.
	(CancelEditing): only do any of this if we're editing/adding.
	(EndEdit): same.
	(OnMouseDown): there's no need to cancel editing here, it's done
	in SetCurrentCell.
	(SetCurrentCell): only invalidate the current row header if it's a
	different row than the new one.
	(ShiftSelection): fix this to work like MS does.
	(ResetSelection): factor out the invalidation of selected_rows to
	InvalidateSelection.
	(SetDataSource): cancel any editing that's going on.

	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs
	(IDataGridColumnStyleEditingNotificationService.ColumnStartedEditing):
	call the non-interface version.

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs (DataGridPaintColumsHdrs): intersect the
	header rectangle with the clip rectangle so we don't redraw the
	entire header for just a small area.  Gets rid of the last flicker
	when horizontally scrolling.
	(DataGridPaintRow): same.

2006-05-23  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: remove size for line hack from LargeIcon layout.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: don't draw line.  it's really the top of a
	poorly placed checkbox on the MS control.  Fixes Alex's unfiled
	Critical bug report.

2006-05-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* PictureBox.cs: Fixed broken ControlStyles. Unit test no longer fails,
	  and this fixes #78493

2006-05-23  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Theme.cs (GetSizedResourceImage): Scale images if the proper
	size is not found.  
	
	* FileDialog.cs: Do not change the background for the side bar as
	it wont work nicely with the theme, and also reduces the artifacts
	in rendering the icons (which I want to fix too).

	* MimeIcon.cs (ResourceImageLoader): Load images from assembly
	resources, not resgen resources. 

	(PlatformDefaultHandler): Pull images using the new API.

2006-05-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Hwnd.cs (Dispose): Remove any pending exposures. XEventQueue holds
	  a reference to the hwnd and will not remove it unless there are
	  no pending exposures (fixes #78341)
	* XplatUI.cs: Improved debug

2006-05-23  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs : don't handle OnClick event when it was not the left
	  button. Fixed bug #78487.

2006-05-23  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: fix placement of submenus for multi-row menu bars, and
	prefer submenus to the top menu for item lookup, to avoid popping down
	top-row items.

2006-05-23  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Rewrote CPCPDrawScrollButton to drop
	  Graphics.FillRectangle as the visual results are really bad (even
	  on win). We now draw perfect arrows (and perfect shadows when the
	  scrollbar is disabled). Simplified CPDrawGrid. CPDrawGrid now uses
	  Pen.DashPattern to draw the dots of each line.

2006-05-22  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Update the filename combobox when navigating through
	  the ListView with the cursor keys. Fixes part 7 of bug #78446.

2006-05-22  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: raise SelectedIndexChanged on keyboard selection.
	Fixes #78463.

2006-05-22  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Refresh in EndUpdate to pick up all the dropped Paint
	requests. Fix a misspelled parameter and a copy paste exception error
	in Select.

2006-05-22  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Changed DefaultFont emSize from 8.25 to 8
	  to get the same width/height (5/13) on X11 as the default font has on
	  win32. This means that our DefaultFont emSize is smaller than the 
	  the MS SWF equivalent (even thought the width/height stays the same)

2006-05-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs:
	* MdiWindowManager.cs:
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Make sure to use the border width from
	the theme.

2006-05-20  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* PrintDialog.cs: Implements printer details

2006-05-19  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Added focus handling for PopupButtonPanel.
	  Fixes part 1 and 2 of bug #78446

2006-05-19  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs (SetWindowPos): Recalculate client area size on resizes
	  instead of sticking to the first ever calculated value

2006-05-19  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: fix mouse motion selection to use MousePosition and
	PointToClient, since Capture is set. Fixes #78344.

2006-05-19  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: match MS behavior in Details view where items are not
	drawn if Columns.Count == 0. 
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: only highlight ListView selection if focused.
	Use a separate pen to draw the check, since changing the width affects
	the box as well.  Fixes #78454.

2006-05-18  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: ArgumentOutOfRangeException, single versions of the
	exception should throw the name of the invalid argument.

	* FileDialog.cs (OnClickOpenSaveButton): Avoid crash in open if
	there are no files listed. 

2006-05-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Don't use endcaps, they mess the drawing
	up.

2006-05-18  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: Brought back our old UpdateZOrder method as a private
	  function and switched our calls from UpdateZOrder to the new one.
	  This fixes the Paint.Net canvas disappearing bug.

2006-05-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Theme.cs:
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Move the drawing into the theme,
	expose everything the theme should need from the window manager.

2006-05-18  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (DefWndProc): WM_SETCURSOR: Assign the return value 
	  from the call to NativeWindow to avoid walking up the parent chain
	  further than needed (speeds up setting cursors and avoids setting
	  the wrong cursor if a parent has another cursor defined)
	* Cursor.cs: When loading an icon as cursor, MS uses the center of
	  the icon as hotspot, not what's contained as hotspot in the icon
	  file. This fixes the perceived drawing offset seen with Paint.Net
	
2006-05-18  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: 
	  - Store the calculated rectangle in Hwnd object and use it when 
	    setting the client size
	  - Force Toolwindows to always be type Dock, to ensure they're on top

2006-05-18  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: first pass at ComboBox rework.  Layout is more
	consistent with MS positioning.  IntegralHeight, ItemHeight, Sizing.
	Correctly initialize textcontrol and ListBox on DropDownStyle changes. 
	Substantial refactoring to remove confusing nested classes. Coding
	standard and Get+Set->property refactorings.  Shift to index based
	highlighting in ComboListBox instead of constantly using IndexOf and
	Items[]. Add invalidations on resize for DropDownList to fix ugliness
	in FileDialog growth.  Draw borders manually since Simple mode needs
	to look like two independent controls.  Make listbox border
	conditional to DropDownStyle.  Improved OwnerDraw support.

2006-05-18  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* PaintEventArgs.cs: For 2.0, check for a null Graphics in the .ctor. 
	Don't set the disposed graphics to null, so we can throw the "right"
	exception if the graphics is reused later (added a flag to avoid 
	double disposing). Some behaviours are different under 2.0 and are
	filled under bug #78448.

2006-05-18  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: When double-buffering is enabled, we need to reset
	  our graphics context between paint calls. Otherwise, any 
	  transformations and other alterations on the context will 
	  become cumulative (#77734)

2006-05-18  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: do focused item selection like MS on clicks. 
	Rework focus handling for ItemControl so LostFocus invalidates as
	well.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: only draw focus rectangle for ListViewItems if
	the ListView ItemControl has focus.

2006-05-17  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: If client_window ends up being width or height zero
	  due to border settings, move it off window inside whole_window (#78433)

2006-05-17  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* Mime.cs: Shrink the mime file cache correctly.

2006-05-17  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Readded button focus drawing code. (#78429)

2006-05-16  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (AddExpose): More sanity checks

2006-05-16  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - AddExpose: Don't add expose ranges outside the size of our
	    window
	  - Cast opacity values to Int32 to avoid crashes with certain
	    values
	  - Added disabled code paths that protect against illegal cross-
	    thread painting (Developers.exe)

2006-05-16  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ProgressBar.cs: Invalidate the control when it's resized
	  since block size is based on control size. (#78388)

2006-05-16  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* DataGrid.cs (SetDataBinding): per the discussion on irc, instead
	of setting the incoming argument to the "reset" value, we set the
	this.datamember to string.empty (before we were invalidating the
	incoming data).   

	Fixes 78420

2006-05-16  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs: Only apply transparency settings after the form
	  is created. (Fixes #77800)

2006-05-16  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ApplicationContext.cs: Grab the HandleDestroyed event so
	  we know when to fire OnMainFormClosed 

2006-05-16  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Application.cs: Introduced sub-class to allow tracking of
	  threads and centralized triggering of the event mess for
	  ThreadExit, AppExit, etc..  (#76156)

2006-05-16  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs:
	  - Do not return a null icon index value for a mime subclass.
	    Instead try the main mime type class too.
	  - Seems that some newer distributions don't have a link to some
	    gnome default icons anymore. So check the default gnome dir too.
	  

2006-05-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Don't paint the parent background image if we have
	our own background image.

2006-05-16  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs:
	  - PerformLayout: Do not shrink space filled by DockStyle.Fill
	    controls, all filled controls are supposed to overlap (#78080)
	  - UpdateZOrder is supposed to update the control's z-order in the
	    parent's z-order chain. Fixed to behave like that
	  - BringToFront: Removed obsolete code
	  - SendToBack: Simplyfied
	  - SetChildIndex: Trigger layout calculations when Z-order changes
	    since layout is done by z-order

2006-05-16  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	[ fixes bug #78410 ]
	* DataGrid.cs (set_AlternatingBackColor): use
	grid_drawing.InvalidateCells instead of Refresh().
	(set_BackColor): call grid_drawing.InvalidateCells.
	(set_BackgroundColor): use Invalidate instead of Refresh.

	* DataGridDrawingLogic.cs (InvalidateCells): new function, just
	invalidate the cell area.

2006-05-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	[ fixes bug #78011 ]
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs (DataGridPaintRows): pass the clip argument
	on to DataGridPaintRow.
	(DataGridPaintRow): take a clip argument, and only draw the cells
	which intersect it.  same with the not_usedarea.

	* Theme.cs (DataGridPaintRow) add @clip parameter.

	* DataGrid.cs (ScrollToColumnInPixels): simplify, use
	XplatUI.ScrollWindow.
	(ScrollToRow): same.

	* DataGridDrawingLogic.cs (UpdateVisibleColumn): fix corner case
	with last column which was causing a gray swath to appear with the
	XplatUI.ScrollWindow code.

2006-05-15  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ListBox.cs (HorizontalScrollEvent): in the non-multicolumn case,
	use XplatUI.ScrollWindow.
	(VerticalScrollEvent): use XplatUI.ScrollWindow.

2006-05-15  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Added handling of middle-button paste for X11. (#78375)

2006-05-15  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Cursors.cs: For X11, read NWSE and NESW cursors from our resource
	  file since there are no equivalent X11 cursors

2006-05-15  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* MonthCalendar.cs : DateTimePicker should reflect selected date
	  on mouse*up*, not mouse*down*. Fixed originally reported part of
	  bug #76474.

2006-05-15  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs : When argument index is equal or more than tab
	  count, just ignore. Fixed bug #78395.

2006-05-15  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Dispose all child controls when control is diposed (#78394)

2006-05-14  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ColorDialog.cs: Finally it is possible to select the color with
	  the text boxes

2006-05-14  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* PrintDialog.cs: Fix typo

2006-05-14  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* PrintDialog.cs: PrintDialog is not resizable
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Draw non links in LinkLabel with the correct
	  color. Made some ToolBar drawing methods protected virtual.

2006-05-13  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* PrintDialog.cs: Implementation of the PrintDialog

2006-05-12  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs (set_Value): don't use Dirty/Invalidate to move the
	thumb, instead use MoveThumb.  This has the side effect of making
	most of the other thumb moving machinery use MoveThumb as well.
	(OnHandleCreated): pass false for @dirty to UpdateThumbPos, as we
	need to actually invalidate the rectangle where the new thumb will
	go.
	(MoveThumb): use XplatUI.ScrollWindow to move the thumb around.
	We force an Update() after, so it's not as fast as it could be,
	but at least there's zero flicker and no droppings.
	(OnMouseMoveSB): in the thumb dragging case, use MoveThumb.
	(UpdateThumbPos): add another argument (dirty), which says whether
	or not to calculate/add dirty regions which we later invalidate.
	For cases where we know we're going to use MoveThumb, we pass
	false for this.  Otherwise, pass true.

2006-05-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Class.cs: Fixes for alignment and icon rendering in
	the status bar.
	
2006-05-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs: Added new SetClipRegion
	  and GetClipRegion methods and UserClipWontExposeParent property.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Implemented SetClipRegion/GetClipRegion methods,
	  overriding UserClipWontExposeParent property, setting to false, since
	  Win32 handles the required expose messages to draw our clipped parent
	  areas internally
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Implemented SetClipRegion and GetClipRegion; updated
	  PaintEventStart to set the user clip region if set.
	* Control.cs: 
	  - Now internally tracking the Region for the control since we need to
	    store it if the handle is not yet created and only set it when it
	    becomes created. Before setting the region forced handle creation
	  - Added code to draw the parents underneath a user-clipped region
	* Hwnd.cs: Added UserClip property

2006-05-12  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs (set_LargeChange): Refresh() -> InvalidateDirty()
	(set_Maximum): same.
	(set_Minimum): same.
	(set_SmallChange): same.
	(OnMouseUpSB): remove the call to refresh when releasing the
	thumb.  We shouldn't need it.
	
2006-05-12  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* StatusBar.cs (UpdatePanel): If the panel being refreshes has the
	AutoSize set to None, we do not need to relayout everything, we
	just need to invalidate the current region.

	(Draw): Do not draw the entire ClientArea, just redraw the
	clip area being passed.

	* MdiClient.cs: Make MdiClient constructor with the Form argument
	internal. 

2006-05-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs (DrawToolBar): Flat toolbars get their
	parents background image,  but strangely not their own.
	- (DrawStatusBarPanel): Take into account horizontal alignment
	when drawing the strings and icons.

2006-05-12  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListBox.cs: avoid invalidations for focus when the collection is
	empty. 

2006-05-12  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs (OnMouseMoveSB): when dragging the thumb, don't
	invalidate the entire thumb area.  Call InvalidateDirty which
	limits the redraw to the thumb itself and surrounding pixels.

	* XplatUIX11.cs (ScrollWindow): optimize copying.
	
2006-05-12  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DataGridDrawingLogic.cs: make CalcGridAreas non-reentrant.
	Figure out the positioning/layout in a single pass instead of
	multiple recursive invocations.  Speeds up the initial display of
	the data grid.  Also, make many things private that were
	originally public but unused outside this class.

2006-05-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Improved layout code.

2006-05-11  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* PropertyGrid.cs : Only check GetPropertiesSupported for properties,
	  not SelectedObject.

2006-05-11  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Hwnd.cs (Invalid): don't start off with Rectangle.Empty, as
	union of that will always be {0,0,width,height}.

2006-05-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: Match MS's DefaultSize for forms (they must have
	changed the size in sp2).

2006-05-11  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs : implement CTRL+A (select all). Fixed bug #78368.

2006-05-11  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* TextControl.cs : Fixed bug #78109. This incorrect position
	  comparison caused crash on automatic line split.
	* TextBoxBase.cs : reduce duplicate code.

2006-05-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Active form is only sent to the back when using
	the Next form functionality, when a form is clicked the current
	active shouldn't be sent to the back.
	- Layout the mdi windows when the container is first made visible.
	* Form.cs: Give the MdiClient a ref to the containing form when we
	create it.
	
2006-05-10  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* LinkLabel.cs : link_font could be uninitialized, so populate one
	  before actual use. Fixed bug #78340.

2006-05-10  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs : clipboard format native value is IntPtr.
	  Fixed bug #78283.

2006-05-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: 
	  - Instead of showing context menus directly we send WM_CONTEXTMENU, 
	    which is passed up the parent chain by DefWndProc
	  - We now handle WM_CONTEXTMENU to display any menu, or pass it 
	    to DefWndProc (#77956)
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Added handling of WM_CONTEXTMENU (pass up) to DefWndProc

2006-05-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: We need to remove the controls from the mdi
	collection, when we close the window.
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Special handling of closing mdi windows.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Make the close method virtual so the
	mdi window manager can handle it specially.

2006-05-10  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs:
	  - Recalculate grid when the data source has changed
	  - Matches styles provided by user from all data sources types
	* DataGridTableStyle.cs: For columns that provided by the user set the
	with the preferred value is there was unassigned.
	* CurrencyManager.cs: throw OnItemChanged event

2006-05-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* PictureBox.cs: Don't animate until handle is created. Start animation
	  when handle is created.

2006-05-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs, Hwnd.cs: Adopted Mike's patch from #77979 to match
	  current codebase.
	* XEventQueue.cs: We don't need to provide the extra info

2006-05-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: If the mdi clients parent form has a background
	image set, we draw that background image for the mdi area's
	background.

2006-05-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Set IBeam cursor (#78347)

2006-05-10  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ToolBar.cs: fix some text padding issues with ButtonSize
	calculation. Update the default size to match MS documentation.
	* ToolBarButton.cs: use ToolBar.ButtonSize for layout of unspecified
	button size. Fixes #78296.

2006-05-10  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListBox.cs: use is_visible for scrollbar positioning in case the
	control isn't on screen yet.  Fix off by one with Right vs Width
	usage.  Update Scrollbars in SetBoundsCore. Fixes #78188 and #78258.
	
2006-05-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Drop to a control with another control on top of it.
	* ToolBar.cs: Work on a copy of the buttons list, so that it can
	be modified in click handlers. TODO: Look for similar problems in
	other controls.

2006-05-09  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: Window managers need the old window state when setting
	window state now.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Allow the base mdi window manager to
	handle more of the MDI only stuff (like maximize buttons).
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Fix some snafus in changing the window
	state.  Add all the menu functionality, for both popup and
	maximized menus.
	* MdiClient.cs: When a new form is selected the currently
	activated form is sent to the back, this matches MS.
	- Implement a new method to activate the next mdi child window.

2006-05-08  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: 
	  - Added new InternalCapture method to allow controls to prevent
	    the capture behaviour on the click handlers
	  - Switched to use InternalCapture
	* ComboBox.cs:
	  - Using InternalCapture to prevent mouse captures from being released
	    on mouse button release (Fixes #78100)
	* XplatUIX11.cs (DeriveStyles): Now checks caption state and only
	  returns Form borders if a caption is present. (Fixes #78310)

2006-05-08  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TreeNode.cs: Changed serialization .ctor to not require every field
	  to be present. (#78265)
	* OwnerDrawPropertyBag.cs: Added serialization .ctor

2006-05-05  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: for is faster than foreach for strings.

2006-05-05  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* CheckedListBox.cs: update check handling code to not use selected.
	* ListBox.cs: rewrite of mouse selection handling to correspond to MS
	behavior for visual feedback, motion response, shift/ctrl handling,
	and properly deal with all 4 selection modes. Updates to bounds
	handling logic.  Add scroll wheel support. [Fixes #77842]

2006-05-05  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* ListView.cs:
	  - Moved adding of Implicit controls into .ctor. That way, subsequent
	    creation of the controls will not cause them to think they are 
	    toplevel windows (fixes #78200 header problem)
	  - Added 2.0 ShowGroups and UseCompatibleStateImageBehaviour
	  - Switched visibility setting of header control to use internal field
	    to avoid triggering handle creation
	  - Now checking if handle is created before causing a refresh when items
	    are added (This makes us now match handle creation time with MS)
	* Splitter.cs: Removed loading of private splitter cursor, switched to
	  Cursors version now that that is loading the right ones
	* Cursors.cs: Load proper splitter cursors from resources
	* Cursor.cs: Added second method of loading resource cursors for the 
	  VS.Net users amongst us

2006-05-05  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: give header_control a minimum size based on the
	ListView size.

2006-05-05  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: WS_EX_TOPMOST requires window to be on top. A dock
	  window seems to do that with metacity, so set that type. (#78120)

2006-05-05  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs: fix Details mode checkbox layout bug.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: draw a ListView column header for unused space
	at the end of the header, if it exists. [Fixes for #78200]

2006-05-04  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Add a helper property to get the container form.
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: We have to make sure to use the menu origin
	when drawing the icons and buttons, this fixes maximized window
	icons/buttons on win32.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Reset the restore captions when a
	window goes from Maximized to Minimized and vice versa. Move the
	DrawMaximizedButtons into the MdiWindowManager source, tool
	windows can't be maximized. NOTE: This could use a little
	refactoring if time ever permits.
	
2006-05-03  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* TextBox.cs: Add MWFCategoryAttributes
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Add MWFCategoryAttributes
	* Form.cs: Add MWFCategoryAttributes

2006-05-03  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* Control.cs: Add MWFCategoryAttributes
	* ScrollableControl.cs: Add MWFCategoryAttributes

2006-05-03  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Draw the ToolBar top border only if
	  Divider is true. Fix a little glitch in PropertyToolBar
	  drawing code

2006-05-02  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs:
	  - Dispose: Call base.Dispose, this causes the disposed event
	    to be fired (and probably other, more important stuff)
	  - SetVisibleCore: Set is_visible to true after creating the
	    window so that the window still gets created invisible (if
	    WM_VISIBLE isn't set). That will cause the ShowWindow afterwards
	    to generate a WM_ACTIVE message
	* Form.cs: Call Dispose when we want to destroy the window, instead of
	  just destroying the handle (Dispose will do that for us)
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - RootWindow also needs a queue, so we can properly process the
	    property change events from RootWindow (like Activate)
	  - Generatic synthetic WM_ACTIVE message when the active window is
	    being destroyed

2006-05-01  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* LinkLabel.cs: Trigger a recalc of our label dimensions when
	  bounds are changed

2006-05-01  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs (ButtonBase_DrawImage): Use the proper image
	  for determining width and height (image might not be assigned if
	  we're drawing an imagelist)

2006-05-01  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs: Added MenuHeight property
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Overriding new MenuHeight property, retrieving
	  height from system
	* Theme.cs: No longer returns hardcoded menu height, instead calls
	  new driver method
	* Form.cs (OnLoad): Scaling happens before triggering Load events 
	  on MS (# 78257)

2006-05-01  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MenuItem.cs: fix NRE for text == null.  Fixes #78250.

2006-04-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Removed Fixme
	* RichTextBox.cs (set_RTF): Invalidate document after update (#78247)

2006-04-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - ScrollWindow: We were passing hwnd.ClientRectangle which returns
	    the rectangle relative to the parent, considering borders. We
	    don't really want that.
	  - ScrollWindow: Fixed warning to be more understandable
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Fixed ScrollWindow calculations to consider our
	  scrollbars and scroll only the visible area
	* RichTextBox.cs: Removed debug output

2006-04-29  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* NumericUpDown.cs (Text): Just use base
	* UpDownBase.cs: Ensure txtView is created before using it

2006-04-29  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs (SetWindowTransparency): Casting opacity to int before
	  casting to IntPtr to avoid 64bit overflow errors

2006-04-29  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs:
	  - AllowDrop: Don't force handle creation.
	  - CreateHandle: Added call to tell driver if we're allowed to drop

2006-04-27  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Remember the last directory not only for the
	  current instance but also for new FileDialog instances.

2006-04-29  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 
	
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Forgot to set the queue on the foster parent. That
	  broke sending async messages

2006-04-29  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - ScrollWindow: Fixed method. We finally generate expose events again
	    for scrolled areas. This was causing 'garbage' when scrolling
	    textbox and other controls that used ScrollWindow
	  - Switched from using the regular queue for paint events to the MS 
	    model of 'generating' paint events when the queue is empty.
	    We use the new XQueueEvent.Paint subclass to store which windows
	    need painting.
	  - AddExpose now takes the x/y/width/height of the exposed area
	    and inserts the window into the paint queue if not already there
	  - InvalidateWholeWindow: Switched to use new AddExpose method
	  - UpdateMessageQueue: Added which queue to monitor for paint events
	  - DefWndProc: Added default handler for WM_PAINT and WM_NCPAINT in
	    the unlikely case nothing above handles it. We reset the expose
	    pending states to get them off the queue.
	  - GetMessage: Now pulls a paint event if no other events are in the
	    queue
	  - Invalidate: Switched to new AddExpose method
	  - PeekMessage: Updated to understand pending paint events
	  - UpdateWindow: Fixed logic bug. We were only updating if the window
	    didn't need updating. Also switched to sending WM_PAINT directly,
	    like MS does.
	* XEventQueue.cs: Added Paint queue support. Allows enqueue/dequeue
	  and random access Remove(). The random access is needed to handle
	  UpdateWindow() where a WM_PAINT is sent directly without accessing
	  the queue.
	* ScrollBar.cs: Added Update() calls to cause immediate updates to
	  allow for better feedback when scrolling. Scrollbars are small and
	  the immediate update should make it 'feel' more responsive without
	  slowing things down. ScrollBar still needs it's invaliate logic
	  updated to not always invalidate the whole bar on certain changes.

2006-04-28 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs:
	(BackColor): if the control does not support a transparent background,
	return the default backcolor when the parent backcolor is transparent.

2006-04-28  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Application.cs: Updated to new StartLoop/GetMessage API
	* RichTextBox.cs: Provide some output on RTF parsing errors
	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs: Added
	  new queue_id argument to GetMessage and PeekMessage to allow faster
	  handling of per-thread queues in drivers.
	* Hwnd.cs: Added Queue tracking and property
	* MenuAPI.cs: Updated to new StartLoop/GetMessage API
	* XEventQueue.cs: Added thread trackingA
	* PropertyGridView.cs: Updated to new StartLoop/GetMessage API
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Implemented new per-thread queue
	  - GetMessage: Fixed return/break behaviour on several cases. We were
	    returning stale messages in some cases, instead of just processing
	    the next message

2006-04-27  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* PropertyGrid.cs: Call GetPropertiesSupported on TypeConverter.

2006-04-27  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs (DrawToolBar): Refactored, simplified the logic,
	  fixed off-by-one comparisons between Width/Height and Right/Bottom.

2006-04-27  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* PropertyGridView.cs: Fix drop down width.

2006-04-27  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Peter thinks that three additional lines are
	  a mess in DrawToolBar, so I removed one of them.

2006-04-27  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Draw the ToolBar border lines only if
	  needed (clip). Otherwise we get artifacts.

2006-04-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* FixedSizeTextBox.cs: Added constructor to allow specifying which
	  dimension is fixed
	* UpDownBase.cs: Set the spinner control to be fixed height vertical,
	  and switched FixedSizeTextBox to only be fixed vertical (#78116)
	* Form.cs: Not applying the 'MS 0.08 fudge factor' for a given dimension
	  if it matches the scale base font (avoids unneeded scaling)

2006-04-26  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* X11DesktopColors.cs: One gtk_init_check should be enough

2006-04-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Moved Backspace handling into WM_CHAR block to
	  match MS behaviour

2006-04-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: 
	  - Generate OnTextChanged for Backspace even if we're only deleting
	    the current selection
	  - When setting the Text property, only select all text if the
	    control does not have focus when it is being set. Otherwise
	    just place the cursor at the beginning of the control

2006-04-26  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: ToolBars get drawn with two lines at the top.
	  Added a little helper to draw PropertyGrid ToolBar with a different
	  border and a different BackColor.
	* PropertyGrid.cs: Some background parts didn't get painted with the
	  correct background color. Added a class that helps us to draw the
	  correct border for PropertyGridView and a class that helps us to
	  draw ToolBars with a different backcolor
	* PropertyGridView.cs: Draw PlusMinus with the correct colors.

2006-04-25  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* PropertyGrid.cs: Bug 78196, font size, and splitter location.
	* PropertyGridView.cs: Bug 78196, font size, and splitter location.

2006-04-25  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIWin32.cs (DIBtoImage): ORing instead of ANDing the alpha
	  into the palette entries. Also, since we're working on a copy
	  we needed to copy the palette back onto the bitmap.
	* Cursor.cs: Same fix as XplatUIWin32.cs.

2006-04-25  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ImageListStreamer.cs: Need to read the var (or we're off)

2006-04-25  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextControl.cs, ComboBox.cs, CommonDialog.cs, Theme.cs, 
	  XplatUIWin32.cs, RichTextBox.cs, ImageListStreamer.cs,
	  TextBoxBase.cs: Unused var fixes
	* AxHost.cs: Small 2.0 fix
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Switched to IntPtr from int for XA_CARDINAL atoms 
	  as it seems that is what at least Metacity expects. This will make
	  icons show up on 64bit platforms. We still have some 64bit size
	  issues, though, since the startup app window size still won't match.

2006-04-25  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* *.cs: cleanup newly reported exception var unused warnings.

2006-04-25  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Button image alignment now matches exactly
	  ms

2006-04-25  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Fixed drawing code for buttons with an
	  image. The image position is always the same, no matter if the
	  button is pressed or not.

2006-04-25  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: SaveFileDialog shouldn't rely on a MWFFileView
	  selection and set the correct filename for SaveFileDialog.
	  Patch by Emery Conrad.

2006-04-24  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs (LastVisibleIndex): when in List mode of Alignment.Left,
	check for item.X outside the ClientRect instead of item.Y. Fixes
	#78151.

2006-04-21 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ImageListStreamer.cs: some images store a wrong grow factor, so don't
	trust that value blindly and do some sanity check. Fixes bug #77814.

2006-04-21 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ImageListStreamer.cs: save the mask as a 1bpp image.

2006-04-21  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* CheckedListBox.cs: maintain CheckStatus here. Use DrawItemState to
	pass Checked and Indeterminate to the Theme Engine. Improve
	encapsulation with ListBox.
	* ListBox.cs: Keep a StringFormat instead of calculating it every item
	draw. Kill ListBoxItem. Refactor away the ListBoxInfo and ListBoxItem
	nested types.  Move all CheckState functionality to CheckedListBox.
	Make IntegralHeight work like MS.  Rewrite of Layout engine.  Fix
	OwnerDrawVariable layout/rendering.  Fix multicolumn rendering.  Fix
	ScrollAlwaysVisible handling. Refactor "selected" collections to use a
	single base list. Fix scrollbar sizing and placement to mirror MS.
	* Theme.cs: remove CheckedListBoxCheckRectangle. It wasn't really
	used.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: implement Indeterminate CheckState rendering
	for CheckedListBox by using new DrawItemState info.  Center the
	checkboxes on the items. Use new StringFormat property.

2006-04-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: MdiChildren don't do default locations the same way as
	regular forms.  This prevents a crash when trying to position the
	mdi windows.

2006-04-17  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* PropertyGridTextBox.cs: Formatting, copyright
	* PropertiesTab.cs: Formatting
	* PropertyGrid.cs: Formatting
	* PropertyGridView.cs: Formatting, fix drop down, enabled double 
	  click toggling of values
	  
2006-04-17  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* KeyPressEventArgs: Added 2.0 only setter for KeyChar
	* Control.cs (.ctor): verify_thread_handle is static, don't reset
	  every time a control is created
	* Application.cs: Removed obsolete EnableRTLMirroring method

2006-04-18  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TabControl.cs: Avoid ArgumentOutOfRangeException when setting
	SelectedIndex to -1. Fixes bug #78121.

2006-04-17  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Binding.cs: Handle null values for Current and BindingContext.
	This occurs when binding is a little delayed.
	* CurrencyManager.cs: return null for Current when there are no
	items in the list.
	- Hookup to the listchanged event on the DataView and update
	bindings when the list is changed.  This fixes late binding of
	controls.

2006-04-17  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs:
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Drops should not create a mousedown. Patch by Tim
	Ringenbach.

2006-04-15  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Draw disabled combo button in the correct
	  place
	* ComboBox.cs: If the combobox is disabled call CPDrawComboButton
	  with the correct ButtonState

2006-04-14  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Improved distinguishing between window types to
	  tell the WM a type closer to what the app wants (Fixes #78107)

2006-04-14  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Fixed drawing of ContainerGrabHandle and
	  GrabHandle

2006-04-14  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Fixed size grip drawing and updated StatusBar
	  drawing code to reflect the size grip changes

2006-04-13 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ImageListStreamer.cs: fix handling of the mask that follows the main
	bitmap when deserializing and serialize it properly. The generated mask
	should better be a 1bpp image, but I'll do that later.

2006-04-13  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Show something in the DirComboBox on *nix if the
	  path doesn't fit into some of our Current.Places

2006-04-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Use borders instead of drawing our own decorations,
	try to obey correct rules for heights.
	* Theme.cs:
	* ThemeNice.cs:
	* ThemeClearLooks.cs:
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Remove combobox decoration drawing code,
	this is now handled by borders.
	- Remove unused DrawListBoxDecorationSize method.
	
2006-04-13  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: null guarding for the disbled click check fixes crash
	reported by Alex.

2006-04-13  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: 
	  - Fixed CPDrawStringDisabled
	  - Corrected drawing of disabled menu items
	  - Fixed drawing of disabled radio buttons (bug #78095)
	  - Draw check in a disabled CheckBox with color ControlDark 

2006-04-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: Use the provided width when calculating the menu size;
	  when being maximized we get WM_NCCALCSIZE before WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED
	  and ClientSize.Width won't be updated yet
	* Application.cs: Use Visible instead of Show() to make form visible,
	  this way we create the handle later and menusize is considered

2006-04-12  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: ignore clicks on disabled menu items. Thanks to Alex for
	reporting.

2006-04-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextBox.cs: Implemented context menu

2006-04-12  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: implement box selection. fixes #77838.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: draw box select rect, remove a ResetClip.

2006-04-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Added setting of window type when transient window
	  is created (metacity would move it otherwise)
	* X11Structs.cs: Added WINDOW_TYPE atoms
	* LinkLabel.cs: Override OnPaintBackgroundInternal and draw the
	  background (the control is Opaque but still wants transparent
	  backgrounds)

2006-04-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Added OnPaintBackgroundInternal to allow controls
	  that set Opaque but don't mean it (like all ButtonBase-derived
	  controls) to still draw their background
	* ButtonBase.cs: Override OnPaintBackgroundInternal and draw
	  the background

2006-04-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs (PaintControlBackground): Set the graphics object
	  on our PaintEvent to null to prevent it from being disposed
	  when the PaintEvent gets disposed

2006-04-12  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Use even more SystemBrushes and SystemPens
	* ThemeNice.cs, ThemeClearlooks.cs: fix typo

2006-04-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: 
	  - Added transparency check to BackColor property. Transparent
	    backgrounds are only allowed if the control styles permit it
	  - Added recursive painting of parent control background and
	    foreground if a control with a transparent backcolor is drawn
	    (Thanks to Tim Ringenback for providing his 'hack' as a base
	     for this patch) Fixes #77985 and #78026.
	  - Added Opaque style check before calling OnPaintBackground, no
	    need to draw the background if the control is opaque
	  - Removed ControlAccessibleObject owner variable (inherited from
	    base, no need to define again)
	  - Added some documentation links explaining the drawing events
	    and styles

2006-04-11  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Splitter.cs (CalculateSplitPosition): Corrected the bad assumption
	  that the affected control is the located at the left border of our
	  parent (Fixes #77936)

2006-04-11  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: When rendering disabled or readonly controls,
	  draw the background with 'Control' instead of 'Window' color as
	  long as the user hasn't specifically set a color

2006-04-11  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Don't try to shortcut by checking against base.Text
	  since that won't be updated if the user types text (only if it's
	  programatically set)

2006-04-11  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ScrollableControl.cs: Calculate DisplayRect dynamically, so that
	  layout changes do to app-triggered resizes will have the proper
	  display rectangle for layout

2006-04-11  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	  - Make use of the SystemBrushes and SystemPens wherever possible
	  - Corrected some highlight colors
	  - Corrected RadioButton and CheckBox FlatStyle.Flat and Popup
	    drawing
	* Theme.cs: Added Empty field to CPColor struct

2006-04-11  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ScrollabeControl.cs: We need to consider whether or not a scrollbar
	  is displayed when calculating the display rectangle. Thanks to Mike
	  for teaching me the err of my ways.

2006-04-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ScrollableControl.cs:
	  - Rewrote DisplayRectangle code, now returning the proper x/y coords 
	    (instead of 0,0) and we now return the real width/height instead of
	    just the clientrectangle, adjusted for padding. The rectangle is
	    now cached and created by the new CalculateDisplayRectangle method.
	  - Created new CalculateDisplayRectange method, which basically does
	    what get_DisplayRectangle() did originally, but now using the 
	    right edge instead of DisplayRectangle to determine the size of
	    our scrollbars
	  - get_Canvas(): Fixed it to properly calculate canvas for 
	    right/bottom controls which seem to be placed to the right/bottom
	    of any controls that have a fixed location
	  - Removed TODO that's taken care of
	  - Removed NotImplementeds and attempted to implement AdjustFormScrollBars
	    and SetDisplayRectLocation according to new MSDN2 docs
	  - Added call to PerformLayout in OnVisibleChanged, MS causes a layout
	    event when that is called, this is added for compatibility
	  - ScrollControlIntoView(): Implemented.
	  - Switched scrollbars to be implicit, they shouldn't be selectable
	* ContainerControl: Now that ScrollControlIntoView is implemented, we 
	  call it when the active control is set/changed
	* ScrollBar.cs: Added support for generating Win32 scrollbar messages
	* ImplicitHScrollBar.cs, ImplicitVScrollBar.cs: Now setting new base
	  implicit_control variable (used for native Win32 message generation)
	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs: Added new 
	  HorizontalScrollBarHeight and VerticalScrollBarWidth properties
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Now calling the driver for the scrollbar sizes
	* XplatUIStructs.cs: Added ScrollBarCommands enum

2006-04-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ButtonBase.cs:
	* CheckedListBox.cs:
	* ComboBox.cs:
	* DataGrid.cs:
	* DataGridView.cs:
	* Form.cs:
	* GroupBox.cs:
	* ListBox.cs:
	* PrintPreviewControl.cs:
	* ProgressBar.cs:
	* PropertyGrid.cs:
	* Splitter.cs:
	* StatusBar.cs:
	* TrackBar.cs:
	* UpDownBase.cs: Fixup base event overrides.
	
2006-04-06  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs: fix "new event" declarations (#76509) and bounds check
	all user-initiated value changes to min <= value <= max-thumbsz+1.
	(set_Value): check for vert/horiz when calculating new thumb position.
	(LargeIncrement): bounds check to stop pos at max - thumb_size + 1
	like MS does.
	(OnMouseMoveSB): refactor the thumb dragging code and refine
	invalidation logic to reduce flicker.
	(SetEndPosition): bounds check to stop pos at max - thumb_size + 1
	(SmallIncrement): bounds check to stop pos at max - thumb_size + 1
	(UpdateThumbPosition): small code readability cleanup

2006-04-10  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeNice.cs: Small UI polishing. Draw borders a little bit
	  different

2006-04-08  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeNice.cs: Use a better graphics effect when a button is pressed

2006-04-08  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* Theme.cs: Added GetDashPen and GetSizedPen to SystemResPool
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Make use of the new SystemResPool methods.
	  This dramatically reduces the number of Pen.Dispose calls. 
	  Where possible call ResPool methods only once instead of calling it
	  over and over again (for example for the same color).

2006-04-06  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* TabControl.cs: fix for SelectedIndex updating on TabPage removals.
	Also remove an unused private field on the collection. Fixes #77972.

2006-04-06  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeNice.cs: Added ToolBar drawing code

2006-04-06  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Form.cs (ShowDialog): MS allows IWin32Window param to be a non-form.
	I'm assuming that means we need to look up the toplevel for the
	provided control. Fixes the crash trace in #77911 but exposes another
	crash in some strange reflection usage in NDocGui.

2006-04-06  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeNice.cs: Gave it a little silver touch and added Images
	  method
	* FontDialog.cs: FontDialog is not resizable
	* FileDialg.cs: Added SizeGripStyle.Show

2006-04-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* KeyboardLayouts.cs: Remove warning.

2006-04-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Enable OnPaintInternal so we can use it for drawing
	all of our controls instead of Paint +=.
	* ListBox.cs:
	* ListView.cs:
	* MenuAPI.cs:
	* MessageBox.cs:
	* NotifyIcon.cs:
	* ProgressBar.cs:
	* ScrollBar.cs:
	* Splitter.cs:
	* StatusBar.cs:
	* TabControl.cs:
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	* ToolBar.cs:
	* TrackBar.cs:
	* UpDownBase.cs:
	* ComboBox.cs: Remove handling of WM_PAINT and WM_ERASEBKGND and
	use OnPaintInternal. Remove Width/Height and Visible checks in
	paint handler, this is done at a higher level now.
	* GroupBox.cs: Don't need to handle WM_ERASEBKGND anymore.
	* PaintEventArgs.cs: Add a handled flag so controls that don't
	want anymore painting after OnPaintInternal can make sure OnPaint
	isn't called.

2006-04-05  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: fix the menu WndProc hacks to respect the native enabled
	state of the form, so that we don't process events when Modal dialogs
	are up. Fixes #77922.

2006-04-05  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* Mime.cs: Default for range length is 1 not 0. If set to 0 no match
	  checking is done.

2006-04-05  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: fix typo in the EX_APPWINDOW transient patch.

2006-04-05  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs (HeaderMouseMove): null guarding for the over column
	when setting up the drag_to_index.  Fixes #78015.

2006-04-04  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: If WS_EX_APPWINDOW isn't set we don't want to show up
	  in the taskbar. Transient windows seem to accomplish that.

2006-04-04  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs:
	  - Re-enabled CreateParams.X/Y code for FormStartPosition
	  - Added code for manual placement when creating the Control
	  - Incomplete patch to treat MDI forms differently when
	    setting the ClientSizeCore. (Still need to figure out handling
	    x/y coords there)
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - When we're explicitly setting the X/Y position of a non-Child
	    window, let the WM know. Metacity really wants this.

2006-04-04  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeNice.cs: Added CPDrawButton

2006-04-04  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeNice.cs: Changed the color for focused buttons and activated
	  the arrows for small scroll buttons.

2006-04-04  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Removed DrawFlatStyleButton, not needed
	  anymore. Changed some method modifiers to protected (virtual)
	* ThemeClearlooks.cs: Updated to reflect the ThemeWin32Classic
	  changes
	* ThemeNice.cs: Updated to reflect the ThemeWin32Classic changes.
	  Updated drawing of menus, buttons and progressbars; added
	  CPDrawBorder3D 

2006-04-03 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ImageListStreamer.cs: implemented serialization/deserialization
	of the images.

2006-04-03  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	  - Removed all the DrawFrameControl stuff; CPDrawButton,
	    CPDrawCheckBox and CPDrawRadioButton are now handled directly
	    inside the methods
	  - Updated and corrected the drawing code of CPDrawButton,
	    CPDrawCheckBox and CPDrawRadioButton to better match ms
	  - Updated theme checkbox and radiobutton code to use the CP*
	    methods

2006-03-31  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Enable clipping again now that the libgdiplus
	  bug is fixed

2006-03-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Somehow we get SETCURSORS for bad windows
	sometimes.
	* UpDownBase.cs: Don't CreateGraphics manually, use a
	Refresh. Ideally we would invalidate the correct areas here.

2006-03-31  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: 
	  - We now track the mapping state of windows. If a window (or 
	    one of it's parents) is not mapped we no longer permit
	    WM_PAINT messages to be generated since we'd otherwise get 
	    lots of BadMatch X errors. Jackson did all the work figuring
	    out the problem.
	  - Destroying the caret if the window it's contained in is 
	    destroyed. Can't use regular DestroyCaret method since it
	    might fall into a drawing function (trying to remove the
	    caret) and with that generate new BadMatch errors. Again,
	    Jackson tracked this down.
	  - Changed DestroyChildWindows to SendWMDestroyMessages, we now
	    make sure we send the messages to all windows. (The old code
	    would send the WM_DESTROY to the window, and then all child
	    windows would be 'gone' because the WM_DESTROY handle lookup
	    would no longer find the destroyed window)
	* Hwnd.cs: Added Mapping property to track mapping state of hwnd
	* X11Structs.cs: Added WindowType enum for MapWindow/UnmapWindow

2006-03-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ScrollableControl.cs: Dont recalc if we are not visible.

2006-03-31  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (SetVisibleCore): move the CreateControl call up ahead of
	the visibility branch.

2006-03-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs: Cap values when incrementing/decrementing.

2006-03-31  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: setup menu.tracker for popup/context menus.
	* ToolTip.cs: guard against timer expirations with no active control.
	Not sure why it happened.

2006-03-31  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: add some horizontal padding space for the tip
	text.
	* ToolTip.cs: Position the tooltip based on where the cursor is at
	popup time, not at MouseEnter time.  Add a Down state so that we don't
	redisplay tips without a Leave. Use faked XplatUI.GetCursorInfo for
	positioning offset. Lookup DisplaySize at positioning time, since it
	can theoretically change during invocation.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: fake GetCursorInfo until pdb can do it properly.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: fake GetCursorInfo until pdb can do it properly.

2006-03-31  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Use CPDrawBorder3D to draw a GroupBox.
	  Fixes behaviour when the Text property of the box is String.Empty

2006-03-31  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Only send mouseleave for our client windows, not
	  for the whole window (otherwise we get WM_MOUSE_LEAVE twice for
	  a window)

2006-03-31  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Visual enhancement for the popup buttons in 
	  PopupButtonPanel

	  highlighted menu items to match ms

2006-03-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Don't set a clip rectangle unless it's not empty

2006-03-30  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Menu.cs (SelectedItem): use new MenuItem.Selected prop.
	* MenuAPI.cs: use new MenuItem.Selected prop. redraw MainMenu when we
	go active to account for HotLight to Selected transition.
	* MenuItem.cs: add internal Selected prop. Fill out the Status
	property by calculating it from item info. Add HotLight,
	NoAccelerator, Checked, Grayed, and Disabled flags where appropriate.

2006-03-30  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MenuItem.cs: only emit DrawItem and MeasureItem for OwnerDraw.

2006-03-29  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: Implement TODO.

2006-03-29  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* PrintPreviewDialog.cs: Implemented missing methods and events; still
	  missing proper dialog setup in the constructor

2006-03-29  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ProgressBar.cs: Added 2.0 Style property that apps seem to use
	* Control.cs:
	  - Implemented CheckForIllegalCrossThreadCalls, removed TODO
	  - Fixed ResetBindings and removed TODO
	  - Added check for cross-thread calls to get_Handle()
	  - Added Marshaller attribute for set_Font to satisfy class status
	* FontDialog.cs: Removed TODOs that seemed implemented

	* MessageBox.cs: Implemented support for Default button and removed TODO
	* FileDialog.cs: Removed obsolete TODO
	* DomainUpDown.cs: Removed obsolete TODO
	* ButtonBase.cs: Removed obsolete TODO
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Removed obsolete TODO
	* Form.cs:
	  - Removed obsolete TODO
	  - Calling CheckAcceptButton when the acceptbutton is changed to allow
	    internal status updates
	  - Making sure the active control is selected when the control is created
	* CurrencyManager.cs: Removed obsolete TODO

2006-03-29  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* *.cs: fix remaining corcompare issues for 1.1 API with the exception
	of PrintPreviewDialog and RichTextBox.

2006-03-29  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* Theme.cs: Added a little helper to SystemResPool to get the Dark,
	  DarkDark, Light and LightLight colors for a specific color
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	  - Use Button drawing code to draw RadioButtons and CheckBoxes with
	    Appearance = Button 
	  - Make use of the new ResPool helper CPColor
	  - Draw ProgressBar and StatusBar with correct 3D borders

2006-03-29  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ColorDialog.cs: Return selected color. Fixes bug #77940.

2006-03-28  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: fix Icon layout to plan for scrollbar widths when
	calculating col/row counts.

2006-03-28  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ColumnHeader.cs:
	* ListView.cs:
	* ListViewItem.cs:
	* Menu.cs: 
	switch to explicit interface method implementation for some methods
	corcompare identifies as inconsistent with MS.

2006-03-28  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MainMenu.cs: 
	* Menu.cs:
	add a few missing methods from the class status output.

2006-03-28  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ControlPaint.cs: Fixed ControlPaint.Light method. Results are now
	  correct.

2006-03-28  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Deactivate on MainMenu item click. Fixes #77917.

2006-03-27  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Switch flat toolbars to use RaisedInner for
	the Hilight state to adapt to Alex's CPDrawBorder3D changes.

2006-03-27  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Rewrote Button drawing code to match ms.

2006-03-25  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	  - GroupBox: Inserted a little gap between the text and the lines
	    on the right side
	  - Made the code in CPDrawBorder3D more readable
	  - Corrected the drawing location of the up and down arrows in 
	    CPDrawScrollButton

2006-03-25  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ControlPaint.cs: Corrected line widths in DrawBorder for
	  ButtonBorderStyle Inset and Outset

2006-03-25  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	  - Rewrote the totally broken CPDrawBorder3D method. That was
	    one of the main problems for the terrific ThemeWin32Classic
	    look
	  - Updated and corrected Button drawing
	  - Correct the dimensions of the SizeGrip to match ms ones
	  - Removed a small drawing glitch in DrawComboBoxEditDecorations
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Draw borders with BorderStyle = Fixed3D with
	  Border3DStyle.Sunken to match ms.

2006-03-25  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:	First small part of the "de-uglify
	  ThemeWin32Classic" effort, SizeGrip

2006-03-24  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Give a max idle time of one second, this matches
	MS and forces an Idle event every second when there are no other
	events in the queue.

2006-03-24  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: Handle (Large|Small)ImageList == null more robustly.
	* ListView.Item.cs: fix layout issues with null image lists and images
	smaller than checkbox size.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Draw a 12 pixel line in ListView LargeIcon
	mode like MS does.  It's weird, but consistent.  ;-)
	Fixes #77890.

2006-03-24  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: Scroll wheel support for the item control.  Fixes
	#77839.

2006-03-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ScrollableControl.cs: Special case negative sized areas, not
	zero.
	* MonthCalendar.cs: Save the rect of the clicked date so we can
	use it for invalidation.
	- Try to cut down on the number of invalidates
	- Invalidate the rect the mouse is over and was over when moving
	the mouse, so we get the focus box following the cursor.

2006-03-23  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: fix FullRowSelect selection background and
	focus rectangle drawing. Fixes #77835.

2006-03-23  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: rework the fix for #77828 by changing the order of
	the if and else if and reverting back to the original == check on the
	None conditional.

2006-03-23  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FontDialog.cs: Update the example panel if the selected index of
	  the fontListBox changes.

2006-03-23  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Make FileDialog remember which directory it was in
	  last in the same execution.

2006-03-22  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: make the DropDownMenu on the toolbar display
	RadioChecks since they are mutually exclusive and that's what MS does.

2006-03-22  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Theme.cs: add Color param to CPDrawMenuGlyph.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: do color specific menu glyph rendering so that
	checks and radio marks and arrows are visible on highlighted items.
	* ControlPaint.cs: update to use new Theme signature.

2006-03-22  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: only process Enter and arrow keypresses if the tracker
	is active. Fixes #77870.

2006-03-22  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Corrected TabIndex order and set fileNameComboBox
	  to be focused/selected after startup

2006-03-22  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ColorDialog.cs: 
	  - Corrected behaviour of Color, AllowFullOpen, FullOpen,
	    CustomColors and ShowHelp properties
	  - Some internal rewrites to get better results when using the
	    ColorMatrix

2006-03-22  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: hook into Peter's new ResetMouseHover capability to fix
	HoverSelection.  Fixes #77836.

2006-03-22  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: bugfixes for the toolbar.  Use PushButtons instead of
	ToggleButtons.  (De)Sensitize the Back button around a stack count of
	1, not 0.  Update ButtonSize based on a pixel count of the win32
	control.  Adjust the toolbar size/location for new button size.

2006-03-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Don't handle configurenotifys if PostQuitState is
	true.
	* ScrollBar.cs: When doing increments and decrements we need to
	set the Value property so that ValueChanged gets raised. A
	possible optimization here would be to make an internal SetValue
	that doesn't invalidate immediately.
	* ToolTip.cs: Tooltips get added to their container (when
	supplied) so they get disposed when the container is disposed.
	- Don't create tooltips for String.Empty. This prevents all these
	little 2-3 pixel windows from showing up when running nunit-gui
	and driving me mad.
	* Form.cs: Don't set topmost when setting the owner if the handles
	haven't been created yet.  The topmost set will happen when the
	handles are created.

2006-03-22  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - DeriveWindowStyles: Fixed typo in borderstyle generation (#77828)
	  - SetVisible: Sending WINDOWPOSCHANGED for all controls when made 
	    visible (to allow them to recalculate their sizes)

2006-03-21  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: major refactoring of the ToolBar rendering
	methods. Removed a ton of redundant code.  Still not really happy with
	the border rendering, but I think that's mainly because of the
	ControlDarkDark being black instead of a dark grey. Depending on how 
	close we want to be, we might want to revisit those color choices.
	Among the new features added during the refactor were DropDownArrow
	pressed rendering, Disabled image rendering.  Proper flat appearance
	boundary rendering.  Removed the Divider and Wrapping dividers since I
	can't figure out any combination of themes and conditions to make the
	MS control draw a horizontal line on a toolbar despite what the
	Divider property docs indicate.
	* ToolBar.cs: rewrite the layout engine. Fixes numerous flicker
	conditions and incorrect layout.  Updated to coding standard.
	* ToolBarButton.cs: refactored layout and positioning code from
	ToolBar to here.  Invalidate wherever possible instead of forcing
	redraws of the whole toolbar. 
	(Known remaining issues: explicit ButtonSize smaller than provided
	images.)

2006-03-21  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ContextMenu.cs (Show): use the position parameter instead of just
	showing at the MousePosition.

2006-03-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Remove the call to ProcessKeyEventArgs and let
	control handle this.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: If we are clearing the root node we need
	to reset top_node so calcs can still happen.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: This is a Flags so we need to check
	properly.
	
2006-03-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: Create columns when the binding context has been
	changed.
	* X11Structs.cs: Keysyms are uints.
	- Add size to fix build.

2006-03-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs, 
	  XplatUIOSX.cs: 
	  - Added ResetMouseHover method to allow controls to retrigger
	    hovering if they need it more than once
	  - Implemented MouseHoverTime and MouseHoverSize properties
	* Timer.cs: Start() must reset the interval
	* SystemInformation.cs: Added 2.0 MouseHoverTime and MouseHoverSize
	  properties

2006-03-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Keyboard.cs: improved layout detection. Move the nonchar
	tables into this file.
	* KeyboardLayouts.cs: Move the tables into resource files.

2006-03-21  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: use OnItemActivated to raise events. Fixes #77834.

2006-03-21  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* Mime.cs: Various speed optimizations. Looking up mime types
	  is now 2 times faster than before

2006-03-17  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* CreateParams.cs: Added internal menu field
	* Control.cs: 
	  - Switched call order for UpdateBounds; now we always call
	    the one that also takes ClientSize, and we're calculating the 
	    client size via driver method in the others. The previous
	    method of tracking client size by difference wasn't working
	    for forms where even the starting client size wouldn't match
	    the overall form size (due to borders) (Part of fix for #77729)
	  - CreateParams(): Do not use parent.Handle unless the handle is
	    already created. Causes havoc with Nexxia and throws off our
	    creation of controls
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Created new PerformNCCalc method to trigger WM_NCCALCSIZE message
	  - Switched handling of ConfigureNotify over to new PerformNCCalc 
	    method (consolidates code)
	  - Changed RequestNCRecalc to use new PerformNCCalc method
	  - Added calls to RequestNCRecalc when menus and borders are changed
	    to allow app to set NC size. (Part of fix for #77729) This matches
	    when MS send a WM_NCRECALC on Win32 windows.
	  - Now sending WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED when toplevel for is made visible
	    (Part of fix for #77729). This matches what MS does, they also
	    send that message when the form is made visible.
	  - XException.GetMessage: Improved usability of X errors by including
	    a translation of the window into Hwnd and Control class
	  - Improved debug info for window creation, reparenting and destruction
	  - Created helper method WindowIsMapped() [Currently not used]
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Added ToString() debug helper to RECT structure
	* Form.cs:
	  - CreateParams: Now setting our menu on the new internal menu field
	  - SetClientSizeCore: Now passing cp.menu instead of ActiveMenu to
	    avoid calculating the same property twice
	* Hwnd.cs:
	  - Improved usability of ToString() for debugging purposes
	  - GetWindowRectangle(): Now uses proper CalcMenuBarSize method to
	    determine the height of the menu, instead of just the font. This
	    required to also create a graphics context and to keep a bmp 
	    around (for performance reasons)

2006-03-17  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Added OnMouseUp method
	* Form.cs:
	  - Now remembering the requested client size, avoids size errors
	  - WndProc: Now handling WM_xBUTTONUP and passing it to MenuTracker
	    instead of base if the menu is active. This is required due to
	    control now capturing and releasing on down/up and it would
	    prematurely release our menu capture

2006-03-17  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* KeyboardLayouts.cs: Add the czech layouts.

2006-03-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Use the viewport space when sizing not the controls
	client size, so things like ScrollableControl that effect the
	viewport size (when scrollbars are added) are computed correctly.
	* BindingContext.cs: Cleanup to use the DataSourceEntrys instead
	of ManagerEntrys.
	- Handle creating BindingManagers for null data sources.
	* DataGrid.cs: Bind the cached_currencymgr_events to the real data
	source, otherwise when rows are added they are added to the 'fake'
	datasource and we will crash when trying to set the position in
	those rows.
	- Use Implicit scrollbars on the datagrid so they arent
	selectable.
	
2006-03-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Binding.cs:
	* InternalWindowManager.cs:
	* MdiWindowManager.cs:
	* X11Keyboard.cs: I really want Mike to love me again (fix
	compiler warnings).

2006-03-16  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* DataGrid.cs:
	  - OnMouseDown: Switch to editing mode when clicking on the cell
	                 even if we're clicking on the cell that's currently 
	                 selected
	  - ProcessGridKey: Left/Right now wrap like MS.Net does
	  - ProcessGridKey: Tab now knows to add a new row when tab is
	                    pressed in the cell of the last column of the 
	                    last row
	  - ProcessGridKey: Enter now adds another row  if pressed in the last
	                    row and selectes the new row, same column cell
	  - ProcessGridKey: Home/End navigate columns, not rows, like 
	                    originally implemented
	  - Broke ProcessKeyPreview code out into an extra Internal method
	    so it can be called from the edit code
	* DataGridTextBox.cs (ProcessKeyMessage):
	  - Switched to accept Tab keypresses
	  - Added F2 handling to allow jumping to the end of the edited cell
	  - Added logic to allow moving caret left/right inside edited cell
	    and making the edited cell jump when the caret hits cell borders
	  - Tab and Enter are now passed to the datagrid after being handled
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Removed capture code now that Control handles it
	  - set_SelectionStart now ensures caret is visible

2006-03-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TrackBar.cs: Debackwards the increment/decrement for handling
	mouse clicks on the bar with vertical trackbars.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Draw vertical trackbars with 0 at the
	bottom to match MS.

2006-03-16  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: make shift/ctrl keyboard and mouse selection 
	consistent with the MS control. Fix a bug in
	SelectedListViewItemCollection.Clear that was pissing me off for the
	better part of a day because the collection was being altered
	underneath us as we walked the list.

2006-03-16  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: Not sure how we could miss this so long, but it seems
	  that MS.Net has Capture set all the way from before calling 
	  OnMouseDown through sending the mouse events until after
	  OnMouseUp. This will fix DataGrid's selection being set to end
	  at the location of the MouseUp.

2006-03-15  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* BindingContext.cs: Check the binding after its added so that it
	  can initialize the binding managers and hookup to events.
	* Binding.cs: Data members seem to sometimes include rows/cols in
	  the format Row.Column we now take this into account.
	  - Hookup to the position changed event so we can update the
	  control when the position has changed in the data set.
	* CurrencyManager.cs: Take into account the row/col naming
	  convention when creating dataset tables.
	* BindingContext.cs: Using a newer better way of storing
	  datasource/datamember pairs.  Hopefully this better matches MS for
          looking up binding managers.


2006-03-15  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* BindingContext.cs: The currency manager needs the data member
	name, if the member is a data set we use the name to find the
	correct table.
	* CurrencyManager.cs: When creating the list prefer an IList over
	an IListSource.
	- Attempt to create a DataTable from a DataSet (TODO: might need
	some better error checking here, although MS doesn't seem to have much)
	- If we have a DataTable create a view and use it as our list.

2006-03-15  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: keep a matrix of the icon mode layout to facilitate
	keyboard navigation. Support Up/Down/Left/Right selection correctly
	for all 4 View modes.
	* ListViewItem.cs: add internal row/col fields for icon layouts.

2006-03-15  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Redraw the tabs when we resize so their newly
	calculated sizes are drawn on screen.
	* X11Keyboard.cs: Begginnings of XIM support.  We also now support
	composite characters.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Keyboard driver needs to know about focus changes
	- filter events so that composite characters can be created
	patches by peter
	* X11Structs.cs: Add XIMProperties enum.

2006-03-14  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs (BringToFront, SendToBack): Don't use window or handle
	  unless it's created

2006-03-14  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (PerformLayout): We don't need to consider visiblity
	  for anchoring, only for docking. This fixes 'whacky' alignment
	  in listbox and other controls that use implicit scrollbars after
	  the previous PerformLayout patch
	* ListBox.cs: Switched to use implicit scrollbars
	  
2006-03-14  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ToolBar.cs: 
	* VScrollBar.cs:
	- chain up the "new event" overrides to base and use
	OnEvent to raise them.  Part of fix for bug #76509.

2006-03-14  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Do not select an item in the parent directory
	  on backspace

2006-03-14  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs (PerformLayout): It would seem that we considered
	  invisible windows for our layout. Not quite the right thing
	  to do. Now we don't any longer, thereby fixing bug #76889.

2006-03-14  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (CanFocus): I goofed. A control can have focus 
	  even though it's not selectable. Made it match MS docs.

2006-03-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ControlPaint.cs (DrawBorder3D): DrawBorder3D does not fill the
	  center by default (fixes #76895)
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs, ThemeNice.cs, ThemeClearlooks.cs: Replaced 
	  all uses of Border3DSides.All with the explicit ORd together
	  Left|Right|Top|Bottom because I assume that nobody was aware 
	  that All also implies a center fill. Most places I checked had
	  a fill right above.
	* ProgressBarStyle.cs: Added

2006-03-13  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: fix breakage in drag shadow header positioning 
	from Peter's csc compilation fix.

2006-03-13  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: fix NRE produced by backspacing twice in a focused
	FileDialog.

2006-03-13  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: proxy Key(Down|Up) from ItemControl to ListView.

2006-03-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Hwnd.cs: Added fixed_size field to track windows whose size cannot
	  be changed
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Now setting fixed_size on hwnd and if set, re-setting
	  the allowed size before making programmatic size changes

2006-03-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Don't call XSetWMNormalHints if no flags are 
	  set, metacity is broken and will still use the emty sizes in 
	  the struct. (Fix for #77089)

2006-03-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIStructs.cs: Split WindowStyles into WindowStyles and 
	  WindowExStyles and marked both enums as Flags
	* Form.cs, ComboBox.cs, ToolTip.cs, Control.cs, PropertyGridView.cs,
	  NotifyIcon.cs, MenuAPI.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs, MonthCalendar.cs: Updated
	  to match WindowStyles split
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - SetWMStyles: Added cehck to not apply WM attributes to Child windows
	  - Updated to match WindowStyles split
	* XplatUIWin32.cs:
	  - Fixed FosterParent creation, was using ExStyle on the Style field
	    (This should help with Popup focus issues)
	  - Updated to match WindowStyles split

2006-03-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Use the system menu height. Fixes some
	strange sizing issues.

2006-03-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: Need to scroll to caret after text is inserted (#77672)
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Scroll to caret after inserting text (#77672)
	  - Make scroll range one pixel higher, fixes off-by-one error (and
	    makes underlines visible on the last line)

2006-03-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Added call to new Keyboard.ResetKeyState to prevent
	  the keyboard state from being stuck with keys in 'pressed' state when
	  focus is switched away via keyboard
	* X11Keyboard.cs: Added new ResetKeyState method to allow drivers to
	  reset the keyboard if no X11 KeyUp events are expected to come
	* X11Structs.cs: Switched type of Visible to bool to match driver

2006-03-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs:
	  - Switched caret to be just 1 pixel wide, matches MS and looks less
	    clunky
	  - Moved caret display 1 pixel down from the top of the control
	    to improve view
	  - InsertCharAtCharet: Update the selection start if moving the caret
	    (fixes bug #77696; based on patch suggested by kazuki@panicode.com)
	  - No longer always creating the caret when the caret methods are
	    called. Only the actual ShowCaret/HideCaret will do that now
	  - Only setting caret visible if the owner control has focus
	  - UpdateView: Added invalidation-shortcut logic for center and right 
	    aligned text. Previously we'd update all according to the left
	    logic which caused drawing errors. Also fixed height of invalidated
	    areas, now properly invalidating the whole area (was off-by-one)
	  - owner_HandleCreated: Always generate the document when the
	    handle is created; this ensures that 
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Fixed situation where caret would disappear under the right
	    window border, also improved scrolling behaviour on left-
	    aligned textboxes
	  - Fixed right-aligned textboxes to have a border to the
	    right instead of the caret being under the right border
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Switched from 'nested' to simple visible/not visible tracking 
	    for caret (part of fix for #77671)
	  - No longer passing through translated FocusIn/FocusOut messages
	    since we were notifying too often and the wrong windows. Instead
	    we just notify our focussed window of receiving or loosing focus
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Switched from 'nested' show/hide 
	  counting for caret to simple visible yes/no behaviour (part of 
	  fix for #77671)

2006-03-11  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* Mime.cs: Remove debug code...

2006-03-11  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeGenerated.cs: Removed
	* Mime.cs: Mime now reads the mime data (magic, globs, aliases
	  and subclasses) from /usr/(local/)share/mime and
	  $HOME/.local/share/mime.

2006-03-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Recalc the NC area when a window is
	maximized/restored so that the menu area is drawn on forms that
	don't have a menu.

2006-03-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs,
	  XplatUIX11.cs: Added RequestNCRecalc method to driver to allow
	  us to force a WM_NCCALCRESIZE message being sent. This is needed
	  for MDI maximizing.

2006-03-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: We need to use the ActiveMenu when calculating menu
	height.
	- Fix nullref when the window manager hasn't been created yet.
	* Control.cs: Fix nullref when we try to bring a control to the
	front that has no parent.
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Use the MaximizedMenu for calculating
	height.
	- Add a dummy item to the maximized menu so it always has the
	correct height. Otherwise when there are no menus we don't get our
	icon and buttons.
	

2006-03-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Make this available elsewhere. I need it in some MDI
	stuff.
	* Form.cs: Make the window_state internal so the window managers
	can track it.
	- When an MDI child is maximized let its window manager create the
	main menu (so it can add its icon).
	- Notify the window managers of state changes
	- Let the window manager paint its buttons and handle button
	clicks on the menu when it is maximized.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Move the prev_bounds into the mdi
	window manager, since tool windows don't use it, only mdi windows.
	- Tell the main form that we don't want it to handle NCPAINT
	itself to avoid extra painting.
	- Handle clicks on a maximized windows menu.
	- Handle window state changes
	- Handle minimize/maximize clicks correctly by setting the window state.
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Add an icon menu that (the menu you get
	when clicking on the forms icon).
	- New method to create a forms maximized menu. This is its normal
	menu + an icon.
	- Handle window state changes.
	- Handle sizing of maximized windows.  Maximized windows are just
	drawn bigger then the parent visible area. All controls are still
	there, they are just outside the visible area (this matches windows).
	* MdiClient.cs: No scrollbars when a child window is maximized.
	- Let the children windows figure out how big they should be when
	sizing maximized windows.
	- Implement a version of ArrangeIconicWindows somewhat similar to
	Windows version.  There are some little differences, but I don't
	think any app will rely on the layout of minimized mdi windows.

2006-03-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Padding.cs: Several fixes to allow compiling with csc 2.0

2006-03-09  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Menu.cs:
	* MenuItem.cs: Cheap hack so we can add items to the list without
	the events being raised.  This allows adding mdi items during
	drawing. TODO: Should probably find a better time to add the items.

2006-03-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	  - CheckBox_DrawText: Added logic to not wrap if not enough space
	    is available (Fix for bug #77727)
	  - RadioButton_DrawText: Added logic not to wrap if not enough
	    space is available (Fix for bug #77727). Also removed some
	    duplicate code, DrawString always drawing the regular text
	    before hitting the if statement.

2006-03-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Handle an unmapped window state in SetWindowState

2006-03-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* PictureBox.cs: Implemented ISupportInitialize interface (fixes #77726)
	* ContainerControl.cs: Partial implementation of some 2.0 scaling
	  methods. Moved the new 2.0 properties into alphabetical order with
	  other properties and added MonoTODO tags

2006-03-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* AutoScaleMode.cs: Added. Fix build.

2006-03-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs, 
	  XplatUIOSX.cs: Removed HWnd argument from CalcuateClientRect, not used
	  and was requiring premature handle creation for calls from above
	* Form.cs, Control.cs: Removed handle arguments from calls to
	  CalculateClientRect()

2006-03-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* ListView.cs (HeaderMouseMove): Fix csc compilation. 
	  drag_column.column_rect is MarshalByRef and can't be used that way

2006-03-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* AxHost.cs: Added deserialization constructor for 
	  AxHost+State (fixes 77743)

2006-03-09  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: 
	- Added column drag reordering for details view.
	- fixed behavior when mouse is dragged off column and
	AllowColumnReorder is false.
	* ColumnHeader.cs: clone the format too in Clone.
	* Theme.cs: add DrawListViewHeaderDragDetails method.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	- impl new method for drawing drag column shadows and targets.
	- support column offset for details mode in DrawListViewItem.

2006-03-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Reset the char_count when the document is cleared
	  (Fixes bug reported on mono-winforms mailing list)

2006-03-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Honor the Handled state of KeyPress events. Instead
	  of calling base we simply process the key ourselves, since both
	  DefWindowProc and the handled method would set m.Result. 
	  (Fixes #77732)

2006-03-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Form.cs(ScaleCore): No longer calling base.ScaleCore since that
	  method also moves the window; instead implemented a copy of
	  Control.ScaleCore (Part of fix for #77456)
	* TextBoxBase.cs: 
	  - Created new CreateGraphicsInternal method to allow providing
	    a graphics context when no handle is created without triggering
	    handle creation. (Part of fix for #77456)
	  - Replaced use of Control.CreateGraphics with CreateGraphicsInternal
	* TextControl.cs: 
	  - Switched Constructor to require TextBoxBase instead of Control (to
	    allow uncast access to CreateGraphicsInternal)
	  - Safeguarded use of owner.Handle property. No longer accessing it
	    unless the handle is already created.
	  - Replaced use of Control.CreateGraphics with CreateGraphicsInternal
	  - Now triggering a recalc when owning control becomes visible
	* TextBox.cs, RichTextBox.cs: Switched to use new internal 
	  TextBoxBase.CreateGraphicsInternal() method to avoid triggering
	  premature handle creation (Part of fix for #77456)
	* Control.cs:
	  - We now only destroy our double-buffering buffers when the
	    control is resized or disposed, but not when visibility
	    changes. (The code even re-created them twice every time)
	  - Now requiring a redraw of the buffer on visibility changes
	    (fixes bug 77654 part 2)
	  - Not passing OnParentVisibleChanged up unless the control
	    is visible
	  - CanFocus: Fixed to match MS documentation
	  - Focus: Fixed to return actual focus state and to check if
	    setting focus is legal before setting it

2006-03-08  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: TabPages cannot have focus. Determine
	  when to draw focus rectangle by looking at parent focus and
	  selected state instead. This fixes TabPages on Linux sometimes
	  having none or multiple focus rectangles.
	* XplatUIX11.cs (SetFocus): 
	  - Don't set the focus if the same window already has focus
	  - Use SendMessage instead of PostMessage (like it's Win32
	    equivalent) and send the WM_SETFOCUS before the WM_KILLFOCUS
	    to match MS behaviour
	* TabControl.cs(SelectedIndex): Don't set Focus on TabPage, TabPages
	  are not selectable.

2006-03-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* PictureBox.cs: Revert line I accidently committed last week.

2006-03-07  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: 
	  - Added new IsRecreating and ParentIsRecreating properties to
	    allow testing if RecreateHandle has been called on ourselves
	    or one of our parents
	  - WndProc(WM_DESTROY): If our control handle is being recreated
	    we immediately need to create the handle when receiving the
	    destroy, that way our child windows find a valid parent handle
	    when they themselves are being recreated upon WM_DESTROY receipt
	    (fix for bug #77654 part 1)
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - DestroyWindow: WM_DESTROY must be sent to our own window before
	    notifying any child windows. MS documents that child windows
	    are still valid when WM_DESTROY is received. (Control now relies on
	    this behaviour)
	  - Added some fine-grain debug options

2006-03-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Redid scrolling logic a bit to create a virtual
	box and base calculations off this.
	* MdiChildContext.cs:
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Don't need to ensure scrollbars here
	anymore.
	
2006-03-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Splitter.cs: In situations where the affected control is added
	  to the parent's control list after the splitter, we would not
	  populate affected. Now we try populating it on mousedown, if
	  it's not already set, and force it to be re-set whenever our
	  parent changes.

2006-03-03  Matt Hargett  <matt@use.net>

	* Control.cs: implement Control.Padding
	* Padding.cs: -Padding.All returns -1 when constructing with the
	implicit default ctor
	-Padding.ToString() matches MS.NET
	* ContainerControl.cs: implement
	ContainerControl.AutoScaleDimensions
	* ListControl.cs: implement ListControl.FormattingEnabled
	* TextBox.cs: Implemented TextBox.UseSystemPasswordChar.
	* ButtonBase.cs:
	* TabPage.cs: Implement UseVisualStyleBackColor.
	* PictureBox.cs: Implement PictureBox.InitialImage.

2006-03-03  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: Refactor into HeaderControl and ItemControl. Fix new
	event declarations to proxy to base event.
	* ListViewItem.cs: update to use ItemControl.
	* Theme.cs: make DrawListViewHeader. s/DrawListView/DrawListViewItems.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: update to new ListView theme API and fix
	column header label rendering for 0 width columns.

2006-03-03  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (ControlCollection.SetChildIndex): Avoid using a call
	  that causes the control to be created. Fixes #77476.

2006-03-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Hwnd.cs: Clear the nc pending when clearing the NC area, not the
	expose_pending.

2006-03-02  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Implemented 2.0 feature where OnClick has MouseEventArgs
	  passed in for the EventArgs (fixes #77690)

2006-03-01  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs: Refresh afterbeing resized.

2006-02-28  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Call PerformPopup internal method to emit Popup.
	Clean up a tracker compile warning.
	* MenuItem.cs: add internal PerformPopup method.
	[Fixes #77457]

2006-02-28  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextBoxBase.cs (set_Text): Recalculate the document (causing an
	  implicit expose) when the text is set to null

2006-02-28  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs (FlushText): When newline is true, we always
	  need to split the line, even if no text is on it and we may
	  never eat newlines. (Fixes #77669)

2006-02-28  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: Add UpdateSelection internal method. Remove SelectItem 
	and set Selected instead.
	* ListViewItem.cs: Call owner.UpdateSelection to manipulate the 
	collections.

2006-02-28  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* ComboBox.cs: Allow setting SelectedIndex to -1. Fixes #77665

2006-02-28  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FontDialog.cs:
	  - Got rid of the panel. All controls are now directly added to
	    the dialog form
	  - It is now possible to set a font with the Font property
	  - MinSize and MaxSize property do now what they should
	  - ShowApply, ShowHelp, ShowColor, ShowEffects likewise
	  - Searching and selecting a font with the font textbox works now,
	    the same applies to the style and size textbox
	  - Draw the correct 3D border in the example panel
	  - Fixed a little mem leak (unused fonts didn't get disposed)
	  - Many other internal updates/rewrites...
	  - Fix typo

2006-02-27  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextControl.cs: 
	  - InsertRTFFromStream: Added 'number of characters inserted' argument
	  - set_SelectedRTF: Now using the number of characters to calculate
	    the new location for the selection and cursor (x/y cannot be used
	    due to potentially already wrapped text)

2006-02-27  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Added property and implemented means to allow 
	  disabling recalculation of a document (can be used to speed up
	  multiple inserts and is needed to make RTF inserts predictable, see
	  bug #77659)
	* RichTextBox.cs: Using the new NoRecalc property of Document to
	  keep x/y insert locations predictable. Also makes it faster inserting
	  large chunks of RTF

2006-02-27  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: Separated special WM_SYSKEYUP keyboard handling. That way
	  it's easier for a child control to handle the other messages without
	  having to duplicate the special functionality
	* TextBoxBase.cs
	  - WndProc: Removed calling base handler for WM_KEYDOWN and added 
	    code to handle processing the key ourselves, in order to get 
	    access to the result of KeyEventArgs.Handled. We now only call 
	    ProcessKey if they key hasn't been handled already. Fixes #77526.
	  - set_Text: If null or empty string is given, just clear the 
	    document. Fixes part of #77526

2006-02-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* SizeGrip.cs: Paint the background color before painting the grip
	so things look right.
	* MdiClient.cs: Add the sizegrip when both scrollbars are used.

2006-02-27  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs:
	  - Restructure layout and invalidation model to remove a ton of
	  flicker from the control and speed up performance in general.
	  - Add manual column resize, flickers like crazy, but I already have
	  some ideas on how I'll fix that. (#76822)
	  - Merge the three Icon-based views into a single layout method.
	  - Move item selection interaction logic from the item since 
	  interaction with the collections is more appropriate to the view.
	  - Deselection on non-item clicks.
	* ListViewItem.cs:
	  - Encapsulate most of the layout. Add some internal props to trigger
	  layout.  Move to a model where Items invalidate themselves instead
	  of just invalidating the whole control every time something changes.
	  - Invalidate on Text/Caption changes.
	  - switch to an offset based layout model to avoid having to absolute
	  position every element on item moves.
	  - correct checkbox layout to conform to MS layout.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	  - refactor some column header drawing code.
	  - fix string justification for column headers (#76821)
	  - make SmallIcon labels top justified for compat with MS impl.
	* ThemeClearlooks.cs:
	  - adjust to new ListViewItem internal checkbox bounds api.

2006-02-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs:  Change where implicit controls fall in the zorder.
	They are now on top of all children.
	- Synced AddImplicit code with Add
	- Removed unused enumerator.
	* SizeGrip.cs: Remove the TODO as its been TODONE.

2006-02-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextControl.cs(Insert): Combine the last lines unless the insertion
	  string ends with \n\n, otherwise we leave one line too many (Fixes
	  something I noticed with the testapp for #77526; the bug itself was
	  already fixed in the previous checkin)

2006-02-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs:
	  - SelectionColor and SelectionFont methods no longer set absolute
	    styles. Instead, the keep font or color respectively (This 
	    resolves a long-standing FIXME in the code)
	  - When flushing RTF text, the insert code now considers text trailing
	    behind the insertion point (Fixes the bug where when replacing
	    the selected text via SelectedRTF the remainder of the line behind 
	    the selection would stay on the first insertion line)
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - AppendText now updates the selection points after inserting text
	  - AppendText now ensures that the last tag (sometimes 0-length) of
	    the document is used for the style information (Fixes part of 
	    bug #77220)
	* TextControl.cs:
	  - Created new FontDefiniton class to allow describing partial style
	    changes
	  - StreamLine() now takes a lines argument, to allow it to decide
	    whether an encountered zero-length tag is the last in the document
	    (which must be kept to not loose the font/color contained in it,
	    for later appends)
	  - Created Combine() and Split() methods for Marker structs, to 
	    support marker updates due to reformatted documents (soft line
	    wraps)
	  - Implemented Document.CaretTag setter
	  - Fixed MoveCaret(CtrlEnd) handling, now moves to the last character
	    of the last line (Not the cause, but also exposed by bug #77220)
	  - Added LineTag argument to InsertString method, to allow callers
	    to force a certain tag to be used (required to force use of the
	    trailing zero-length tag of a document)
	  - Now updating markers in Combine(), to avoid stale tag markers
	  - Added some method descriptions to aid maintenance
	  - Implemented new FormatText concept, allowing additive/subtractive
	    formatting by only specifying the components that are to be 
	    changed. This was needed for resolving the RTB.SelectedColor/
	    RTB.SelectedFont fixmes
	  - Added Break() support method to allow breaking up linetags (used
	    for partial formatting)
	  - Added GenerateTextFormat() method. It is used for partial 
	    formatting and allows to generate a full font/color from given
	    attributes and an existing tag.

2006-02-26  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs:  Use the correct caption height.
	- Translate hittest coordinates to screen coords to match MS.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: When we create MDI windows we need to reset
	some of the style flags, so we get a nice blank window, and can
	draw all the decorations ourselves.
	- Set a clipping rectangle on the non client paint event, the
	window manager drawing code needs one.
	* Form.cs: The window manager needs to know when the window state
	has been updated.
	* Hwnd.cs: The window manager stuff now does a proper NCCALC so we
	don't need to factor in border and title sizes in these
	methods. TODO: Remove the args and fix the call points.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Handle NCHITTEST and NCCALCAREA
	properly.
	- Let the driver set the cursors.
	- Improve active window handling
	- Correct sizes for title bars and buttons.
	- Match MS drawing better
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: We don't need to handle border style
	updates specially anymore.
	- Check for scrollbars when windows are done moving
	- Handle Active properly.
	* MimeIcon.cs: Don't crash when we can't load the GNOME stuff
	correctly. I am spewing the exception though, so we don't hide the
	bugs.
	
2006-02-26  Pedro Martinez Julia  <pedromj@gmail.com>

	* DataGridViewRowPostPaintEventArgs.cs,
	  DataGridViewCellPaintingEventArgs.cs,
	  DataGridViewRowCollection.cs,
	  DataGridViewRowPrePaintEventArgs.cs,
	  DataGridViewCell.cs: Clear a few warnings and implement a few
	  exceptions that should be thrown.

2006-02-22  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs (ctor): Explicitly set a cursor to avoid
	  'inheriting' our parent's (non-default) cursor. (Part of
	   the fix for #77479)

2006-02-22  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Fixed cast to make csc happy

2006-02-22  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (WndProc): Only handle WM_SETCURSOR messages if
	  it's for the client area (part of fix for #77479 and needed
	  for MDI window cursor handling)
	* XplatUIX11.cs
	  - DefWindowProc: Now handles the WM_SETCURSOR messages, setting
	    the appropriate default cursors and also passing the message
	    up the parent chain 
	  - GetMessage: Now generating WM_NCHITTEST and WM_SETCURSOR even
	    for non-client areas

2006-02-15  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Since we fake MDI dont tell Windows that this
	is a real MDI window

2006-02-14  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* X11DesktopColors.cs: Instead of checking the desktop session
	  string for "KDE" check if it starts with "KDE"

2006-02-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: These should be unsigned (fixes crash on 32 bit
	systems).

2006-02-10  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Added Refresh to RunDialog to fix some drawing
	  errors
	* ColorDialog.cs:
	  - Got rid of the panel. All controls are now directly added to
	    the dialog form
	  - Changed to mono coding style

2006-02-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* InternalWindowManager.cs: We don't need the set visibility to
	false hack anymore now that peter has written beautiful shutdown
	code.

2006-02-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Ignore DestroyNotify messages for windows that
	  where already explicitly destroyed

2006-02-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Handle the case where windows are too high or to
	the left and we need scrollbars.

2006-02-10  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: Added some icons
	* FileDialog.cs:
	  - Fixed bug #77477
	  - Got rid of the panel. All controls are now directly added to
	    the dialog form
	  - Changed to mono coding style
	  - On Linux "My Computer" and "My Network" will now show some
	    more usefull information. A new class, MasterMount, gathers
	    this information from /proc/mount. Updated MWFFileView to make
	    use of this information
	  - Fixed a bug that caused FileDialog to crash when
	    ".recently_used" file had a zero size
	  - FilterIndex does now what it should
	  - Some Refactoring
	* OpenFileDialog.cs, SaveFileDialog.cs: Updated to reflect latest
	    FileDialog changes

2006-02-09  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Don't touch if null.

2006-02-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Cursor.cs: 64bit safeness fix
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Removed several unneeded and one moronic cast.

2006-02-09  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: If a form is made into an MDI form update the styles so
	all the props can get set correctly.
	- Kill the mdi_container when we dont need it anymore.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Add missing NOT

2006-02-08  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Respek clipping when drawing MDi
	decorations.

2006-02-08  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Hwnd.cs: Add bits to track non client expose events.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Track non client expose events on the hwnd. This
	gives us a proper invalid rect and will allow for some nice
	optimizations with NC client drawing
	- MDI windows are children windows, so move their style handling
	into the child window block.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Remove a state reset that was
	getting invoked at the wrong time. Fixes managed windows getting
	into a 'stuck' captured state.

2006-02-07  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs (Document.ctor): Now initializing 
	  selection_anchor. Fixes #77493

2006-02-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TrackBar.cs: The increment/decrements were backwards.

2006-02-07  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Theme*.cs : remove ThemeEngine.Current usage as it just points back
	to the instance itself.

2006-02-07  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* X11DesktopColors.cs, ThemeGtk.cs: The GObject structure is based
	  on ulongs and pointers, the size differs between 32bit and 64bit
	  systems. 

2006-02-07  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs : force the WorkingArea away from XGetWindowProperty
	for 64 bit platforms to work around a metacity bug. 

2006-02-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TrackBar.cs: Process the input keys we need, and hookup to
	KeyDown instead of using WndProc, so we get key messages.

2006-02-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Atoms are only 32bit on the wire, no matter what
	  machine we're on. 
	* X11Dnd.cs(SetAllowDrop): Since atoms are always 32bit on the wire
	  we need to translate the XdndVersion atoms array before sending it

2006-02-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: 
	  - The preceeding 64bit fixes had a bug: ChangeProperty expects the
	    number of bits for the property, not the number of bytes. The
	    change to provide IntPtr.Size broke 32bit. (64bit was also wrong
	    but would not crash since it specified 8 bits instead of 4 bits)
	  - More 64bit fixes: Switched all atoms from int to IntPtr (they are
	    defined as XID -> long in the C headers)
	  - Removed 'new IntPtr((int))' and '(IntPtr)' casts from all NetAtoms 
	    references since those are now IntPtr to begin with
	  - Switched all Atom.XXX 'int' casts to IntPtr casts
	  - Fixed XGrabPointer DllImport signature to work for 64bit (cursor arg)
	  - Fixed XInternAtom signature for 64bit, now returns an IntPtr
	  - Added XChangeActivePointerGrab DllImport (for X11DnD)
	* X11Structs.cs:
	  - Changed 'int' type for Atoms in XEvent structures to IntPtr
	  - Changed atom in HoverStruct to be IntPtr
	* X11DnD.cs:
	  - Removed local DllImports, switched code to use those from XplatUIX11
	  - Removed/fixed casts related to the switch of Atom to be a IntPtr

2006-02-06  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs : many more 64 bit pinvoke changes.  I've audited all the 
	method signatures in the import region.  There may still be some
	lingering struct marshaling issues, as I didn't drill down into those.
	Yet.

2006-02-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Dont manually set the top_item, this is computed
	when the scrollbar position is set.

2006-02-06  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs : 64 bit changes to XGetWindowProperty usage. Fixes
	startup crashes on amd64.  There's other fixes needed.  All pinvoke
	usage of Atom needs to be mapped to IntPtr for example.  And there are
	likely other int/long issues to be addressed.

2006-02-04  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: One more...

2006-02-03  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Next try

2006-02-03  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: First part of fix for #77464

2006-02-03  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ButtonBase.cs, ContainerControl.cs, Forms.cs,
	  ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Fix for #77458. Correct handling of
	  AcceptButton border drawing.

2006-02-03  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs: Moved positioning of form after auto scaling is applied,
	  otherwise it would possibly use wrong form size.

2006-02-03  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (RecreateHandle): No need to re-create any child
	  controls, the child windows will get destroyed automatically by
	  the windowing system or driver, and re-created when the handle
	  is being accessed the first time. Fixes #77456
	* Form.cs: No longer setting the form to closing if the handle is 
	  being recreated. This seems like the right thing to do, don't
	  have a bug or testcase for this, though.

2006-02-02  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Suspend/Resume layouting when changing sizes of
	  controls to avoid unwanted side effects

2006-02-02  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: 
	  - ScaleCore needs to scale the bounds, not the ClientSize of the 
	    control. Fixes #77416.
	  - DefaultSize is 0,0 for control
	* TextBoxBase.cs: 
	  - DefaultSize is 100, 20
	  - SetBoundsCore: Now enforcing the height, no matter if the provided
	    height is more or less than the preferred one, as long as AutoSize
	    is on
	* Form.cs: Apply documented fudge factor. Part of item 3 fix for #77416

2006-02-02  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs:
	  - ResumeLayout: Fixed logic when to call PerformLayout, we may not
	    call unless both performLayout is true *and* we have a pending
	    layout change
	  - ResumeLayout: MS does not completely nest Suspend and Resume,
	    they bottom out at 0, fixed our code to match that.
	  - UpdateBounds/SetBoundsCore: Moved calling of UpdateDistances() to
	    SetBoundsCore, we were updating even when we shouldn't. This fixes
	    swf-anchors mis-anchoring when resizing the app fast and lots.
	  - UpdateDistances: Now only setting the left and top distance if 
	    we have a parent and are not suspended, this is based on
	    a suggestion by Don Edvaldson in bug #77355.
	  - OnVisibleChanged: Fixed logic when to create the control. We may
	    not create the control if we have no parent or if it's not visible;
	    switched to using Visible property instead of is_visible field 
	    since the property also considers parent states. This fixes a bug
	    when starting Paint.Net

2006-02-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: If the forms handle hasn't been created yet don't call
	into xplatui to make it top most, just set the topmost flag on the
	form in CreateParams
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Handle WS_EX_TOPMOST.

2006-02-01  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ScrollableControl.cs: Refactored the Recalculate method a
	little, this wasn't handling all the variants of bottom and right
	bars needed to be added and added/removed based on their
	counterparts being added/removed (which changes the drawable
	size). Also we special case client widths and heights of 0 and
	don't add the scrollbar for those.

2006-02-01  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: 
	  - Added method to get AbsoluteGeometry(); currently unused, but might
	    be used in the future, if we try again to figure out toplevel
	    coordinates with some more crappy window managers
	  - Added FrameExtents() method to retrieve the WM set decoration size
	  - Tried to fix up AddConfigureNotify and handling of ReparentNotify 
	    to deal with at least KDE, FVWM and metacity (Fixes #77092)
	* Hwnd.cs: 
	  - Added whacky_wm tracking var for metacity
	  - Added logic to have default menu height if the actual menu height
	    has not yet been calculated (part of fix for #77426)
	* Form.cs: Keep track whether client size has been set and re-set 
	  it if a menu is added/removed afterwards (Fixes #77426)

2006-01-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: When a new Site is set on the component attempt to
	pull the AmbientProperties from it.

2006-01-31  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Menu background is drawn in ColorMenu, not
	  in the background of the owning form. Fixes #77332

2006-01-31  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: Fix for #77409

2006-01-31  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* XplatUIX11GTK.cs: Initial import

2006-01-31  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* FixedSizeTextBox: fixes class signature

2006-01-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* FixedSizeTextBox.cs: New internal class that represents a
	textBox that will not be scaled.
	* TreeView.cs:
	* ComboBox.cs:
	* UpDownBase.cs: Use the new FixedSizeTextBox instead of a
	standard TextBox.
		
2006-01-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Retrieve default screen number instead of
	  assuming 0. Attempted fix for #77318

2006-01-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: 
	  - GetWindowPos: When a window is parented by FosterParent, use 
	    the desktop instead of FosterParent as the base to get coordinates
	  - CreateWindow: Don't make FosterParent the parent window for Popups
	    if we don't want a taskbar entry, Popups automatically don't get one
	* Hwnd.cs: Need to call remove to actually remove the key from the
	  hash table

2006-01-30  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: adjust MainMenu item popup location to y=0.

2006-01-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs:
	* TreeNode.cs: Raise events no matter how the treenode is
	checked. Patch by Don Edvalson.

2006-01-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Signature fix.

2006-01-29  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs: Fixed a crash in ProgressBar drawing.

2006-01-20  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: Add ActiveTracker property to do Captures and perform mouse
	event forwarding when menus are active.
	* MenuAPI.cs: kill the GrabControl hack.  Use Form.ActiveTracker.
	Most of the patch is pdb's with a little rework.

2006-01-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs: 
	  Removed GetMenuDC and ReleaseMenuDC methods; replaced
	  by PaintEventStart(handle, false) and PaintEventEnd(handle, false)
	* Form.cs: Changed WM_NCPAINT handler to use PaintEventStart and End
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Added use of PaintEventStart/End to
	  handling of WM_NCPAINT message, now passing the PaintEventArgs to
	  the PaintWindowDecorations method
	* MainMenu.cs: Switched logic from GetMenuDC to PaintEventStart
	* MdiChildContext.cs: Switched logic from GetMenuDC to PaintEventStart
	* MenuAPI.cs: Made tracker window invisible
	* XplatUIWin32.cs:
	  - Removed GetMenuDC and ReleaseMenuDC methods
	  - Implemented the client=false path for PaintEventStart and
	    PaintEventEnd

2006-01-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs(SetBorderStyle): Fixed3D needs a border
	* XplatUIX11.cs(DeriveWindowStyles): Updated to match fixed Form
	  styles
	* Form.cs: 
	  - MaximizeBox, MinimizeBox: Recreate the handle when setting
	    the style
	  - CreateParams: Reworked the styles to match MS look'n'feel,
	    removed automatic setting of MinimizeBox, MaximizeBox, etc. via
	    the WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW style. This fixes #76823.

2006-01-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs(GetWindowState): Now throwing an exception when the 
	  window is not mapped, since otherwise every form that's being 
	  created is considered minimized, which is wrong.
	* Form.cs: Catching the exception and returning our internal value
	  instead

2006-01-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs: Added new driver method
	  SetWindowMinMax() to have means to tell the driver about the minimum,
	  maximum and maximized state window sizes. (Part of the fix for #76485)
	* Form.cs:
	  - Implemented tracking of minimum and maximum window size, now calling
	    new SetWindowMinMax() driver method to tell the driver (Part of the
	    fix for #76485)
	  - Finished handling of WM_GETMINMAXINFO method, now setting all values
	    (Completes fix for #76485)
	  - Calling new SetWindowMinMax driver method when the handle for a 
	    form is created, to make sure the driver knows about it even if
	    the values have been set before the window was created
	  - Now eating the WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED message if the form is minimized
	    to avoid messing up our anchoring calculations (partial fix
	    for #77355)
	* XplatUIStructs.cs: Added MINMAXINFO struct (moved from Win32 driver)
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Added _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN property for detecting minimized state
	  - Improved GetWindowState() to detect 'Minimized' state on Metacity 
	    (and presumably other freedesktop.org compliant WMs). Left the
	    assumption unmapped=minimized, needed for SetVisible to work.
	  - Now setting the window state when creating windows
	  - Fixed SetVisible to consider/set the window state when mapping
	    a Form. We cannot set the state before it's mapped, and we cannot
	    use Form.WindowState once it's mapped (since it would ask the
	    driver and get 'normal'. Therefore, we grab the state before
	    mapping, map, and then set state.
	  - Implmemented SetWindowMinMax method; Metacity does not seem to
	    honor the ZoomHints, though.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs:
	  - Removed MINMAXINFO (moved to XplatUIStructs)
	  - Added SetWindowMinMax stub (on Win32 the only way to set that
	    information is in response to the WM_GETMINMAXINFO message, which
	    is handled in Form.cs)
	  - Added logic to SetVisible to set the proper window state when a 
	    form is made visible (fixes #75720)

2006-01-26  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (BeginInvoke): Automagically handle EventHandlers the
	same way we handle them with Invoke.

2006-01-25  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs:
	  - Added tracking of window state so CreateParams can return
	    the appropriate style
	  - Moved setting of WS_CAPTION style in CreateParams to allow
	    styles without caption
	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs: We are now also creating the TextBox 
	  control if the TextBox property is accessed. Fixes #77345
	* Control.cs:
	  - get_Created: now uses is_disposed and is_created to determine
	    return value (suggested by Jackson)
	  - CreateHandle: No longer exits if the handle is being recreated
	  - RecreateHandle: If the handle is not yet created call the 
	    appropriate method to create either control or handle. If the
	    control is already created CreateHandle will simply exit instead
	    of just creating the handle
	* Hwnd.cs: Removed expose_pending tracking, no longer needed since we
	  now SendMessage WM_DESTROY directly to the control when DestroyWindow
	  is called.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: 
	  - When DestroyWindow is called, instead of waiting for the 
	    DestroyNotification from X11, we directly post it to the WndProc
	    and immediately dispose the hwnd object.
	    Same applies to DestroyChildWindows, and this obsoletes the
	    expose_pending tracking. Contrary to Win32 behaviour we destroy our
	    child windows before our own, to avoid X11 errors.
	  - Removed the direct sending of WM_PAINT on UpdateWindow
	* XplatUIWin32.cs:
	  - Reworked DoEvents and GetMessage to allow access to internal queue
	    even when trying non-blocking access to the queue.  Fixes #77335. 
	    Based on a patch suggestion by Don Edvalson. The new private
	    GetMessage can now also be used as a backend for a PeekMessage
	    frontend version.
	* XplatUI.cs: Improved debug output for CreateWindow

2006-01-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Help.cs: Allow param to be null. Patch by Don Edvalson.

2006-01-24  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Clamp the max value set for the vertical scrollbar
	when we have a MaxDropItems lower then the selected index.

2006-01-24  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Don't allow selection of non visible controls, allow
	selection of controls without parents.

2006-01-24  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Fixes Datagrid drawing issues
	* DataGridDrawingLogic.cs: Add editing row only when is necessary

2006-01-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* UpDownBase.cs: Make the textbox handle all the selection and
	tabbing. This fixes tabing to updown controls.

2006-01-24  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: fixes exception thown the object was null

2006-01-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ButtonBase.cs: Just use the base CreateParams. They set
	visibility and enabled correctly.
	* ComboBox.cs:
	* TrackBar.cs:
	* MonthCalendar.cs: Lets let the base set as much of the
	createparams as possible so we don't have duplicate code all over
	the place.

2006-01-22  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeGtk.cs: Added TrackBar and some experimental code to
	  get double buffering back

	* DataGrid.cs: Allows row number set internally higher than the last
	when creating a new row. Restores the editing functionality.

2006-01-20  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: delay Image creation until the icons are accessed
	instead of creating 190 scaled images on GnomeHandler startup.

2006-01-19  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextBoxBase.cs (WndProc): When handling WM_KEYDOWN we need to
	  first call base before processing the event. Fixes #77279

2006-01-19  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs, Cursor.cs: Fixed code that wrongly assumed
	  that the stride for the GDI bitmap would match the stride of
	  a DIB or a Cursor.

2006-01-19  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeGtk.cs: Added ProgressBar, RadioButton, CheckBox

2006-01-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Hookup the text controls keydown event so we get
	those when the text control has the focus.

2006-01-18  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Label.cs: Now using the base events instead of defining new ones;
	  this allows us to just call the base properties without having to
	  duplicate all base property logic 

2006-01-18  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Label.cs: A label by default is not a tabstop (Fixes one of our
	  failing nunit tests)

2006-01-18  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Fixed wrong DoEvents logic. Fixes #77282

2006-01-18  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Cursor.cs: Reimplemented creating cursor bitmaps without using
	  the Bitmap(Stream) constructor which is semi-broken on MS GDI+.
	  This fixes #77218
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: 
	  - Reimplemented creating Bitmaps from DIBs since the Bitmap(Stream) 
	    constructor creates images that can't be saved. Part of the fix
	    for #76103
	  - Added handling of CF_BITMAP as CF_DIB to clipboard code (Fixes #76103)
	  - SetWindowState: Switched ShowWindow flags (part of an upcoming 
	    bug fix for handling window state in forms properly)

2006-01-18  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeGtk.cs: Simplify ScrollBar drawing

2006-01-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	in the constructor.

2006-01-18  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeGtk.cs: First part of ThemeGtk enhancements.

2006-01-17  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* LinkLabel.cs: We need to update the hover drawing when
	  leaving the control as well.

2006-01-18  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: Clicking on non empty areas in the columns
	   area was giving an exception

2006-01-17  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	* ListView.cs: Do not draw/clip the headers when the header style
	is None.

2006-01-17  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: Fixes 77260
	
2006-01-17  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: Clicking on a column on a empty grid was giving
	  an exception

2006-01-17  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* DataGrid.cs (OnKeyDown): Don't use the array if it's empty
	  or any keypress will crash the grid.

2006-01-17  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MainMenu.cs (OnMenuChanged): set Height=0 to cause relayout.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs (CalcItemSize): clear Height/Width for 
	invisible/previously-visible items.
	[Fixes #76909]

2006-01-17  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs:
	- Added CL_Draw_Button method; now other theme controls that are 
	  not derived from button or do not have a button can draw buttons
	  too
	- Updated ComboBox drawing
	- Beautified RadioButton drawing
	- Corrected drawing of bottom and left tabs
	- Beautified DateTimePicker and MonthCalendar
	- Added CPDrawButton and CPDrawRadioButton

2006-01-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Set the initial value of the scrollbar to the
	current index. Reduce the numbers of refreshs and IndexOfs called.

2006-01-14  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: When the file listview is focused hitting the
	  backspace key moves the fileview to the parent directory

2006-01-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: 
	  - Added RecreateHandle call when changing taskbar visibility to 
	    trigger reparenting in Win32 driver (Fixes #75719)
	  - If a window has minimize or maximize buttons, it cannot have
	    a help button
	* XplatUIWin32.cs:
	  - CreateWindow: When no WS_EX_APPWINDOW style is found we parent
	    the toplevel form with FosterParent (A toolwindow not on the
	    taskbar) (Fixes #75719)
	  - Made FosterParent a toolwindow

2006-01-13  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Don't crash if InitialDirectory doesn't exist

2006-01-13  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ToolTip.cs: If SetToolTip is called from a control and the mouse
	  is currently over that control, make sure that tooltip_window.Text
	  gets updated

2006-01-13  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: size_t on lp64 fix for gdk_pixbuf_save_to_file extern.

2006-01-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: On MS GetNodeAt never actually factors in the X
	value passed.  Also redraw the selected node when we recieve
	focus, so tabbing between trees works correctly.

2006-01-13  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: GnomeHandler: older gnome versions don't have
	  ~/.gconf/%gconf-tree.xml, so use
	  .gconf/desktop/gnome/interface/%gconf.xml

2006-01-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextControl.cs: Draw text in gray if control is disabled

2006-01-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TreeView.cs: Draw the focus rectangle outside the highlight, to
	  make sure it's always visible. Fixes #76680.

2006-01-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Implemented Wheel scrolling. Fixes #76531

2006-01-13  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* PageSetupDialog.cs: Added.
	* PrintDialog.cs: Attributes.
	* PrintPreviewControl.cs: Updates.
	* PrintPreviewDialog.cs: Updates.
	
2006-01-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Undid my selection check fix, since it's not needed
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Now considering the presence of hscroll/vscroll when sizing
	    vscroll/hscroll respectively. Fixed bug #77077
	  - Added Left/Up/Down/Right to IsInputKey list to prevent
	    ContainerControl from stealing them. This fixes what I broke
	    with my last checkin.

2006-01-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* ScrollableControl.cs: Implemented dockpadding. Fixes #77166. And
	  I finally understand how the property can be set without a setter :-)

2006-01-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Application.cs:
	  - Switched RunLoop to use static Message.Create to create a 
	    Message object
	  - Added PreProcessMessage call in runloop for keyboard events; this
	    is part of the fix for #77219, I overlooked this originally in the
	    MSDN doc for PreProcessMessage
	* Control.cs:
	  - Removed call to PreProcessMessage from handling of keyboard 
	    messages; it's supposed to be done in the message pump
	  - Moved call to ProcessKeyEventArgs inside ProcessKeyMessage as
	    per MSDN documentation.
	  - IsInputChar: All chars are input chars by default; removed the 
	    parent calling chain, MS does not document that
	  - PreProcessMessage: If IsInputChar is true, we want to return false
	    to allow dispatching of the message
	  - When selecting the next control, now also check that we're not
	    selecting ourselves again and therefore return a false positive.
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Tried to match return values for IsInputKey and ProcessDialogKey
	    to what MS returns; moved processing of our special keys outside
	    ProcessDialogKey since MS does not seem to return true on those.
	  - Moved code that previously was in ProcessDialogKey into new private
	    ProcessKey method, which gets called upon receipt of WM_KEYDOWN
	  - Reworked handling of WM_CHAR to not have to duplicate code from
	    Control.cs anymore, instead we simply call down to base.
	   
2006-01-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: We always need to refresh the text area when
	EndUpdate is called. Fixes the combobox in the file dialog.
	* Control.cs: Don't create the creator_thread until the controls
	handle is created.  Also in InvokeRequired we check if the
	creator_thread is null. This gives the effect of InvokeRequired
	returning true if the controls handle is not created yet, and
	matches MS.

2006-01-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs:
	  - Added StartLoop() driver method. This is used to allow drivers to
	    prepare for an upcoming GetMessage/TranslateMessage/DispatchMessage
	    loop for a particular thread
	  - Added EndLoop() driver method. This is called once the message
	    pump for the thread is shut down
	  - Added SupportsTransparency method to allow the driver to indicate
	    opacity support for windows
	* Form.cs:
	  - Removed TODO attribute, completed AllowTransparency property
	  - Added documented logic to Opacity
	* GroupBox.cs, Label.cs, LinkLabel.cs, PropertyGrid.cs, Control.cs,
	  ButtonBase.cs, CheckedListBox.cs: Combined Jackson's and Miguel's
	  versions of CompatibleTextRendering
	* X11Structs.cs: Added opacity atom to our atom enumeration
	* Hwnd.cs: Added opacity tracking (we need to track since the opacity
	  of a form might be set before it's reparented by the WM, and we need
	  the opacity value without calling up to Form)
	* XplatUIDriver.cs: Added StartLoop(), EndLoop() and 
	  SupportsTransparency() driver methods
	* Application.cs: Now calling StartLoop and EndLoop driver methods
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Added opacity atom registration
	  - Added StartLoop()/EndLoop() methods. They're empty right now but
	    will need to get implemented when we switch to a per-thread queue
	  - Implemented SupportsTransparency() method
	  - Implemented SetWindowTransparency() method
	  - Added support for setting the opacity value when a window is
	    reparented (since the opacity needs to be set on the WM frame)
	* XplatUIOSX.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs:
	  - Added SupportsTransparency(), StartLoop() and EndLoop() methods

2006-01-12  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs: Don't crash if TabControl.Parent is null.

2006-01-12  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Added ToolTip for MWFFileView
	* MimeIcon.cs: Rewrote GnomeHandler.
	  - Get currently used gnome icon theme from
	    ($HOME)/.gconf/%gconf-tree.xml
	  - Make use of inherited icon themes
	  - Support SVG icon themes like Tango via librsvg

2006-01-12  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	Revert's Jackson's revert which broke 2.0 builds.   Fix both
	builds. 
	
	* Application.cs: Move the use_compatible_text_rendering outside
	the NET_2_0 define.  If we ever need to use the
	use_compatible_text_rendering on the individual controls they will
	access the variable from the common shared code paths.

2006-01-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs:
	  - Added more granular debug options
	  - Added method to print both window text and id
	  - Switched debug output to use new Window() debug method
	  - Added IsEnabled() driver method
	  - Added EnableWindow() driver method
	* Form.cs:
	  - Removed end_modal; no longer needed, new loop handles termination
	    via 'closing' variable
	  - If form is modal, setting DialogResult will now initiate loop
	    termination via 'closing' variable
	  - Added support for is_enabled/WS_DISABLED to CreateParams
	  - Close() now just send the WM_CLOSE message; the WM_CLOSE handler
	    does all the work
	  - Removed code that's now in RunLoop from ShowDialog()
	  - Added various documented sanity checks to ShowDialog()
	  - Added handling of WM_DESTROY message; we set 'closing' on getting
	    the message to indicate the message pump to terminate
	  - Added handling of new internal WM_CLOSE_INTERNAL message - it's
	    send by the Application.ExitThread method. (We send the message
	    to destroy the window after all other events have been
	    processed through the queue, instead of destroying the handle 
	    directly)
	  - Moved code from Close() method to WM_CLOSE handler; added logic
	    to only send close-related events if the form is not displayed
	    modal
	* Splitter.cs (..ctor): Fixed typo in resource name
	* Control.cs:
	  - DrawBackgroundImage: Explicitly selecting the wrap mode for the
	    brush now
	  - set_Cursor: Now only setting calling into XplatUI if the handle for
	    the control is already created; this avoids implict handle creation
	    or crashes if it's not created
	  - set_Enabled: Now setting the enabled state via the new driver method
	    instead of just tracking it
	  - CreateParams: Added logic to set WS_DISABLED based on enabled state
	  - CreateControl: Reordered event firing and method calls to more
	    closely fire events in the order MS does. Now setting the
	    enabled state in the driver when creating the control.
	  - SetVisibleCore: Moved when the OnVisibleChanged event is fired to
	    match MS order
	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs, MessageBox.cs, ButtonBase.cs, TrackBar.cs,
	  MonthCalendar.cs: get_CreateParams: Added setting of WS_DISABLED 
	* XplatUIStructs.cs: Added internal WM_CLOSE_INTERNAL mesage id
	* Hwnd.cs:
	  - Added tracking of window enabled state (get_Enabled/set_Enabled)
	  - Added EnabledHwnd property to easily allow a driver to find the
	    handle of the first enabled window in the parent chain (this is
	    used by drivers to pass up input events of disabled windows)
	* XplatUIDriver.cs: Added IsEnabled() method
	* Application.cs:
	  - Removed crude and obsolete exiting tracking variable
	  - Removed internal ModalRun(); replaced by RunLoop()
	  - Implemented private CloseForms() method to allow closing all 
	    windows owned by a particular (or all) threads
	  - Exit() now properly closes all windows without forcing the message
	    pump to quit
	  - Removed obsolete InternalExit() method
	  - Changed Run() methods to use new RunLoop() message pump
	  - Implemented new RunLoop() method for both modal and non-modal forms
	* CommonDialog.cs:
	  - get_CreateParams: Added setting of WS_DISABLED
	  - Simplified ShowDialog(); now all the work is done in RunLoop(),
	    invoked via Form.ShowDialog()
	* NativeWindow.cs: We don't remove the window from the collection when
	  the handle is destroyed; there might still be messages for it in the
	  queue (mainly the resulting WM_DESTROY); instead it will be removed
	  when Control calls InvalidateHandle in the WM_DESTROY handler
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - CreateWindow: Added logic to handle the WS_DISABLED window style
	  - EnableWindow: Implemented based on Hwnd.Enabled
	  - GetMessage: Reset PostQuitState so the method can be called again
	  - Implemented support for disabled windows (passing messages to the
	    first enabled parent) in handling all input messages
	  - Added optimizations for handling Expose events
	  - Implemeted new driver method IsEnabled()
	  - Now always resetting paint pending tracking vars when we start paint
	  - Re-implemented UpdateWindow via just sending a WM_PAINT message
	* XplatUIOSX.cs: Added IsEnabled method stub
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Implemented new IsEnabled() method

2006-01-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ButtonBase.cs, CheckedListBox.cs, GroupBox.cs, Label.cs,
	LinkLabel.cs, PropertyGrid.cs: Unbreak 1.1 build. Consolidate the
	variables a little.
	* ColorDialog.cs: Clear out the old form before adding the new
	panel.	

2006-01-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Make sure to add all the text formats when adding
	strings to the data object.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: When adding to a sorted tree we need to
	do some redrawing too.  Also change the UpdateNode to an
	UpdateBelow so the newly added node gets painted.
	
2006-01-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* ButtonBase.cs, CheckedListBox.cs, GroupBox.cs, Label.cs,
	LinkLabel.cs, PropertyGrid.cs: Implement the
	UseCompatibleTextRendering property for 2.x

	* Application.cs (SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault): Add. 

2006-01-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Use the property for setting the selected node so
	the correct events get raised.
	* TreeNode.cs: Update the tree when the fore/back colours of a
	node are set.

2006-01-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Allow setting SelectedNode to null.

2006-01-9  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* Form.cs: Fix support for Form TransparencyKey and Opacity on Windows.

2006-01-9  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* PrintControllerWithStatusDialog.cs: Update page number in dialog.

2006-01-9  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* PrintDialog.cs: Added attributes and set default property values.

2006-01-9  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* PrintControllerWithStatusDialog.cs: 
	Added PrintControllerWithStatusDialog.

2006-01-9  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* XplatUI.cs, Form.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs, 
	XplatUIWin32.cs: Added support for Form TransparencyKey and Opacity on Windows.

2006-01-9  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Fix crash when there is no selected item (due to last commit)

2006-01-09  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Added KeyDown event handler for processing arrow keys
	and PgUp/PgDown. Also, scroll to selected item upon dropdown. Bugs 76857 and 76788.

2006-01-08  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: Added internal class SVGUtil.

2006-01-08  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Don't crash if there are two files with the
	  same name but different locations.

2006-01-08  John BouAntoun  <jba-mono@optusnet.com.au>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: Fixed annoying rendering bug when selecting
	dates across multiple month grids. Used to not highlight entire 
	month, but does now.
	
2006-01-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: Removed DoEvents call to prevent a running
	message loop. Change timer intervals to numbers that seem more
	natural.

2006-01-06  John BouAntoun  <jba-mono@optusnet.com.au>

	* DateTimePicker.cs: Modified CalculateDropDownLocation to use the screen
	  object for location info since screen object is now implemented.

2006-01-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* AsyncMethodData.cs: Check if the call is complete before doing a WaitOne
	* AsyncMethodResult.cs: We no longer use a WeakReference for the
	AsyncMethodResult, this is because we ALWAYS want the
	ManualResetEvent to get set.
	* Control.cs: When disposing use an async invoke to call shutdown
	code, so that thigns don't block on the finalizer thread.  Also
	check if we even have a message loop before trying to send
	messages, if we don't then don't bother sending messages.
	- No more weak references for async methods
	* XplatUIDriver.cs: No more weak references for async methods.

2006-01-04  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FontDialog.cs: Fix, don't throw an exception if FontFamily.Families
	  returns two FontFamily with the same name

2006-01-04  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs, ThemeClearlooks.cs: Dropped stupid scheme of 
	  drawing disabled text. Instead using the ColorGrayText color

2006-01-04  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: redraw the node when its image index is changed.

2006-01-04  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: Same fix as last, just for SelectionColor. This
	  time I checked there are no others like it.

2006-01-04  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* AsyncMethodResult.cs: Use a ManualResetEvent instead of a mutex,
	this gives the behavoir I was looking for.
	* Control.cs: Special case Invoking EventHandlers, this matches MS
	and fixes part of bug #76326.

2006-01-04  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs, FileDialog.cs:
	  - Reflect the latest Theme class changes
	  - Remove Mono.Unix.Syscall.time in FileDialg and replace it 
	    with DateTime
	    
2006-01-04  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* Theme.cs: Cache UI resource images and resize them if needed

2006-01-03  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: FormatText is 1-based, make it so when SelectionFont
	  is called. This fixes the crash in Nexxia when setting the font
	  attributes in the chat. [However, RTF needs a look-over to make sure
	  that all SelectionXXX methods handle the special case that selection
	  is empty and therefore the change must be applied to all text starting
	  at the cursor/selection start]

2006-01-03  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs,
	  XplatUIOSX.cs: Added SendMessage and PostMessage methods
	* X11Keyboard.cs: Switched to new way of calling PostMessage

2006-01-03  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Theme.cs: Added theme interface for images to allow the theme to
	  control what images are used for things like FileDialog, MessageBox
	  icons, etc.
	* MessageBox.cs: Now uses the new Theme icon/image interfaces

2006-01-03  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs:
	  - Removed some dead code
	  - Opening a recently used file does work now
	  - Small UI enhancements
	  - Refactoring

2006-01-02  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Forgot too add __MonoCS__

2006-01-02  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: We are able to read recently used files now let's
	  go on and write them.

2006-01-01  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Breathe some life into "last open"/"recently used"
	  button
	* MimeIcon.cs: Do a check for the top level media type also

2005-12-31  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs:
	  - Added CPDrawStringDisabled
	  - ButtonBase_DrawText: Workaround for a DrawString bug; cut off
	    some chars if the text doesn't fit into text_rect
	  - DrawListViewItem: If View = View.LargeIcon center the image;
	    rewrote the drawing of ListViewItem.Text if View = 
	    View.LargeIcon

2005-12-31  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: Use default KDE icon theme if there is no
	  "48x48" directory for the current icon theme, fixes #77114
	* Mime.cs: Disable not working and actually not used code. 
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	  - Replace "new SolidBrush" in GetControlBackBrush and
	    GetControlForeBrush with ResPool.GetSolidBrush
	  - Changed DrawListViewItem from private to protected virtual
	* FileDialog.cs:
	  - Added form.MaximizeBox = true
	  - Don't throw an exception if there is a broken symbolic link

2005-12-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Give the panels focus, keyboard navigation is
	fixed so this works correctly now.
	- We need these key events also.
	* ToolBar.cs: Remove some of the poor mans double buffering.
	
2005-12-24  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: The internal TextBox now returns the focus.

2005-12-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:  Draw the text for all tab appearances.

2005-12-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Removed debug code
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Changed DestroyChildWindows to also consider
	  implicit children

2005-12-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: When creating the control, update the Z-order after
	  all it's children are created, too. (Fixes nexxia not showing
	  picturebox bug)

2005-12-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Do not update the anchoring distances if layout is
	  suspended, instead do it once layout is resumed

2005-12-22  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: 
	  - After many hours of debugging, for both Jackson and
	    myself, it turns out that it helps to set the parent of a control
	    if you want to actually see it onscreen. In the spirit of that
	    discovery, we're now setting the parent of the control and
	    it's children when the control's handle is created. This fix
	    will make Lutz Roeder's Reflector run happily. 
	  - now just creating the handle instead of the whole control when
	    getting a graphics context for the control.

2005-12-22  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ScrollableControl.cs: When calculating the canvas, don't consider
	  the scrollbar widths. Instead, predict if horizontal scrollbar
	  will affect canvas when deciding on vertical display and vice versa.

2005-12-22  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: Set default RTF font for documents that don't
	  have a font table (Fixes #77076)

2005-12-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: It's difficult to do, but you can have an empty
	clipboard. This prevents a NullRef in that case.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Use CLIPBOARD not PRIMARY for our
	clipboard. PRIMARY is for the currently selected text only. (We
	should implement PRIMARY at some point.

2005-12-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Fixed the TEXTMETRIC structure, we were calling
	  a Unicode function with a structure that was defined in Ansi way.
	  This fixes #76942.

2005-12-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* StatusBar.cs: Statusbar handles its fore/back colours on it's
	on. Because thats how it rolls. (and this avoids it using ambient
	colours).
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Use the proper back color for filling.
	* Menu.cs: Use the system menu bar color for drawing menu
	bars. Using the window back color will bring ambient colours into
	the picture.

2005-12-21  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ColorDialog.cs: Fixed a memory leak that caused a SIGSEV. A lot of
	  Bitmaps were created and not disposed.

2005-12-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (CreateControl): Don't do anything if the control is
	  already created, otherwise we'd fire the OnCreated event more than
	  once

2005-12-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* ComboBox.cs (FindStringCaseInsensitive): Don't search for emtpy strings,
	  will always match. Instead return -1. Fixes #76464.

2005-12-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs (RecalculateLine): Only wrap if the wrap point is
	  neither the beginning nor the end of the line (Fixes bug #76479)

2005-12-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs:
	  - ControlNativeWindow.ControlFromHandle(): Now handling situation
	    where handle is invalid
	  - FromHandle(): Now using hashtable-based ControlFromHandle() lookup
	    instead of slower linear search
	* NativeWindow.cs: Don't remove the window from the hashtable until
	  after the driver has destroyed it (since the driver might use
	  Control.FromHandle to lookup the control object
	* Hwnd.cs: Added DestroyPending property to track if a window is 
	  already destroyed as far as the driver is concerned and only hasn't
	  yet notified the control
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Activate(): Check if the window is still valid before using the 
	    handle
	  - Implemented DestroyChildWindow() method to mark child windows as
	    destroyed when a window is destroyed. This prevents situations 
	    where we might call an X method based on queued events for a
	    window that already has been destroyed but we haven't yet pulled
	    the destroy method from the queue.
	  - Added a call to the new DestroyChildWindow() method to the drivers
	    DestroyWindow code. Also now marking the destroyed window itself
	    as pending

2005-12-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* StatusBar.cs:
	* StatusBarPanel.cs: Don't calculate panel sizes on draw
	anymore. Just do them when needed, also track the rects of panels
	so that we can optimize refreshing more in the future.

2005-12-20  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ColorDialog.cs: Fixed focus drawing in small color controls

2005-12-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* InternalWindowManager.cs:
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Cleanup some coordinate system changes so
	moving windows works properly.

2005-12-19  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: 
	  - Removed call to InitLayout() from SetBoundsCore(); doc says
	    it's only called when a control is added to a container
	  - Split InitLayout logic, moved to separate UpdateDistances() method
	    since we need to perform those calculations more often than just
	    when adding the control to a container. (Needed to fix #77022)
	  - Now calling UpdateDistances() from UpdateBounds() (fixes #77022)
	  - Reduced the OnBindingContextChanged events count, don't send them
	    unless the control is created, we still aren't totally matching
	    MS, but I can't quite figure out some of their rules

2005-12-18  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs: Corrected distance between ProgressBar
	  stripes

2005-12-18  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs:
	  - Updated ProgressBar drawing
	  - Corrected drawing of ScrollBars and scroll buttons
	  - Some temporary fixes for minor pixel artefacts

2005-12-18  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs:
	  - Reworked Controls.Add(), Controls.Remove() and set_Parent() to
	    cause events to be sent in the same order as MS does.
	  - Added ChangeParent() method to trigger various OnXXXChanged events
	    that need to be fired when a parent changes (This is a reworking
	    of the patch from r54254, with the X11 errors fixed)
	  - Removed SuspendLayout()/ResumeLayout() calls from Controls.Clear()
	    since on MS we get OnLayoutChanged events when calling Clear()
	  - Changed Enabled property to consider parent state as well, if a
	    parent is not enabled, the control will not be either
	  - Changed Parent property to simply call Controls.Add() since that
	    now does all the work required, this way we avoid code duplication
	  - Threw in a few OnBindingsContextChanged calls to try and match
	    when MS sends them. We seem to send a few too many, though.
	  - Added call to CreateControl when adding the control to a parent.
	    We were never calling CreateControl. Still needs some work, in
	    some places we treat HandleCreated and ControlCreated as equal, 
	    which is wrong
	  - Removed obsolete commented out code from UpdateZOrder()

2005-12-18  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs: Updated TrackBar drawing.

2005-12-17  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Patch for #76901 by Atsushi Enomoto

2005-12-17  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Add the Help button and the open readonly
	  checkbox only if needed

2005-12-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Make sure we have an active menu before trying to
	process commands on it. Prevents menu-less forms from crashing
	when Alt is pressed.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Some fixes to prevent null refs. Patch by
	Dieter Bremes.
	* RichTextBox.cs: Expand statement to help out gmcs and fix the
	2.0 build.

2005-12-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Don't translate tool windows screen
	coordinates. This fixes windows 'bouncing' around when being moved.

2005-12-15  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - MaxLength now treats 2^31-1 equal to unlimited length (this is
	    not quite MS compatible, MS uses that number only for single line
	    and 2^32-1 for multi-line, but I figure it won't hurt keeping
	    the limit at 2GB)
	  - Now enforcing the MaxLength limit when entering characters
	  - Added argument to internal Paste() method to track if it's called
	    from programatically or via keyboard, since keyboard driven pastes
	    need to enforce max-length
	  - Added logic to Paste to only paste as many chars as MaxLength 
	    allows
	* RichTextBox.cs: Updated to use new obey argument for internal Paste()
	* TextControl.cs:
	  - Added Length property to return number of characters in document
	  - Added private CharCount property which only tracks actual chars
	    in the document (no linefeeds) and fires event when CharCount
	    changes
	  - Added tracking of character count to all methods that alter it
	  - Added LengthChanged event to allow applications to subscribe
	    to any changes to the document

2005-12-15  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextBox.cs: 
	  - Removed local password_char field (moved to TextBoxBase)
	  - Now setting the document's password var when password is
	    set
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Added password_char field (needed here so MultiLine can
	    access it)
	  - Added logic to MultiLine property setter to set the document's
	    variable when password display is allowed
	  - Removed debug code and made some debug code conditional
	* TextControl.cs:
	  - Added RecalculatePasswordLine() method to handle special password
	    char only lines
	  - Added PasswordChar property, also added related tracking vars
	  - Draw() method now uses local text var for grabbing text to draw,
	    this var is set to line.text unless we're doing password display,
	    then it is set to the pre-generated all-password-chars line
	  - Added calling RecalculatePasswordLine() method for password lines

2005-12-14  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Hwnd.cs: 
	  - Added Reparented property to allow tracking of Window Manager
	    reparenting actions (which affect X/Y calculations of toplevel 
	    windows)
	  - Made ToString() print window handles in hex
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - AddConfigureNotify(): Now uses reparented state off Hwnd to
	    determine if X/Y needs offsetting
	  - AddConfigureNotify(): Fixed offset calculations
	  - Now adds ReparentNotify messages into the queue
	  - Now processes ReparentNotify messages and causes a 
	    WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED message to be sent upstream if a window
	    is reparented (as most likely it's X/Y coordinates are changed
	    due to that)

2005-12-14  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Tool windows still need to respek focus.

2005-12-14  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: Undid 54254 (causing XConfigure errors) so we can
	  have a working release

2005-12-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: Update styles after setting the border style regardless
	of whether or not the window is using a window manager.

2005-12-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: We now hook into an internal window manager instead of just an
	MDI subsystem, this is so we can have properly behaving tool windows.
	* MdiClient.cs: Naming change, MdiChildContext is now WindowManager
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: New internal class that acts as a
	window manager for tool windows and as a base for mdi windows.
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: New class that acts as a window manager for
	mdi windows.

2005-12-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Updates so we match behavoir for for implicit
	controls. Fixes explosions in MDI.

2005-12-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Implement Invalidate (Region).

2005-12-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: 
	  - Changed handling of Controls.Add/Controls.Remove to fire (almost) 
	    the same events as MS does. MS fires events for each property 
	    except, for unknown reasons, Cursor, when the control is reparented. 
	    I can't seem to totally match add/remove since MS also fires some 
	    VisibleChanged events, which makes no sense. Consolidated the
	    parenting code into a separate method so it can be called from
	    both Add and Remove. set_Parent no longer needs any special logic
	    as it calls the parent's add method which implicitly fires
	    all events
	  - Removed some obsolete code and debug output
	  - Enabled state is inherited from parents, if this is enabled

2005-12-08  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs: Removed commented out code

2005-12-08  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs:
	  - Added internal version of Invoke, with additional argument 
	    indicating if we're calling it from a Dispose() handler. That
	    way we can avoid BeginInvoke throwing an exception if we're
	    calling for an already destroyed window.
	  - Added a dispose argument to BeginInvokeInternal, and made the
	    check if a valid window handle chain exists conditional on
	    it not being a dispose call
	  - Removed code in DestroyHandle to destroy our children. Since we
	    now handle the WM_DESTROY message we will catch all our children
	    being destroyed.
	  - Now calling OnHandleDestroyed from our new WM_DESTROY handler
	* Form.cs:
	  - Added a field to track the application context of the form.
	  - No need to set closing variable as response to WM_CLOSE, instead
	    we destroy the window. We also call PostQuitMessage if the form
	    has an application context (which makes it the main app form,
	    which, when closed terminates the app)
	* XplatUI.cs:
	  - Dropped Exit() method, it's naming was confusing
	  - Added PostQuitMessage() which causes GetMessage to return false
	    once the message queue is empty
	* XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs: Dropped Exit(), added 
	  PostQuitMessage()
	* XplatUIOSX.cs: Switched signature for Exit method since Exit() is
	  no longer a valid XplatUI method, but left it in since it's used
	  internally. Added empty PostQuitMessage() method.
	* MenuAPI.cs: Replaced call to Exit() with call to
	  PostQuitMessage, even though this is probably no longer needed.
	* Hwnd.cs: Added 'pretty' ToString() to support debugging.
	* X11Structs.cs: Added pretty XEvent.ToString() to support debugging.
	* Application.cs:
	  - Replaced call to XplatUI.Exit() with PostQuitMessage()
	  - Removed old debug code that would call XplatUI for exception
	    display, enabled standard exception handling (Still not enabled
	    though, until NativeWindow's ExternalExceptionHandler define
	    is removed
	* NativeWindow.cs:
	  - Added internal method to allow control to update NativeWindow
	    after a window has been destroyed
	  - Added handling of already destroyed windows when calling i
	    DestroyWindow
	  - Added removal of handle from list on ReleaseHandle
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Dropped GetMessageResult var and related code
	  - Added PostQuitState to field to track if PostQuitMessage has been
	    called
	  - Dropped Exit() method
	  - Added PostQuitMessage() method
	  - GetMessage now will return false if PostQuitState is set and no
	    more messages are in the queue.
	  - Expose handler will no longer generate WM_PAINT messages if we are
	    in PostQuitState since it's very likely any windows have already
	    been destroyed, and since Hwnd won't get updated until we have
	    processed the DestroyNotify we'd be causing X errors.
	
2005-12-07  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs(WndProc): Apparently I'm suffering from brain cloud.
	  Thanks to Mike for pointing out the err of my ways.

2005-12-07  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs(PreProcessMessage): Moved menu handling back, but
	  after all other key handling, to match MS (who handles Menu in
	  DefWndProc)
	* Menu.cs (WndProc): Removed my brainfart

2005-12-07  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs(PreProcessMessage): Removed special menu handling 
	* Menu.cs (WndProc): Added handling of WM_SYSKEYUP for menu purposes.

2005-12-07  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Control.cs : special case SYSKEYUP so that we can adjust keynav
	state according in tracker.
	* Menu.cs : promote tracker field to base class and provide a tracker
	lookup capability.  Add/Remove shortcuts dynamically if the top menu
	has a tracker. Unparent items that are removed from the collection.
	* MenuAPI.cs : implement mnemonic, shortcut, and arrow-based keynav.
	* Theme*.cs: add always_show_hotkeys field to support configurability
	of mnemonic display.  win32 doesn't show mnemonics until Alt is
	pressed.

2005-12-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiChildContext.cs: Use Control.ResetCursor.
	* Control.cs: ResetCursor needs to set the property so that the
	correct XplatUI call gets made.

2005-12-07  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: More fixes to make our key events match MS. We
	  were not setting the modifier state on KeyData, and we were
	  not generating any events when Alt was pressed with a key
	  since handling of WM_SYSxxx was missing for the OnKey methods.

2005-12-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiChildContext.cs: reenable the sizing code.
	- When the mouse leaves a window reset its cursor.

2005-12-07  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs: Reflect latest Hwnd changes

2005-12-07  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Hwnd.cs: Now using the theme 3d bordersize to calculate
	  widths of Fixed3D borders

2005-12-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Fix warnings. Earn Mike's love.

2005-12-07  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs:
	  - Adjusted mouse over button color
	  - Added first parts of CheckBox drawing
	  - Added correct color for selected text background
	  - Fixed ComboBox drawing
	  - Added CPDrawBorder3D and CPDrawBorder

2005-12-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Added call to XBell for AudibleAlert

2005-12-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs,
	  XplatUIOSX.cs: Added AudibleAlert() method to have a means to
	  alert users via sound. We could add an enum arg with different
	  types of alerts in the future

2005-12-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Fix behaviour problems pointed out by Mike

2005-12-05  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* StatusBarPanel.cs: add Invalidate method and hook it into all the
	prop setters.  Calls parent.Refresh for now, but could be maybe be
	optimized with an internal method on StatusBar at some point.
	[Fixes #76513]

2005-12-05  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* RichTextBox.cs: Implemented get_SelectionColor

2005-12-05  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs:
	  - Removed dead code
	  - Draw black button border only if button is Form.AcceptButton
	  - Draw correct button color for pressed RadioButton if the mouse 
	    has entered the button
	  - Updated ProgressBar drawing!
	  - Updated CPDrawSizeGrip drawing
	  - Updated StatusBarPanel drawing

2005-12-05  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (PreProcessMessage): add Keys.Alt based on LParam value.
	* X11Keyboard.cs (SendKeyboardInput): formal lParam for alt mod.

2005-12-04  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs: Initial check-in, activate with
	  export MONO_THEME=clearlooks
	* ThemeEngine.cs: Added ThemeClearlooks

2005-12-03  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: deactivate menus prior to calling item.PerformClick.
	[Fixes #76897]

2005-12-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: If the child form has no menu the default main menu is
	used as the active menu.

2005-12-02  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* ListBox.cs: Check if any items exist before trying to resolve 
	  coordinates into items

2005-12-02  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Hatchbrush on Win32 seems to always use white
	  as the second color for the background hatch

2005-12-02  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Now uses Jackson's new and improved ImplicitScrollbar
	* RichTextBox.cs: FormatText position arguments are 1-based, now making
	  sure that what we pass to FormatText is always 1-based. Fixes #76885

2005-11-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* NumericUpDown.cs (EndInit): When we are done initializing,
	reflect any updates on the UI.

2005-12-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ImplicitHScrollBar.cs:
	* ImplicitVScrollBar.cs: New scrollbars that don't take focus from
	their container controls.
	* TreeView.cs: Use the new implicit scrollbars.

2005-12-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Make top_node internal so the TreeNodeCollections
	can play with it.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: If we remove the topnode we need to
	update topnode to the next node in line.
	- When clearing nodes go through the same process as removing
	them, so they get depareneted and checked if they are top node.

2005-12-01  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: When imagelists are used the image area is
	selectable as well as the text.
	- If there are no selected nodes select the first one.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Getting the TreeView is mildly expensive,
	so don't do it more then we need to.

2005-12-01  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Reimplement the scroll arrow drawing so
	that arrows can be scaled.

2005-12-01  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNode.cs : Fixed bugs that caused FullPathTest + Traverse to
	fail. Patch by Dieter Bremes

2005-11-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: Property is 2.0 only
	* PrintDialog.cs: Signature fix.

2005-11-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs: 
	  - No longer artificially moves text 2 pixels down (now that we have
	    borders this is no longer needed)
	  - Added calcs for left, hanging and right indent

2005-11-23  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Menu.cs: mark MenuChanged internal, since it's not exposed by MS.

2005-11-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiChildContext.cs: Set the cloned menus forms, as these don't
	get cloned as part of CloneMenu ().
	* Menu.cs: Make sure the parent of the items get set correctly
	when they are added.  And the owners are notified of the changes.
	* Form.cs: Create an ActiveMenu property, so that when MDI is used
	we can change the menu being displayed/handled by the form without
	changing the menu assosciated with the form.
	- Don't let Mdi children draw/handle menus.
	
2005-11-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Menu.cs: Switch the MenuChanged method to OnMenuChanged and add
	a MenuChanged event. Just to make the API a little more
	consistent.
	* MainMenu.cs:
	* MenuItem.cs: Use the new OnMenuChanged
	* MdiChildContext.cs: Handle menu merging.
	* Form.cs: Implement MergedMenu.
	
2005-11-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Menu.cs: We were misusing Add. Add goes behind the specified
	index according to the docs, and does not replace the specified
	index. So I added an Insert method.

2005-11-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs:  Implemented Ctrl-Ins (Copy), Shift-Ins (Paste) and
	  Shift-Del (Cut), apparently Emacs uses these old Win 2.x keys. This
	  is for Jackson
	* RichTextBox.cs: Added calls to base for DnD events

2005-11-28  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs:
	  - Fixed drag-selection related crash; style fixes
	  - Implemented undo class
	    o Implemented method to capture document state for specified
	      range in document tree
	    o Implemented method to restore captured document state
	    o Implemented cursor tracking
	    o Implemented basic undo stack
	  - Added undo cursor tracking to methods altering cursor location
	  - Added undo tracking to selection deletion (still missing
	    other text-altering hookups)
	* RichTextBox.cs:
	  - Added SelectionLength property
	  - Implemented CanPaste()
	  - Implemented Paste()
	  - Added missing protected methods
	  - Fixed RTF->Document conversion; now uses font index 0 and color 
	    index 0 as the default font for the parsed text
	  - Fixed RTF<->Document font size translation
	  - Fixed RTF generation, now properly handles cross-tag boundaries
	    for single line selection
	  - No longer always appends blank line to generated RTF
	  - Removed TODOs
	  - Added missing attributes
	  - Hooked up undo-related methods
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Implemented Copy()
	  - Implemented Paste()
	  - Implemented Cut()
	  - Fixed caret mis-behaviour on backspace across line-boundaries

2005-11-29  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Add a method for activating mdi children. Very
	basic right now. I imagine someday it might need more girth.
	* MenuItem.cs: Implement MDI lists. When mdilist is true the mdi
	children windows names are added to the menu item.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Draw the arrow if the item is an
	mdilist. This happens regardless of whether or not there are any
	mdi windows to see in the list, and according to my tests happens
	before the items are even added. Also happens if there isn't even
	an mdi client to get windows from.

2005-11-29  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Make DrawFlatStyleRadioButton protected
	* ThemeNice.cs: Fix drawing of flatstyle radiobuttons

2005-11-29  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* DataGridTableStyle.cs:
	  - Create always the styles for the missing columns even if they are
	    provided by the user (not default table style)
	* DataGrid.cs:
	  - Fixes bug 76770
	  - Fixes SetDataBinding (always re-attach source)
	  - Fixes SetNewDataSource (only clear styles if they are not for 
	    this source)
	 -  Expands OnTableStylesCollectionChanged to handle style refresh 
	    and remove properly

2005-11-29  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Implement missing bits, remove some dead
	code.
	* FontDialog.cs: Implement missing Apply stuff, and ToString. Move
	creation of the panel so that the options set on the dialog are
	seen when the panel is created.
	* TreeView.cs: raise a click when items are clicked.
	
2005-11-29  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Pass some signature methods through to base.

2005-11-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ListView.cs: Raise the click event when items are clicked.

2005-11-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Make this algorithm even more beautiful.  And fix
	a nullref.

2005-11-27  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeNice.cs: - Removed 1 pixel bitmaps
	  - Use SmoothingMode.AntiAlias where it makes sense
	    (ScrollButton arrow for example)
	  - Enhanced Button focus drawing
	  - Fixed ComboBox drawing (no artefacts anymore, focus
	    rectangle is back again, reduced size of ComboButton, etc.)
	  - Fixed RadioButton focus drawing for Appearence.Button
	  - Slight ScrollButton redesign
	  - Some LinearGradientBrush size fixes
	  - GroupBoxes have now rounded edges
	  - Fixed StatusBar drawing

2005-11-25  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeNice.cs: - Remove dead code
	  - use correct background colors for menus, etc.
	  - Fake pixel drawing with 1 pixel bitmaps

2005-11-24  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Size the scrollbars when resizing the window.
	- Resize the maximized windows when the client is resized
	* Form.cs: Make the child context available
	
2005-11-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiChildContext.cs: Don't size windows if they are maximized.

2005-11-23  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ContextMenu.cs: use MenuTracker.
	* Control.cs: remove menu handle usage.
	* Form.cs: remove menu handle usage.
	* Hwnd.cs: remove menu handle usage.
	* MainMenu.cs: Draw method moved here from MenuAPI.DrawMenuBar. Proxy
	motion and clicks to the new Tracker handlers.
	* Menu.cs: add sizing accessors, SelectedItem prop, kill CreateItems
	and handle usage.
	* MenuAPI.cs: refactored to combine popup and menubar event handling.
	Killed the MENU and MENUITEM data types and associated collections
	since we now keep the info on Menu and MenuItem. Expanded TRACKER into
	MenuTracker class that exposes the leftovers from the old MenuAPI
	static methods. Restructured Capture handling so that only one grab is
	done for the entire menu hierarchy instead of handing off grabs to
	submenus. Tracker now has an invisible control to Capture when active.
	* MenuItem.cs: add sizing accessors, kill Create
	and handle usage.
	* Theme.cs: remove menu handle and MENU(ITEM) usage.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: use Menu/MenuItem sizing props instead of
	MENU(ITEM). remove menu handle usage, use Menu directly.
	* XplatUIDriver.cs: remove menu handle usage.
	* XplatUIOSX.cs: remove menu handle usage.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: remove menu handle usage.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: remove menu handle usage.

2005-11-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Hwnd.cs: Don't compute the menu size for
	DefaultClientRectangle.
	- Reenable menu sizes being computed for GetClienRectangle.
	* Form.cs: Remove comment of trechery
	
2005-11-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Hwnd.cs: The adjustments for the menu bar are made when it is
	attached to the form.

2005-11-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Create an HGRN of the invalid area for WM_NCPAINT
	(just like on windows).

2005-11-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiChildContext.cs: Handle all the buttons ourselves. We can't
	use real buttons anymore because they are in non client area. The
	one TODO here is that I need to somehow invalidate a section of
	the non client area.

2005-11-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Put the enum check back in now that MDI doesnt have
	to use this to set border styles.
	* Form.cs: Only set mdi child windows borders if the handle has
	been created.
	* MdiChildContext.cs: Don't set the InternalBorderStyle, just pass
	this directly on to the driver.
	- Get the move start position before adjusting for the titlebar
	height, this fixes the windows "skipping" when they are first
	moved.

2005-11-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Just compute the mdi borders separately as they
	don't totally match up with normal form borders.

2005-11-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Set WS_ styles for borders, so that the driver does
	not have to retrieve the control instance to figure out what kind
	of borders it should have.
	* Form.cs: Set the WS_EX_MDICHILD flag on mdi children, so the
	driver can know its an mdi child easily.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Get the border styles and whether the window is
	MDI from the Styles and ExStyles params instead of having to get a
	control. This prevents a chicken and egg problem.	

2005-11-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Fix typo so scrollbars show up correctly.

2005-11-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Calculate when to add and remove scrollbars
	correctly.
	* MdiChildContext.cs: Adjust the y position to take the titlebar
	into account.
	- No height for FormBorderStyle.None

2005-11-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Allow non enum values to be used for
	InternalBorderStyle.  MDI does this to set a special border style.
	- New utility methods for converting points to/from client coords
	- Add the newly created control to the Controls collection before
	updating its style. This way UpdateStyle can walk the control
	heirarchy to find the control if needed.
	so I don't need to create a new Point object all the time.
	* Form.cs: Let MDI windows handle their border styles.
	- Set styles on MDI windows so the correct title style is derived.
	* MdiChildContext.cs: Move all the painting and window handling
	into the non client area.
	- Use correct sizing and put correct buttons on frames based on
	the FormBorderStyle.
	- Notify the mdi client about scrolling
	- Need to handle the buttons ourselves now, because they are all
	in non client areas and we can't add controls there.
	* MdiClient.cs: Halfway to scrolling, this implementation is
	somewhat broken though, we need to check to make sure other
	windows aren't causing scrolling before removing the bars. Also
	the bars need to be drawn on top, maybe I can switch implicit
	controls to be on top.
	* Hwnd.cs: caption_height and tool_caption_height are now
	properties of an hwnd, this way they can be set by the driver
	based on the type of window they are.  In X11 the window manager
	handles the decorations so caption_height is zero unless its an
	MDI window.
	- Add 3 pixel borders for MDI windows (0xFFFF).
	- Get rid of some code duplication, have DefaultClientRectanle
	just call GetClientRectangle.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Pass caption_height and tool_caption_height to
	Hwnd now.
	- Set border styles differently for mdi windows.
	* XplatUIOSX.cs: Pass caption_height and tool_caption_height to
	Hwnd now.
	
2005-11-15  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Menu.cs: when adding an item to the collection, if item is already 
	parented, remove it from the parent.

2005-11-13  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* X11DesktopColors.cs: Added KDE support

2005-11-11  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: 
	  - Clipboard methods now can translate Rtf format
	  - No longer removes clipboard contents whenever a new format is added
	    to allow placing multiple formats on the clipboard
	* Clipboard.cs: Clipboard now supports getting a IDataObject and
	  will place all formats contained in it onto the clipboard. Also
	  now cleans the clipboard before placing a new object onto it
	* RichTextBox.cs:
	  - Implemented set_Rtf
	  - Implemented set_SelectedRtf
	  - Created InsertRTFFromStream() method to allow single code base
	    for all properties and methods that insert RTF into document
	  - Removed debug output
	* TextControl.cs:
	  - Fixed Delete(int) to fix up line numbers
	  - Fixed ReplaceSelection to combine start and end line
	  - Fixed serious DeleteChars bug that would leave the document tree
	    broken
	  - Improved DumpTree with several logic checks to detect broken
	    document trees
	  - Removed debug lines
	  - Fixed Caret.WordForward/WordBack moving code, now always also 
	    updates caret.tag (fixes crash when word-selecting across tag
	    boundaries via keyboard)
	  - Added Insert() method for inserting multiline text into documents
	  - Fixed DeleteChars() calculation errors that would cause a broken
	    tag chain with multiple tag lines
	  - DeleteChars() no longer crashes on multi-tag lines if not all tags
	  - Split() no longer moves caret if split is at caret location
	  - ReplaceSelection() now updates the cursor and re-displays it
	  - ReplaceSelection() now uses new Insert() method to avoid code
	    duplication
	  - FormatText() can now handle formatting partial lines
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Append now uses new TextControl.Insert() method (this avoids 
	    duplicate code)
	  - Implemented Ctrl-X (Cut) (
	  - Implemented Ctrl-C (Copy)
	  - Implemented Ctrl-V (Paste) (Still some bugs related to screen 
	    regeneration when pasting text; roundtripping Copy&Paste within
	    edit control still fails due to some calculation bugs in GenerateRTF)
	  - The Delete key will now remove the current selection if it is visible
	* TextBox.cs: Removed debug lines
	* XplatUI.cs: Trigger initialization of DataFormats (which requires the
	  driver to be initialized and can't therefore be done via a static ctor)

2005-11-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Added backend code for finding char arrays and strings
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Added mouse wheel scroll support
	  - Added support for VScroll and HScroll events
	* RichTextBox.cs:
	  - Implemented all seven Find() variants
	  - Implemented GetCharFromPosition()
	  - Implemented GetCharIndexFromPosition()
	  - Implemented GetLineFromIndex()
	  - Implemented GetPositionFromCharIndex();
	  - Implemented SaveFile for PlainText and UnicodeText
	  - Fixed set_Font, now setting a new font applies that font to
	    the whole document
	  - Implemented generic Document to RTF converter
	  - Implemented SaveFile for RichText format (still missing unicode
	    conversion for non-ansi chars)
	  - Implemented get_Rtf
	  - Implemented get_SelectedRtf

2005-11-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (WndProc): Call HandleClick after having sent OnMouseUp
	  to allow any captures to be released before triggering OnClick. This
	  way a click handler may capture the mouse without interference.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Always send mouse messages to grab window if one exists.
	  This way we send them even though X may not allow a grab (if the window
	  isn't visible, for example)

2005-11-08  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: 
	  - Draw the outside focus rectangle around buttons
	  - Use CPDrawFocusRectangle to draw focus rectangles until Cairo
	    doesn't use end caps for every dash of a line anymore. This
	    workaround ignores the forecolor.

2005-11-08  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Don't use ArgbColor with LayoutKind.Explicit as it isn't
	  endian safe.

2005-11-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Set the X/Y positions on the DragEventArgs correctly.

2005-11-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ScrollableControl.cs: Calculate the maximum and change vars
	(more) correctly so that scrollbars appear as a sensible size.

2005-11-04  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Refresh when nodes are cleared from the
	collection.
	* TreeView.cs: When the tree is sorted null out the top_node so
	that it is recalculated.
	- Use dotted lines instead of dashed lines to match MS better.

2005-11-04  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: 
	  - Implements key search for items. Useful when browsing files with FileDialog
	  - When changing view mode or when clear the items reset scrollbar positions

2005-11-04  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* CurrencyManager.cs: Implement the MetaDataChanged event, the
	Reset method, and the CheckEmpty. CheckEmpty is just a total guess
	as to what the method may do as there is no real way of creating a
	derived CurrencyManager and calling the method. 

2005-11-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Implement ownerdrawing in the tab control
	* TabControl.cs: Add Ownerdrawing bits, add the UpdateTabSelection
	method which seems to just be used internally to refresh the tabs.

2005-11-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Implement the remove method. Fix some broken
	comments.

2005-11-03  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

2005-11-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNodeConverter.cs: Implement to get off my class-status back.

2005-11-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Hookup the bits for drag and drop.
	* TreeNode.cs: Don't cache the tree_view or index anymore, now
	that nodes can be moved from tree to tree easily this just causes
	all sorts of problems.
	* TreeNodeCollection: Don't need to give treenodes an index and
	treeview anymore when they are added, these are computed on the
	fly. Also make sure to remove a node before its added.

2005-11-03  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs:
	  - Added CaretSelection enum
	  - Added comparison methods to Marker struct, makes selection code
	    more readable
	  - Added SelectionStart and SelectionEnd as 'moveable' location for
	    the CaretDirection enum and handler
	  - Added selection_prev variable to track optimized invalidation for
	    word and line selection
	  - Added SelectionVisible property (returns true if there is a valid 
	    selection)
	  - Switched CaretHasFocus to only display the caret if there is no
	    visible selection
	  - Avoiding StringBuilder.ToString to retrieve a single char, instead
	    using the direct character index; should be much faster
	  - Added various conditional debug statements
	  - Fixed invalidation calculation for selection ranges
	  - Added ExpandSelection() method to support word and line selection
	  - Switched SetSelectionToCaret to use new Marker compare overloads
	  - Added central IsWordSeparator() method to determine word 
	    separators/whitespace and FindWordSeparator() to streamline common
	    usage of IsWordSeparator()
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Removed unneeded grabbed variable, it was just mirroring
	    Control.Capture
	  - No longer firing OnTextChanged event when Text setter is called,
	    since the base will fire the event for us
	  - Added handling of Ctrl-Up/Down selection
	  - Added handling of Shift-Cursorkey selection
	  - Added handling for Ctrl-Delete and Ctrl-Backspace to remove
	    words
	  - Added handling of Shift and Ctrl-Shift-Home/End selection
	  - Removed some debug output
	  - Added handling for single/double/tripple-click to place caret/
	    select word/select line respectively (Fixes bug #76031)
	  - Added support for drag expansion of word/line selection
	* RichTextBox.cs: Handle GotFocus event to trigger redrawing of
	  current selection

2005-11-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: If the drag is going to and from a MWF window just
	copy the data instead of sending it out through the X Selection
	mechanism.

2005-11-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs:
	* XplatUIX11.cs: When in a drag we don't want motion notify
	messages to get passed on to the other controls. This prevents
	mouse move messages from showing up in the drag source.

2005-11-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Remove unneeded call to XAllowEvents.  Make sure that
	the correct button is release to end a drag.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Make the button state internal so the drag system
	can access it.  Dragging needs to know about all button releases,
	not just left button.

2005-11-02  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Form.cs (Icon): If the icon is null, reset the icon to the
	default value. 

	* Cursor.cs: When writing the AND-mask bitmap do not include the
	number of colors, but hardcode those to two (black and white),
	fixes the loading of color cursors (Paint Dot Net).

	* Form.cs: To debug, allow MONO_MWF_SCALING=disable variable to
	turn off autoscaling.

	* Cursor.cs: Allow resource type to be 1 or 2 (from ImageMagic).

2005-11-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Make sure to send a status message if the pointer
	enters a control that can not accept a drop, otherwise the cursor
	isn't updated correctly. Also tried to compress the lines of code
	a bit.

2005-11-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Change cursors based on drag action. Also attempt to
	set actions correctly.  This isn't perfect as XDND and win32 have
	some differences on how you allow actions. I'll clear this up by
	adding a path for drag from MWF to MWF windows.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Hook into the dnd system.

2005-11-02  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jmas@softcatala.org>

	* ListView.cs: Fixes scroll bar visibility. Hide them if they were
	previously shown but they are no longer need it. Very obvious when 
	browsing files with FileDialog.

2005-11-01  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: We always need to call OnPaintBackground. We pretty much
	  ignore AllPaintingInWmPaint and always do the painting there, whether 
	  it's set or not, since we always ignore the WM_ERASEBKGND message 
	  (which we don't generate on X11). This fixes #76616.
	* Panel.cs: Removed unneeded background painting. This happens properly
	  in Control.cs already

2005-10-31  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Menu.cs: Add items to collection before setting their index.
	* MenuItem.cs : add range checking with ArgumentException like MS.
	[Fixes #76510]

2005-10-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Invalidate if the area is visible at all not just
	contained in the visible rect. Fixes unselection of semi visible
	items.

2005-10-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Consistently name the dnd methods. Make them
	internal so we can override them to match some MS behavoir
	internally.
	* Win32DnD.cs: Use the new consistent names.

2005-10-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Don't draw the selected node when we lose focus.

2005-10-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: We still need to reset the state even though a full
	reset isn't being done, otherwise status's still get sent all over
	the place.

2005-10-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Make the dnd_aware flag internal so the dnd
	subsystem can check it. Catch exceptions thrown in dnd handlers to
	match MS behavoir.
	* Hwnd.cs: Add a flag for whether or not a window is dnd aware.
	* X11Dnd.cs: Handle null data in the converters. Set the XDND
	version when sending a XdndEnter. Use the control/hwnd dnd_aware
	flags to reduce the number of dnd enters/status's sent.

2005-10-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Don't need the sizeof here. Patch by Jordi Mas.

2005-10-31  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* PictureBox.cs: Fixes 76512

2005-10-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Early implementation to support winforms being a drag
	source for data on X11. Also restructured the converters so they
	can go both ways now.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Tie ins to the the Dnd stuff.
	
2005-10-27  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Fixed FIXME - implemented ASCII encoding for XA_STRING
	  clipboard requests

2005-10-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Implement serialization so my DnD examples will work.

2005-10-24  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ButtonBase.cs, ListView.cs, NotifyIcon.cs, PictureBox.cs, ToolBar.cs,
	  TreeView.cs: Don't dispose objects that are not owned.
	  
2005-10-24  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Cursor.cs: Defaulting the Current cursor to Cursors.Default. We
	  should retrieve the current cursor and report that, but XplatUI
	  doesn't (yet) have an interface for that (and I'm not sure I even
	  can, on X11)
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Fixed override behaviour. The override is temporary,
	  until any message loop processing is done (and the WM_SETCURSOR
	  replaces the cursor to the proper one)
	* XplatUIX11.cs: 
	  - Fixed override behaviour, we can't set the cursor globally on X11, 
	    just for our windows.
	  - Invalidating the System.Drawing X11 display handle when we are
	    shutting down
	* Control.cs: Fix to make csc happy

2005-10-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: 
	  - get_Text: Add last line (without trailing newline) to returned
	    value (Fixes 76212)
	  - get_TextLength: Count last line in returned length
	  - ToString: Call Text property instead of duplicating code

2005-10-23  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Dispose ImageAttributes objects.

2005-10-22  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Use attribute constructors with less arguments where
	  possible.

2005-10-22  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Added lastKeyIndex field and use in IndexOfKey.
	  Use typeof instead of strings when assembly is referenced. Added
	  some more comments.

2005-10-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ListView.cs: Raise a double click event. Also tried to somewhat
	fix when the selectedindexchanged event is raised. Its still
	broken though.

2005-10-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: New method to invalidate the plus minus area of a
	node without invalidating the whole node (maybe this can be used
	in some more places).
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: When adding to an empty node we need to
	invalidate its plus minus area so the little block shows up.
	
2005-10-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Make sure that when we invalidate a node the bounds
	are big enough to cover the selected box and the focus
	rectangle. Use a different colour for the lines connecting nodes
	so they show up with all themes.

2005-10-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* NativeWindow.cs: Don't call anything that could call into the driver,
	  we might be on a different thread.

2005-10-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs(Dispose): Since Dispose might run on a different thread,
	  make sure that we call methods that could call into the driver via
	  invoke, to avoid thread issues

2005-10-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs: Removed finalizer
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Removed Destructor, was causing crashes due to X11
	  not allowing to be called on the finalizer thread.

2005-10-21  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs:
	  - Reverted r51889 and r51891.
	  - Added ImageListItem class that stores unmodified image items and image
	    properties required to create list images until handle is created.
	  - Added AddItem and moved image creation logic to AddItemInternal.
	  - Added CreateHandle method that creates images based on unmodified items.
	  - Added DestroyHandle that changes state to store unmodified items.
	  - Add and AddStrip methods no more create handle.
	  - ReduceColorDepth has no return value.
	  - Dispose destroys handle.
	  - Modified other methods to reflect the above changes.
	  - Implemented key support.
	  - Added profile 2.0 members and attributes.
	  - Added private Reset and ShouldSerialize methods that provide the same
	    behavior as MS.NET but the Visual Studio .NET designer seems to ignore
	    them as they are private.
	  - Added some more comments about implementation details.

2005-10-21  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: Adds support for vertical scrolling using the mousewheel

2005-10-21  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* Binding.cs: No PushData/PullData if there is no binding (fixes crash)

2005-10-21  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* DataGridDrawingLogic.cs: Fixes column hit calcultation
	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs: Remove debug message

2005-10-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: We can always get input keys regardless of whether
	or not editing is enabled. They are used for navigation.

2005-10-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Use the viewport rect for determining if a node
	needs to be moved for visibility. Don't use Begin/End edit. This
	calls a full refresh when its done.
	* TreeView.cs: New SetBottom works correctly.  Make the viewport
	rect property internal so the treenodes can see it. When clicking
	on a node we need to ensure that its visible because it might just
	be partly visible when clicked.

2005-10-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Remove debug code.

2005-10-20  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* Datagrid.cs: Implements column sorting in Datagrid
	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs: Implements column sorting in Datagrid

2005-10-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Remove items properly. Update the correct
	area after removing them.

2005-10-20  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* Datagrid.cs: Should not call base.OnPaintBackground

2005-10-20  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (GetMessage):
	  - Now properly calculates NC_xBUTTONDOWN coordinates off the whole
	    window instead of client window
	  - Now properly calculates NC_xBUTTONUP message coordinates
	  - ScreenToMenu now properly calculates it's coordinates of whole 
	    window, since menus are in the whole window, not in the client
	    window
	  - Added WholeToScreen coordinate translation method

2005-10-20  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs (GetMessage): Don't return in situations where we don't
	  want to return a message, loop back to the beginning of the function
	  and grab the next real message to process instead.

2005-10-20  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Splitter.cs: Properly set limits if no filler control is used

2005-10-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ColorDialog.cs: Don't show the help button if it is not enabled
	instead of disabling it	(this is what MS does). Don't create the
	panel until the dialog is run, otherwise the vars (such as
	ShowHelp) are not set yet.

2005-10-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Implement Begin/EndEdit more correctly so refreshes
	are reduced when adding nodes.
	* TreeNode.cs:
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Use UpdateNode instead of refreshing the
	tree.
	
2005-10-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs: End editing our treeview so the window
	actually gets refreshed.

2005-10-18  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Fixed logic flip on when to call OnPaintBackground. 
	  Obsoleted handling of WM_ERASEBKGND, now always draws our background
	  inside of WM_PAINT

2005-10-18  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Returns after Hidding window
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Added TODO found while debugging menu issues

2005-10-18  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Do not re-map the whole window when it's size
	  becomes non-zero unless it's supposed to be actually visible

2005-10-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: We don't need to keep a count anymore.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Fix off by one in RemoveAt, Insert can
	use the Grow method.

2005-10-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Insert is not supported on arrays, so
	implement it manually here.

2005-10-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Dont kill the list when the colour depth is
	changed, just change the colour depth of all the images.
	- Same goes for setting the image size. Just resize them all
	instead of killing the list softly.

2005-10-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Don't invalidate empty rectangles.

2005-10-18  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs:
	  - Adds checked item to the Checked/Item lists (where empty before)
 	  - Do not add items to the Selected lists if they are already present
	* ListView.cs:
 	  - Fixes IsFixedSize, SyncRoot, IsReadOnly in many collections
	  - When deleting items make sure that we delete them for the Selected
	  and Checked list also.

2005-10-18  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* Label.cs: Dispose objects no longer used
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Dispose objects no longer used

2005-10-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Don't refresh the whole control when the tabs are
	scrolled, we just need to refresh the tab area.

2005-10-17  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Compress code a little bit. Only calculate the
	after handle when we need it.

2005-10-17  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: When the parent size changes, recalculate anchor 
	  positions. Partial fix for #76462

2005-10-17  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Make sure the picturebox has it's background 
	  drawn. Fixes #76462

2005-10-17  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: Don't create the numeric up down until our
	handle is created. Otherwise our handle is created in the
	constructor and we don't know if we are a WS_CHILD or WS_POPUP
	yet.

2005-10-17  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Merge in patch by Rafael Teixeira to align strings
	correctly.

2005-10-17  Rafael Teixeira <rafaelteixeirabr@hotmail.com> 
	* TreeNode.cs : small logical fix (was using local var instead of field)
	
2005-10-17  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Fixes vert/horz scrollbar colours

2005-10-17  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Fixes focus drawing in for non-flat/popup buttons

2005-10-16  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: 
	  - Re-implemented anchoring code. My first version was really broken.
	    This fixes bug #76033. Unlike the previous implementation we will
	    no longer have round errors since all numbers are calculated from
	    scratch every time. Removed various anchor-related obsolete vars.
	  - InitLayout no longer causes layout event firing and layout to be 
	    performed

2005-10-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Hwnd.cs: Compute invalid area correctly (fixes my last commit
	which was broken).

2005-10-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Remove debug code.

2005-10-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XEventQueue.cs: Increase the default queue size (very simple
	apps needed to grow the queue).
	* Hwnd.cs: No finalizer so we don't need to suppress
	finalization. Compute the invalid area manually so a new rectangle
	does not newto be created.
	* ScrollableControl.cs: Don't set any params (otherwise visibility
	isn't set correctly).
	* MdiChildContext.cs: New constructor takes the mdi parent so it
	doesn't have to be computed and avoids a crash on windows. Draw
	the window icon properly, and allow the text to be seen.
	* Form.cs: Use new MdiChildContext constructor. Make sure the
	child context isn't null in wndproc.
	* TabControl.cs: Don't set focus, this is muddling keyboard
	behavoir. Expand the tab rows when a window size increase will
	allow extra tabs to be seen. Don't allow tabs smaller than the
	width of a window to be scrolled out of view.
	* TreeNode.cs:
	* TreeView.cs: Use measure string to calculate a nodes width, the
	width is cached and only updated when the text or the font is
	changed. Don't check for expand/collapse clicks on the first level
	nodes if root lines are disabled.
	
2005-10-16  Ritvik Mayank  <mritvik@novell.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Fixes #76352 (passing tab key in a multiline textbox)

2005-10-16  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* DataGridBoolColumn.cs: fixes warning

2005-10-16  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* ControlPaint.cs: Fixes methods Dark, DarkDark, Light, LightLight
	to match more to match more precisely the MS Net behavior

2005-10-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Hwnd.cs: Added field to track if window is mapped
	* XplatUIX11.cs: 
	  - Unmap windows if they become 0-size, re-map when 
	    they are >0 again; fixes #76035
	  - Re-set our error handler after initializing X11Desktop
	    to override any error handlers Gtk or whatever was called
	    may have set.

2005-10-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* CheckedListBox.cs: Removed unused vars
	* ListView.cs: Fixed signatures
	* RichTextBox.cs: Removed unused vars
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Removed unused vars
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Removed unused vars
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Removed unused vars
	* XplatUI.cs: Updated version and date to latest published

2005-10-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Cursor.cs: Added private .ctor to work around a bug in
	  resourceset (Thanks to Geoff Norton for the help on this)
	* SplitterEventArgs.cs: Made fields accessible so we don't
	  waste boatloads of objects and can reuse the same one
	  in Splitter
	* XplatUIWin32.cs(DrawReversibleLine): Now also considers
	  any captions and borders when generating screen coordinates
	* Splitter.cs: Reimplemented control, now fully complete, uses
	  rubberband drawing, supports and obeys all properties, has
	  proper cursors

2005-10-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Form.cs (Form): Setup default values for autoscale and
	autoscale_base_size;  Make these instance variables, not static
	variables. 

	(OnLoad): on the first load, adjust the size of the form.

2005-10-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs: Added 
	  width argument to DrawReversibleRectangle()
	* XplatUIWin32.cs, XplatUIX11.cs: 
	  - Implemented width for DrawReversibleRectangle()
	  - Added logic to DrawReversibleRectangle that recognizes a zero
	    width or height and only draws a line in that situation
	
2005-10-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs: Added GetAutoScaleSize()
	* XplatUIOSX.cs: Stubbed GetAutoScaleSize() method
	* XplatUIWin32.cs, XplatUIX11.cs: Implemented GetAutoScaleSize()
	  method (it uses our FosterParent window to get a graphics context)

2005-10-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs: Removed EraseWindowBackground 
	  and SetWindowBackground methods
	* Control.cs:
	  - Setting proper ControlStyles
	  - We no longer call XplatUI.SetWindowBackground and XplatUI.
	    EraseWindowBackground, instead we draw the window background
	    ourselves in PaintControlBackground. This behaviour is
	    required to match MS, where, when OnPaintBackground is not
	    called, the background is not drawn.
	  - Removed unneeded Refresh() in set_Text
	* Hwnd.cs: Dropped the ErasePending support. No longer needed
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Created DeriveStyles method to translate from CreateParams to
	    FormBorderStyle and TitleStyle, also handles BorderStyle (which
	    matches FormBorderStyle enum values)
	  - Consolidated SetHwndStyles and CalculateWindowRect border/title
	    style calculations into single DeriveStyles method
	  - Fixed CreateWindow to (finally) use Gravity. This prevents X11
	    from redrawing the whole window on any resize or expose.
	  - Fixed CreateWindow usage of SetWindowValuemask. Before not
	    all styles were applied to our whole/client window appropriately
	  - Removed EraseWindowBackground() and SetWindowBackground() methods
	  - Removed handling of WM_ERASEBKGND message from DefWndProc, we
	    no longer clear/redraw the background through X
	  - Removed handling of erase_pending bit, we have no use for it (or
	    so it seems)
	* XplatUIOSX.cs:
	  - Removed generation and handling of WM_ERASEBKGND message
	  - Removed EraseWindowBackground() and SetWindowBackground() methods
	  - Removed handling of hwnd.ErasePending flag
	* XplatUIWin32.cs:
	  - Removed EraseWindowBackground() and SetWindowBackground() methods
	  - We no longer call EraseWindowBackground on PaintEventStart, we 
	    ignore the fErase flag, erasing is handled in Control in the
	    background handler

	  - Removed obsolete edge style
	  - Switched from BorderStyle to FormBorderStyle
	
2005-10-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: Use the property to get the window handle instead of
	accessing it directly. Prevents a null reference exception.

2005-10-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Don't adjust the rect given to DrawString now that
	our libgdiplus draws correctly.

2005-10-08  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Don't try to find the clicked on node if there are
	no nodes in the tree.

	* ImageListStreamer.cs, TreeView.cs, UpDownBase.cs, RichTextBox.cs,
	  ColorDialog.cs, TextControl.cs, Panel.cs, MdiChildContext.cs,
	  ErrorProvider.cs:
	  Use ResPool for brushes and dispose System.Drawing objects that
	  are not used anymore.

2005-10-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiChildContext.cs: Use the new borders instead of drawing them
	ourselves.

2005-10-06  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* Calling UpdateBounds after changing the window's BorderStyle 
	since the style can change the ClientSize

2005-10-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Made PaintControlBackground virtual
	* Panel.cs: Overriding PaintControlBackground instead of using paint
	  event; paint event method was interfering with 'real' users of the
	  event.

2005-10-06  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: remove border drawing since it is handled
	by the base control class now and was causing double border drawing.

2005-10-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Panel.cs: Redraw our background on paint. Not a pretty solution,
	  but it does seem to match MS behaviour. This fixes bug #75324

2005-10-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: A better DrawReversibleRectangle version, however
	  somewhat hackish looking

2005-10-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - We now accept Enter even if AcceptEnter is false, if the containing
	    form does not have an AcceptButton configured (fixes bug #76355)
	  - Calculations are now fixed to no longer use Width/Height, but
	    ClientSize.Width/Height, since we now support borders (this was
	    a result of fixing borders and therefore bug #76166)
	  - We no longer show the horizontal scrollbar if TextBox.WordWrap is 
	    true (fixes bug #76354)
	
2005-10-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	    is created
	  - Added enum check to InternalBorderStyle setter

	  - Fixed the signature for SetWindowLong

	  ListBox.cs, Label.cs: Now uses Control.InternalBorderStyle for 
	  setting borders
	* UpDownBase.cs: Remove drawing of borders, this is handled by
	  the driver, outside the client area
	* ListView.cs: Removed bogus border calculations. The control should
	  be oblivious to borders, since those are not part of the client
	  area. 
	* X11DesktopColors.cs: Commented out (currently) unneeded variables
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Removed border calculations from ListView 
	  drawing code

2005-10-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	  - Added loading and setting of our new default icon
	  - Only set icon if window is already created

2005-10-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Label.cs:
	  - Do not explicitly set the foreground and background colors, to
	    allow inheriting from parents (fixes #76302)
	  - Use Control's InternalBorderStyle property to deal with borders

2005-10-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiChildContext.cs: Use the new xplatui function to draw a
	reversible rect.

2005-10-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: Add the parent before creating the child context cause
	we need the parent when setting up the child.

2005-10-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs: redo the tree population code so a
	second thread isn't used. Should be a lot faster and more stable
	now.

2005-10-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: There are no expand/collapse boxes if the node has
	no children.

2005-10-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

2005-10-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: If updating the root node do a full refresh.
	* TreeNode.cs: The root node should be expanded by default. Also
	added a utility prop to tell if we are the root node.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Only refresh if the node we are being
	added to is expanded. Also added a comment on a potential
	optimization.
	
2005-10-04  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Cursor.cs, Hwnd.cs: Added call to GC.SuppressFinalize()

	  Create handle. NET_2_0: Destroy handle when value is null.

2005-10-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs: My last scrollbar patch was broken. This is a
	revert and a new patch to prevent the thumb from refreshing so
	much.

2005-10-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs: Don't update position if it hasn't actually
	changed. This occurs when you hold down the increment/decrement
	buttons and the thumb gets to the max/min.

2005-10-01  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs:
	* MdiChildContext.cs:

2005-09-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* X11DesktopColors.cs: Initial incomplete implementation
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Added call to initialize X11DesktopColors

2005-09-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Theme.cs: 
	  - Switched Theme color names to match the names defined in 
	    System.Drawing.KnownColors. Life's hard enough, no need to make 
	    it harder.
	  - Added setters to all theme color properties so themes can set
	    their color schemes. The setters also propagate the color changes
	    to System.Drawing.KnownColors via reflection
	* ControlPaint.cs,  Label.cs, TextControl.cs, ToolTip.cs, ThemeNice.cs,
	  ComboBox.cs, MdiChildContext.cs, TextBoxBase.cs, DateTimePicker.cs
	  DataGridColumnStyle.cs, MonthCalendar.cs, TreeView.cs: Updated to
	  use the new, more logical theme color names
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Updated the GetSysColorIndex enum to include new
	  post-NT colors
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	  - Removed code to set the old classic Windows colors. Instead it
	    now relies on the colors returned by System.Drawing.KnownColors
	    which will be either modern static colors (Unix) or colors
	    read from the user's configuration (Win32)
	  - Updated to use the new, more logical theme color names
	  - Switched DataGrid drawing code to use only Theme colors instead of
	    a mix of System.Drawing.KnownColors and Theme colors
	  - DrawFrameControl(): Removed code that fills the button area, the
	    fill would overwrite any previous fill done by a control. This
	    fixes bug #75338 
	  - Added DrawReversibleRectangle() stub
	* ScrollableControl.cs: Set visible state to false when scrollbars
	  are removed (pdn fix)
	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs: Added 
	  DrawReversibleRectangle() method to allow drawing primitive 
	  'rubber bands'
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Implemented DrawReversibleRectangle()

	  source has to be the ImageList.

2005-09-30  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Add(Icon): Use Graphics.DrawIcon instead of Icon.ToBitmap.

2005-09-30  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* GridItemCollection.cs: Added ICollection interface

2005-09-30  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

		- Fixes drawing
		
2005-09-29  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@gmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs (ImageStream) [NET_2_0]: Reflect re-factoring.

2005-09-29  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Added comments about handle creation. Moved Handle,
	  HandleCreated and OnRecreateHandle implementations to ImageCollection.
	  Handle is created in Add methods.

2005-09-28  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>
	 
	* DataGridDrawingLogic.cs: 
		- Takes rows into account on Colum calculations
		- Returns the column when clickig
	* DataGrid.cs:
		- Fixes default HitTestInfo values
		- Fixes HitTestInfo.ToString
		- Fixes ResetBackColor		
	
2005-09-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiChildContext.cs: Obey rules for fixed sized windows (no
	sizing or cursor changes). Also added some temp code to draw the
	titlebars text (Makes dev a little easier).

2005-09-28  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs: AddStrip: Throw ArgumentException when Image is not a Bitmap.

2005-09-28  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>
	 
	* ListBox.cs: Fixes bug 76253

2005-09-28  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Added comments about the current implementation. Added
	  ReduceColorDepth, IndexedColorDepths and GetNearestColor to can use
	  Format32bppArgb to preserve transparency and can use Graphics.FromImage
	  while using the specified ColorDepth. ReduceColorDepth uses unsafe code
	  with Bitmap.LockBits for better performance. Revised the whole file to
	  match MS.NET behaviour and provide better performance. Non-public
	  interface members are calling public members even when they throw
	  NotSupportedException for better maintainability. Moved ColorDepth,
	  ImageSize, ImageStream and TransparentColor implementations to
	  ImageCollection for better performance as these properties are not used
	  by ImageList.
	* ImageListStreamer.cs: Added a new internal constructor that takes an
	  ImageList.ImageCollection and serializes Images based on
	  ImageCollection.ToArray(). Renamed ImageColorDepth to ColorDepth to
	  match ImageList property name.

2005-09-28  Kazuki Oikawa <kazuki@panicode.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Fixes IndexFromPoint for last item

2005-09-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: Set the position of new mdi children correctly.

2005-09-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: New mdi children need to be added to the back of
	the controls collection so the zorder is set correctly. Also add a
	count of all the child windows that have been created.

2005-09-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs (CreateParams): Setup MDI forms correctly.

2005-09-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiChildContext.cs:
	* MonthCalendar.cs:
	* UpDownBase.cs:
	* ListBox.cs:
	* ListView.cs:
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	* TreeView.cs:
	* ScrollableControl.cs:
	* ComboBox.cs: Add implicit controls using the new implict control
	functionality in ControlCollection. Also try to block multiple
	control add in a suspend/resume layout to save some cycles.
	
2005-09-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Add functionality to the controls collection to add
	'implicit controls' these are controls that are created by the
	containing control but should not be exposed to the user. Such as
	scrollbars in the treeview.
	* Form.cs: The list var of the ControlsCollection is no longer
	available because of the potential of implicit controls getting
	ignored by someone accessing the list directly.

2005-09-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Fixed SetChildIndex; it no longer causes a child to
	  loose it's parent. (Fixed bug introduced in r49103 when we added
	  setting the child parent to null on Remove)

2005-09-26  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* DataGridBoolColumn.cs: Marked CheckState private to fix public API.
	* Splitter.cs: Added missing attributes for BorderStyle property.
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Marked Calculate* methods internal.
	* TextBox.cs: Fixed DefaultValue for PasswordChar property to match
	MS.NET.

2005-09-26  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>
	 
	* ListBox.cs: Fixes navigation to the last item in multicolumn lists

2005-09-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Update the node bounds correctly regardless of
	whether the node is visible.

2005-09-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Don't dispose the image after it is added to the
	image list. Only reformat images that need to be resized.

2005-09-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Don't set the format when changing the image.

2005-09-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	treeviews font if no node font is available.

2005-09-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Allow the scrollbars to be reset with negative
	values.
	- Don't add scrollbars to negative sized windows.

2005-09-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Update to use Mono.Posix.Native instead of plain
	old Mono.Posix. Also remove some stray code that shouldn't have
	been committed.

2005-09-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Attempt at proper sizing of the horizontal
	scrollbar. Also don't resize the scrollbars unless they are
	visible.

2005-09-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: We don't need to expand the invalid area when the
	selection changes, as this is all drawn in the node's bounding
	box. The area needs to be expanded (previous typo was contracting
	it) when the focus rect moves.

2005-09-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Display the selection box under the correct
	circumstances. We were rendering white text with no selection box
	before.

2005-09-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs(Split): Now updates selection start/end if it points 
	  into a line that's being split. Fixes a FIXME and bug #75258

2005-09-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Binding.cs:
	* ListControl.cs: Don't use the path when retrieving binding
	managers from the binding context. My bat sense tells me that the
	path is only used on insertion.

2005-09-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Splitter.cs: Set the cursor an easier way. (Thanks peter).

2005-09-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Splitter.cs: There are special cursors used for splitting.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: The VSplit and HSplit cursors were backwards.

2005-09-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Splitter.cs: Change the cursor appropriately when the splitter
	is moused over, so the user actually knows there is a splitter
	there.

2005-09-22 Hisham Mardam Bey <hisham.mardambey@gmail.com>

       * Label.cs : Fix ToString method to give same output as MS.NET

2005-09-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Create the scrollbars when the handle is created
	and add them right away, just make them invisble. Also account for
	the window being shrunk vertically to the point that the vert
	scrollbar needs to be added.
	- Remove some 0.5 adjustments to get around anti aliasing issues.
	
2005-09-22  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>
	 
	* MainMenu.cs: Fixes default value
	* MenuItem.cs: Fixes default value

2005-09-22  Kazuki Oikawa  <kazuki@panicode.com>

	* AsyncMethodResult.cs: Fixes Control.Invoke is blocked infinitely.

2005-09-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Don't try to set the border style on the window if
	it hasn't been created. When the window is created the border
	style will be used.

2005-09-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (Update): Don't call XplatUI if we don't have a
	  window handle yet

2005-09-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* ContainerControl.cs: Instead of throwing an exception, print
	  a one-time warning about Validate not being implemented
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Removed debug output

2005-09-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: Only set XplatUI background if we expect the windowing
	  system to handle the background. This stops controls that draw their
	  own background from flickering

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Support custom visuals and colormaps for window 
	  creation. This allows, amongst other things, using MWF X11 windows 
	  with OpenGL.

2005-09-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	  - some refactoring

2005-08-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* CreateParams.cs (ToString): Made output match MS
	* Control.cs (Text): Don't set Text or Focus via XplatUI unless 
	    handle is already created (to avoid forcing window creation)
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Set window text to caption after creating window,
	  in case Text was set before window was created
	* Form.cs: Use this.Text instead of a static string as caption

2005-08-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* NotifyIcon.cs: Don't set the window to visible; this screws
	  up Win32 (causes WM_NCPAINT to be sent on Win32, which calls
	  OnPaint without a bitmap)
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Removed Visible optimization in AddExpose; doesn't 
	  happen very often anyway; we could add the check to the WM_PAINT 
	  event generation code

2005-08-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* NotifyIcon.cs: Fill the icon area with a background color, to 
	  avoid 'residue' when transparent icons are drawn
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Handle whole_window == client_window when destroying windows
	  - SystrayAdd(): Set client_window to whole_window value to
	    get mouse and other events passed to NotifyIcon

2005-08-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs: Set proper default for Opacity property
	* NotifyIcon.cs:
	  - ShowSystray(): Don't bother creating telling the OS
	    about the systray item if no icon is provided
	  - Now handles WM_NCPAINT message to deal with whole/client window
	    split
	  - Create window as visible to not get caught by Expose optimization
	* Hwnd.cs: Removed debug message
	* ComboBox.cs, ScrollBar.cs, ListBox.cs, TrackBar.cs, TabControl.cs,
	  StatusBar.cs, TreeView.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs: Switched 
	    PaintEventStart/End to use new client argument
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Commented out debug messages
	  - Switched PaintEventStart/End to use new client argument
	* XplatUI.cs: Added client window bool to PaintEventStart()/
	  PaintEventEnd() calls, to support drawing in non-client areas
	* XplatUIDriver.cs: 
	  - Added client window bool to PaintEventStart()/PaintEventEnd() 
	    calls, to support drawing in non-client areas
	  - Added conditional compile to allow using MWF BeginInvoke 
	    on MS runtime
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Added some conditional debug output
	  - Fixed SystrayAdd() method to support new (for SystrayAdd, anyway)
	    whole/client window split
	  - Implemented handling of client argument to PaintEventStart()/End()
	* Control.cs:
	  - Throw exception if BeginInvoke() is called and the window handle
	    or one of the window's parent handles is not created
	  - Added conditional compile to allow using MWF BeginInvoke on
	    MS runtime
	  - get_Parent(): Only sets parent if handle is created. This avoids
	    forcing window handle creation when parent is set.
	  - Now fires Layout and Parent changed events in proper order
	  - Switched to use Handle instead of window.Handle for Z-Order setting,
	    the get_Parent() patch above causes us to possibly get null for 'window'
	  - Implemented handling of client argument to PaintEventStart()/End()
	  - Now reports back to windows that WM_SETCURSOR was handled (to avoid
	    default handling)
	  - Now sends a Refresh() to all child windows when Refresh() is called

2005-08-29  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs: Added (non-functional) Opacity property
	* XplatUIWin32.cs (SystrayAdd): Removed bogus line of code

2005-08-29  Alexander Olk  <xenomorph2@onlinehome.de>

	  if enabled

2005-08-25  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com> 

	* Splitter.cs: Resize docked control and its neighbor.

2005-08-24  Rafael Teixeira <rafaelteixeirabr@hotmail.com> 
	-- Making Windows with Menus layout correctly --
	* Form.cs : The first leg of the fix
		Menu setter - adjust Client Size as needed to make space for the menu
		SetClientSizeCore - doesn't call base version to be able to pass the 
			menu handle to XplatUI.CalculateWindowRect
	* Hwnd.cs: Fix for menu_height, now gets from MenuAPI.MENU
	* XplatUIX11.cs: The critical second leg of the fix
		GetWindowPos needs to use a recalculated client_rect
		so that resizing the window doesn't break layout of child controls. 
		Also a more complete rule to avoid X Server roundtrips in SetWindowPos
		Lots of \t\n killed

2005-08-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Label.cs: Now properly recalculates width and height on Font and Text

	    and properly extending in either direction (SetSelectionToCaret(),
	    SetSelectionStart() and SetSelectionEnd())

	    calculates delta between previous and new selection and only
	    invalidates/redraws that area
	  - Fixed FindPos() math off-by-one errors
	  - Changed DeleteChars() to verify the provided tag covers the
	    provided position, selections may have a tag that doesn't cover
	    the position if the selection is at a tag border
	  - Fixed off-by-one errors in DeleteChars()
	  - Added missing streamlining check in DeleteChars() to remove
	    zero-length tags
	  - Implemented Invalidate() method, now properly calculates exposures
	    between two given lines/positions

	    cr/lf when counting (Fixes RichTextBox.SelectionFont issues)

	    * Fixed crashes when multiple tags on a single line were selected
	    * fixed selection box drawing not overlaying text
	    * fixed bogus offset calculation for tags not starting at index 1
	    * Switched behaviour from using multiple Substrings of a 
	      StringBuilder.ToString() to using multiple 
	      StringBuilder.ToString(start, length) statements, hoping this is
	      faster (kept original version commented out in the code, in case
	      original version was faster)
	* TextBox.cs (set_TextAlignment): TextBox always needs to wrap if 
	  alignment != Left

	hatch brush.

2005-04-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Don't fill the middle of progress

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Don't fill the background for picture
	boxes. This could overright user drawing.

	determining how much of the client area is available.

2005-04-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Give the picture box drawing code a clip
	rectangle. The internal paint_area var has been removed from
	StatusBar. The clipping rect should be used instead.
	* Theme.cs: Give the PictureBox drawing method a clipping rect.
	* TabPage.cs: The RefreshTabs method was removed, so just call the
	tab controls Refresh method now.
	* TabControl.cs: Update to new double buffering. Make sure the
	handle is created before sizing the tab pages, otherwise we will
	get stuck in a loop.

	regardless of whether or not they were in the clipping rectangle.

2005-04-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* CurrencyManager.cs: There are four rules for GetItemProperties:
	- If the type is an array use the element type of the array
	- If the type is a typed list, use the type
	- If the list contains an Item property that is not an object, use
	that property
	- use the first element of the list if there are any elements in
	the list.
	
2005-04-17  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.oom>

	  - Now draws simple rectangle around test area to make it obvious
	    there's a control. This is a hack until we properly support borders
	  - A few simple fixes to support selections better, now erases selected
	    text when typing, and resets selection when using movement keys

2005-01-19  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* UpDownBase.cs: Added some new properties.

	* DomainUpDown.cs: Implement a lot to get my test working.

2005-01-18  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Button.cs: Implemented DoubleClick event
	* ButtonBase.cs:
	  - Fixed keyboard handling to behave like MS, where the press of
	    Spacebar is equivalent to a mousedown, and the key release is
	    equivalent to mouseup. Now a spacebar push will give the same
	    visual feedback like a mouse click.

	  - Added case to select form itself as focused form if no child
	    controls exist
	  - Added PerformLayout call when showing dialog, to ensure properly
	    placed controls
	* Control.cs:
	  - Select(): Made internal so Form can access it
	  - Focus(): Only call Xplat layer if required (avoids loop), and sets
	    status
	* Application.cs (Run): Removed hack and calls PerformLayout instead
	  to trigger calculation when Form becomes visible

2005-01-18  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: fixes for ownerdraw

2005-01-18  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs:
	  - Sentinel is no longer static, each Document gets it's own, this
	    avoids locking or alternatively overwrite problems when more
	    than one text control is used simultaneously.
	  - Switched to use Hilight and HilightText brushes for text selection

	  style to avoid interference with internal click handler (which is
	  different than standard Control click handling)
	* RadioButton.cs:
	  - Now unchecks all sibling radio buttons when control is
	    selected (Fixes #68756)
	  - Removed internal tabstop variable, using the one inherited from

	  and DestroyCursor() methods.
	* Cursor.cs: Partially implemented, now supports standard cursors;
	  still contains some debug code

	* Control.cs:
	  - WndProc(): Added handling of WM_SETCURSOR message, setting the

2005-01-14  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Draw a gray box instead of a grip in the lower
	right hand corner when there are both horizontal and vertical
	scroll bars.

2005-01-14  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: When erasing backgrounds use FromHwnd instead of
	FromHdc when there is a NULL wparam. This occurs on the X driver.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Set the wparam to NULL.

2005-01-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* PictureBox.cs: Implement missing methods (except ToString, need
	to test that on windows) and events. When visibility is changed we
	need to redraw the image because the buffers are killed. When size
	is changed refresh if the sizemode needs it.

2005-01-13  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (SelectNextControl): Was using wrong method to select

	created, enable it.

	Use a TextBox instead of a Label.

2005-01-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Refresh the tree after sorting the nodes. Always
	draw the connecting node lines (when ShowLines is true).
	* TreeNode.cs: The nodes index can now be updated. This is used
	when a node collection is sorted.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Implement sorting. Nodes can be sorted on
	insert or an existing unsorted node collection can be sorted.
	
2005-01-12  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

2005-01-12  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs:
	  - Fixed broken Contains() method
	  - Implemented GetNextControl() method. Finally. This is the pre-
	    requisite for focus handling.

2005-01-12  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* OSXStrucs.cs: Added

2005-01-12  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	button mouse).


2005-01-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Still need to draw lines to siblings even if out of
	the current node is out of the clip.

2005-01-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: When setting the hbar/vbar/grip position use
	SetBounds so that perform layout is only called once. Also suspend
	and resume layout so layout is only done once for all controls.
	- Removed some debug fluff
	* SizeGrip.cs: Call base implmentation in overriding methods.
	- When visibility is changed the drawing buffers are killed so we
	need to redraw.

2005-01-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Calculate the open node count while drawing. This
	saves us an entire tree traversal for every paint operation. Use
	a member var for the open node count so less vars are passed around.

2005-01-11  John BouAntoun  <jba-mono@optusnet.com.au>

	* MonthCalendar.cs:
	- fixed selection to use mousemove, not mouse polling on timer
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs
	- removed redundant unused variable "no_more_content"
	
2005-01-11  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (DoEvents): Needs to return when no more events
	  are pending, so it now calls PeekMessage instead of GetMessage;
	  implemented a incomplete version of PeekMessage
	
2005-01-11  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Switched P/Invokes to unicode charset to avoid
	  I18n issues
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Added sending of TextChanged event

2005-01-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: keyboard navigation, item navigation, bug fixes

2005-01-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs:
	- Implement fast scrolling. Now only the newly
	exposed nodes are drawn and the old image is moved using the
	XplatUI::ScrollWindow method.
	- Factor in height of nodes when calculating whether or not the
	node is in the clipping rect.

2005-01-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* SizeGrip.cs: New internal class that is used as a sizing
	grip control...hence the name.

2005-01-09  Peter Bartok <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Form.cs:
	  - Implemented SetDesktopBounds method
	  - Implemented SetDesktopLocation method

2005-01-08  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	when drawing.

2005-01-08  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@customerdna.com>

        * XplatUIOSX.cs: Fix GetWindowState & SetWindowState

2005-01-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Just update the single node when it is
	checked. Don't refresh after toggling, the Expand/Collapse already
	handles this.
	* TreeView.cs: Respect clipping a little more when drawing. Try
	not to redraw things that don't need to be redrawn. Just hide the
	scrollbars when they are no longer needed instead of removing
	them, so they don't have to be created again and again.
	
2005-01-07  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@customerdna.com>

	* XplatUIOSX.cs (SetCaretPos):  We need to translate the view
	coordinates to window space to place the caret properly, FIXED.
	Implement GetWindowState & SetWindowState

2005-01-06  Peter Bartok <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Form.cs:
	  - Implemented OnActivated and OnDeactivate event trigger
	  - Implemented Activate() method
	  - Fixed ShowDialog() to activate the form that was active before
	    the dialog was shown
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Added global active_window var that tracks the currently active
	    X11 window
	  - Now always grabs Property changes from the root window to always
	    catch changes on the active window property
	  - Added code to PropertyNotify handler to send Active/Inactive
	    messages when state changes. This puts X11 and Win32 en par on
	    WM_ACTIVATE notifications (except for double notifications when
	    the user clicks away from our modal window to another one of our
	    windows)

	  XplatUIOSX.cs: Added GetActive method to return the currently
	  active window for the application (or null, if none is active)
	* Form.cs:
	  - Implemented ActiveForm
	  - Commented out owner assignment for modal dialogs (causes problems
	    on Win32, since the owner will be disabled)
	  - Reworked some Active/Focus handling (still incomplete)
	* CommonDialog.cs: Commented out owner assignment for modal dialogs
	  (causes problems on Win32, since the owner will be disabled)
	* IWin32Window: Added ComVisible attribute

2005-01-05  Peter Bartok <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ToolTip.cs (WndProc): Enable setting focus now that we have the

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs,
	  XplatUIX11.cs, X11Structs.cs, Form.cs: Framework code required
	  to implement focus and activation handling; still incomplete and

	* TreeNode.cs: Patches by Kazuki Oikawa (kazuki@panicode.com) for
	handling focus, return correct colors and fonts,

	    without WS_CAPTION
	  - Moved EventMask selection before mapping of newly created window
	    so we can catch the map event as well
	  - Implemented Activate() method via the _WM_ACTIVE_WINDOW property
	  - Added various Atom related DllImports
	  - Implemented Exit() method
	  - .ctor() : No longer shows window if WS_VISIBLE is not defined

	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Added lookup of pixel value for background color; tries to get a
	    color 'close' to the requested color, it avoids having to create a
	    colormap.  Depending on the display this could mean the used color
