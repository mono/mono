	* XplatUIX11.cs: Don't handle configurenotifys if PostQuitState is
	true.
	* ScrollBar.cs: When doing increments and decrements we need to
	set the Value property so that ValueChanged gets raised. A
	possible optimization here would be to make an internal SetValue
	that doesn't invalidate immediately.
	* ToolTip.cs: Tooltips get added to their container (when
	supplied) so they get disposed when the container is disposed.
	* Form.cs: Don't set topmost when setting the owner if the handles
	haven't been created yet.  The topmost set will happen when the
	handles are created.

2006-03-22  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - DeriveWindowStyles: Fixed typo in borderstyle generation (#77828)
	  - SetVisible: Sending WINDOWPOSCHANGED for all controls when made 
	    visible (to allow them to recalculate their sizes)

2006-03-21  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: major refactoring of the ToolBar rendering
	methods. Removed a ton of redundant code.  Still not really happy with
	the border rendering, but I think that's mainly because of the
	ControlDarkDark being black instead of a dark grey. Depending on how 
	close we want to be, we might want to revisit those color choices.
	Among the new features added during the refactor were DropDownArrow
	pressed rendering, Disabled image rendering.  Proper flat appearance
	boundary rendering.  Removed the Divider and Wrapping dividers since I
	can't figure out any combination of themes and conditions to make the
	MS control draw a horizontal line on a toolbar despite what the
	Divider property docs indicate.
	* ToolBar.cs: rewrite the layout engine. Fixes numerous flicker
	conditions and incorrect layout.  Updated to coding standard.
	* ToolBarButton.cs: refactored layout and positioning code from
	ToolBar to here.  Invalidate wherever possible instead of forcing
	redraws of the whole toolbar. 
	(Known remaining issues: explicit ButtonSize smaller than provided
	images.)

2006-03-21  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ContextMenu.cs (Show): use the position parameter instead of just
	showing at the MousePosition.

2006-03-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Remove the call to ProcessKeyEventArgs and let
	control handle this.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: If we are clearing the root node we need
	to reset top_node so calcs can still happen.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: This is a Flags so we need to check
	properly.
	
2006-03-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: Create columns when the binding context has been
	changed.
	* X11Structs.cs: Keysyms are uints.
	- Add size to fix build.

2006-03-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs, 
	  XplatUIOSX.cs: 
	  - Added ResetMouseHover method to allow controls to retrigger
	    hovering if they need it more than once
	  - Implemented MouseHoverTime and MouseHoverSize properties
	* Timer.cs: Start() must reset the interval
	* SystemInformation.cs: Added 2.0 MouseHoverTime and MouseHoverSize
	  properties

2006-03-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Keyboard.cs: improved layout detection. Move the nonchar
	tables into this file.
	* KeyboardLayouts.cs: Move the tables into resource files.

2006-03-21  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: use OnItemActivated to raise events. Fixes #77834.

2006-03-21  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* Mime.cs: Various speed optimizations. Looking up mime types
	  is now 2 times faster than before

2006-03-17  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* CreateParams.cs: Added internal menu field
	* Control.cs: 
	  - Switched call order for UpdateBounds; now we always call
	    the one that also takes ClientSize, and we're calculating the 
	    client size via driver method in the others. The previous
	    method of tracking client size by difference wasn't working
	    for forms where even the starting client size wouldn't match
	    the overall form size (due to borders) (Part of fix for #77729)
	  - CreateParams(): Do not use parent.Handle unless the handle is
	    already created. Causes havoc with Nexxia and throws off our
	    creation of controls
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Created new PerformNCCalc method to trigger WM_NCCALCSIZE message
	  - Switched handling of ConfigureNotify over to new PerformNCCalc 
	    method (consolidates code)
	  - Changed RequestNCRecalc to use new PerformNCCalc method
	  - Added calls to RequestNCRecalc when menus and borders are changed
	    to allow app to set NC size. (Part of fix for #77729) This matches
	    when MS send a WM_NCRECALC on Win32 windows.
	  - Now sending WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED when toplevel for is made visible
	    (Part of fix for #77729). This matches what MS does, they also
	    send that message when the form is made visible.
	  - XException.GetMessage: Improved usability of X errors by including
	    a translation of the window into Hwnd and Control class
	  - Improved debug info for window creation, reparenting and destruction
	  - Created helper method WindowIsMapped() [Currently not used]
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Added ToString() debug helper to RECT structure
	* Form.cs:
	  - CreateParams: Now setting our menu on the new internal menu field
	  - SetClientSizeCore: Now passing cp.menu instead of ActiveMenu to
	    avoid calculating the same property twice
	* Hwnd.cs:
	  - Improved usability of ToString() for debugging purposes
	  - GetWindowRectangle(): Now uses proper CalcMenuBarSize method to
	    determine the height of the menu, instead of just the font. This
	    required to also create a graphics context and to keep a bmp 
	    around (for performance reasons)

2006-03-17  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Added OnMouseUp method
	* Form.cs:
	  - Now remembering the requested client size, avoids size errors
	  - WndProc: Now handling WM_xBUTTONUP and passing it to MenuTracker
	    instead of base if the menu is active. This is required due to
	    control now capturing and releasing on down/up and it would
	    prematurely release our menu capture

2006-03-17  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* KeyboardLayouts.cs: Add the czech layouts.

2006-03-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Use the viewport space when sizing not the controls
	client size, so things like ScrollableControl that effect the
	viewport size (when scrollbars are added) are computed correctly.
	* BindingContext.cs: Cleanup to use the DataSourceEntrys instead
	of ManagerEntrys.
	- Handle creating BindingManagers for null data sources.
	* DataGrid.cs: Bind the cached_currencymgr_events to the real data
	source, otherwise when rows are added they are added to the 'fake'
	datasource and we will crash when trying to set the position in
	those rows.
	- Use Implicit scrollbars on the datagrid so they arent
	selectable.
	
2006-03-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Binding.cs:
	* InternalWindowManager.cs:
	* MdiWindowManager.cs:
	* X11Keyboard.cs: I really want Mike to love me again (fix
	compiler warnings).

2006-03-16  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* DataGrid.cs:
	  - OnMouseDown: Switch to editing mode when clicking on the cell
	                 even if we're clicking on the cell that's currently 
	                 selected
	  - ProcessGridKey: Left/Right now wrap like MS.Net does
	  - ProcessGridKey: Tab now knows to add a new row when tab is
	                    pressed in the cell of the last column of the 
	                    last row
	  - ProcessGridKey: Enter now adds another row  if pressed in the last
	                    row and selectes the new row, same column cell
	  - ProcessGridKey: Home/End navigate columns, not rows, like 
	                    originally implemented
	  - Broke ProcessKeyPreview code out into an extra Internal method
	    so it can be called from the edit code
	* DataGridTextBox.cs (ProcessKeyMessage):
	  - Switched to accept Tab keypresses
	  - Added F2 handling to allow jumping to the end of the edited cell
	  - Added logic to allow moving caret left/right inside edited cell
	    and making the edited cell jump when the caret hits cell borders
	  - Tab and Enter are now passed to the datagrid after being handled
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Removed capture code now that Control handles it
	  - set_SelectionStart now ensures caret is visible

2006-03-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TrackBar.cs: Debackwards the increment/decrement for handling
	mouse clicks on the bar with vertical trackbars.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Draw vertical trackbars with 0 at the
	bottom to match MS.

2006-03-16  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: make shift/ctrl keyboard and mouse selection 
	consistent with the MS control. Fix a bug in
	SelectedListViewItemCollection.Clear that was pissing me off for the
	better part of a day because the collection was being altered
	underneath us as we walked the list.

2006-03-16  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: Not sure how we could miss this so long, but it seems
	  that MS.Net has Capture set all the way from before calling 
	  OnMouseDown through sending the mouse events until after
	  OnMouseUp. This will fix DataGrid's selection being set to end
	  at the location of the MouseUp.

2006-03-15  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* BindingContext.cs: Check the binding after its added so that it
	  can initialize the binding managers and hookup to events.
	* Binding.cs: Data members seem to sometimes include rows/cols in
	  the format Row.Column we now take this into account.
	  - Hookup to the position changed event so we can update the
	  control when the position has changed in the data set.
	* CurrencyManager.cs: Take into account the row/col naming
	  convention when creating dataset tables.
	* BindingContext.cs: Using a newer better way of storing
	  datasource/datamember pairs.  Hopefully this better matches MS for
          looking up binding managers.


2006-03-15  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* BindingContext.cs: The currency manager needs the data member
	name, if the member is a data set we use the name to find the
	correct table.
	* CurrencyManager.cs: When creating the list prefer an IList over
	an IListSource.
	- Attempt to create a DataTable from a DataSet (TODO: might need
	some better error checking here, although MS doesn't seem to have much)
	- If we have a DataTable create a view and use it as our list.

2006-03-15  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: keep a matrix of the icon mode layout to facilitate
	keyboard navigation. Support Up/Down/Left/Right selection correctly
	for all 4 View modes.
	* ListViewItem.cs: add internal row/col fields for icon layouts.

2006-03-15  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Redraw the tabs when we resize so their newly
	calculated sizes are drawn on screen.
	* X11Keyboard.cs: Begginnings of XIM support.  We also now support
	composite characters.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Keyboard driver needs to know about focus changes
	- filter events so that composite characters can be created
	patches by peter
	* X11Structs.cs: Add XIMProperties enum.

2006-03-14  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs (BringToFront, SendToBack): Don't use window or handle
	  unless it's created

2006-03-14  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (PerformLayout): We don't need to consider visiblity
	  for anchoring, only for docking. This fixes 'whacky' alignment
	  in listbox and other controls that use implicit scrollbars after
	  the previous PerformLayout patch
	* ListBox.cs: Switched to use implicit scrollbars
	  
2006-03-14  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ToolBar.cs: 
	* VScrollBar.cs:
	- chain up the "new event" overrides to base and use
	OnEvent to raise them.  Part of fix for bug #76509.

2006-03-14  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Do not select an item in the parent directory
	  on backspace

2006-03-14  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs (PerformLayout): It would seem that we considered
	  invisible windows for our layout. Not quite the right thing
	  to do. Now we don't any longer, thereby fixing bug #76889.

2006-03-14  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (CanFocus): I goofed. A control can have focus 
	  even though it's not selectable. Made it match MS docs.

2006-03-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ControlPaint.cs (DrawBorder3D): DrawBorder3D does not fill the
	  center by default (fixes #76895)
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs, ThemeNice.cs, ThemeClearlooks.cs: Replaced 
	  all uses of Border3DSides.All with the explicit ORd together
	  Left|Right|Top|Bottom because I assume that nobody was aware 
	  that All also implies a center fill. Most places I checked had
	  a fill right above.
	* ProgressBarStyle.cs: Added

2006-03-13  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: fix breakage in drag shadow header positioning 
	from Peter's csc compilation fix.

2006-03-13  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: fix NRE produced by backspacing twice in a focused
	FileDialog.

2006-03-13  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: proxy Key(Down|Up) from ItemControl to ListView.

2006-03-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Hwnd.cs: Added fixed_size field to track windows whose size cannot
	  be changed
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Now setting fixed_size on hwnd and if set, re-setting
	  the allowed size before making programmatic size changes

2006-03-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Don't call XSetWMNormalHints if no flags are 
	  set, metacity is broken and will still use the emty sizes in 
	  the struct. (Fix for #77089)

2006-03-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIStructs.cs: Split WindowStyles into WindowStyles and 
	  WindowExStyles and marked both enums as Flags
	* Form.cs, ComboBox.cs, ToolTip.cs, Control.cs, PropertyGridView.cs,
	  NotifyIcon.cs, MenuAPI.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs, MonthCalendar.cs: Updated
	  to match WindowStyles split
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - SetWMStyles: Added cehck to not apply WM attributes to Child windows
	  - Updated to match WindowStyles split
	* XplatUIWin32.cs:
	  - Fixed FosterParent creation, was using ExStyle on the Style field
	    (This should help with Popup focus issues)
	  - Updated to match WindowStyles split

2006-03-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Use the system menu height. Fixes some
	strange sizing issues.

2006-03-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: Need to scroll to caret after text is inserted (#77672)
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Scroll to caret after inserting text (#77672)
	  - Make scroll range one pixel higher, fixes off-by-one error (and
	    makes underlines visible on the last line)

2006-03-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Added call to new Keyboard.ResetKeyState to prevent
	  the keyboard state from being stuck with keys in 'pressed' state when
	  focus is switched away via keyboard
	* X11Keyboard.cs: Added new ResetKeyState method to allow drivers to
	  reset the keyboard if no X11 KeyUp events are expected to come
	* X11Structs.cs: Switched type of Visible to bool to match driver

2006-03-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs:
	  - Switched caret to be just 1 pixel wide, matches MS and looks less
	    clunky
	  - Moved caret display 1 pixel down from the top of the control
	    to improve view
	  - InsertCharAtCharet: Update the selection start if moving the caret
	    (fixes bug #77696; based on patch suggested by kazuki@panicode.com)
	  - No longer always creating the caret when the caret methods are
	    called. Only the actual ShowCaret/HideCaret will do that now
	  - Only setting caret visible if the owner control has focus
	  - UpdateView: Added invalidation-shortcut logic for center and right 
	    aligned text. Previously we'd update all according to the left
	    logic which caused drawing errors. Also fixed height of invalidated
	    areas, now properly invalidating the whole area (was off-by-one)
	  - owner_HandleCreated: Always generate the document when the
	    handle is created; this ensures that 
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Fixed situation where caret would disappear under the right
	    window border, also improved scrolling behaviour on left-
	    aligned textboxes
	  - Fixed right-aligned textboxes to have a border to the
	    right instead of the caret being under the right border
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Switched from 'nested' to simple visible/not visible tracking 
	    for caret (part of fix for #77671)
	  - No longer passing through translated FocusIn/FocusOut messages
	    since we were notifying too often and the wrong windows. Instead
	    we just notify our focussed window of receiving or loosing focus
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Switched from 'nested' show/hide 
	  counting for caret to simple visible yes/no behaviour (part of 
	  fix for #77671)

2006-03-11  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* Mime.cs: Remove debug code...

2006-03-11  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeGenerated.cs: Removed
	* Mime.cs: Mime now reads the mime data (magic, globs, aliases
	  and subclasses) from /usr/(local/)share/mime and
	  $HOME/.local/share/mime.

2006-03-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Recalc the NC area when a window is
	maximized/restored so that the menu area is drawn on forms that
	don't have a menu.

2006-03-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs,
	  XplatUIX11.cs: Added RequestNCRecalc method to driver to allow
	  us to force a WM_NCCALCRESIZE message being sent. This is needed
	  for MDI maximizing.

2006-03-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: We need to use the ActiveMenu when calculating menu
	height.
	- Fix nullref when the window manager hasn't been created yet.
	* Control.cs: Fix nullref when we try to bring a control to the
	front that has no parent.
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Use the MaximizedMenu for calculating
	height.
	- Add a dummy item to the maximized menu so it always has the
	correct height. Otherwise when there are no menus we don't get our
	icon and buttons.
	

2006-03-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Make this available elsewhere. I need it in some MDI
	stuff.
	* Form.cs: Make the window_state internal so the window managers
	can track it.
	- When an MDI child is maximized let its window manager create the
	main menu (so it can add its icon).
	- Notify the window managers of state changes
	- Let the window manager paint its buttons and handle button
	clicks on the menu when it is maximized.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Move the prev_bounds into the mdi
	window manager, since tool windows don't use it, only mdi windows.
	- Tell the main form that we don't want it to handle NCPAINT
	itself to avoid extra painting.
	- Handle clicks on a maximized windows menu.
	- Handle window state changes
	- Handle minimize/maximize clicks correctly by setting the window state.
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Add an icon menu that (the menu you get
	when clicking on the forms icon).
	- New method to create a forms maximized menu. This is its normal
	menu + an icon.
	- Handle window state changes.
	- Handle sizing of maximized windows.  Maximized windows are just
	drawn bigger then the parent visible area. All controls are still
	there, they are just outside the visible area (this matches windows).
	* MdiClient.cs: No scrollbars when a child window is maximized.
	- Let the children windows figure out how big they should be when
	sizing maximized windows.
	- Implement a version of ArrangeIconicWindows somewhat similar to
	Windows version.  There are some little differences, but I don't
	think any app will rely on the layout of minimized mdi windows.

2006-03-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Padding.cs: Several fixes to allow compiling with csc 2.0

2006-03-09  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Menu.cs:
	* MenuItem.cs: Cheap hack so we can add items to the list without
	the events being raised.  This allows adding mdi items during
	drawing. TODO: Should probably find a better time to add the items.

2006-03-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	  - CheckBox_DrawText: Added logic to not wrap if not enough space
	    is available (Fix for bug #77727)
	  - RadioButton_DrawText: Added logic not to wrap if not enough
	    space is available (Fix for bug #77727). Also removed some
	    duplicate code, DrawString always drawing the regular text
	    before hitting the if statement.

2006-03-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Handle an unmapped window state in SetWindowState

2006-03-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* PictureBox.cs: Implemented ISupportInitialize interface (fixes #77726)
	* ContainerControl.cs: Partial implementation of some 2.0 scaling
	  methods. Moved the new 2.0 properties into alphabetical order with
	  other properties and added MonoTODO tags

2006-03-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* AutoScaleMode.cs: Added. Fix build.

2006-03-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs, 
	  XplatUIOSX.cs: Removed HWnd argument from CalcuateClientRect, not used
	  and was requiring premature handle creation for calls from above
	* Form.cs, Control.cs: Removed handle arguments from calls to
	  CalculateClientRect()

2006-03-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* ListView.cs (HeaderMouseMove): Fix csc compilation. 
	  drag_column.column_rect is MarshalByRef and can't be used that way

2006-03-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* AxHost.cs: Added deserialization constructor for 
	  AxHost+State (fixes 77743)

2006-03-09  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: 
	- Added column drag reordering for details view.
	- fixed behavior when mouse is dragged off column and
	AllowColumnReorder is false.
	* ColumnHeader.cs: clone the format too in Clone.
	* Theme.cs: add DrawListViewHeaderDragDetails method.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	- impl new method for drawing drag column shadows and targets.
	- support column offset for details mode in DrawListViewItem.

2006-03-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Reset the char_count when the document is cleared
	  (Fixes bug reported on mono-winforms mailing list)

2006-03-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Honor the Handled state of KeyPress events. Instead
	  of calling base we simply process the key ourselves, since both
	  DefWindowProc and the handled method would set m.Result. 
	  (Fixes #77732)

2006-03-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Form.cs(ScaleCore): No longer calling base.ScaleCore since that
	  method also moves the window; instead implemented a copy of
	  Control.ScaleCore (Part of fix for #77456)
	* TextBoxBase.cs: 
	  - Created new CreateGraphicsInternal method to allow providing
	    a graphics context when no handle is created without triggering
	    handle creation. (Part of fix for #77456)
	  - Replaced use of Control.CreateGraphics with CreateGraphicsInternal
	* TextControl.cs: 
	  - Switched Constructor to require TextBoxBase instead of Control (to
	    allow uncast access to CreateGraphicsInternal)
	  - Safeguarded use of owner.Handle property. No longer accessing it
	    unless the handle is already created.
	  - Replaced use of Control.CreateGraphics with CreateGraphicsInternal
	  - Now triggering a recalc when owning control becomes visible
	* TextBox.cs, RichTextBox.cs: Switched to use new internal 
	  TextBoxBase.CreateGraphicsInternal() method to avoid triggering
	  premature handle creation (Part of fix for #77456)
	* Control.cs:
	  - We now only destroy our double-buffering buffers when the
	    control is resized or disposed, but not when visibility
	    changes. (The code even re-created them twice every time)
	  - Now requiring a redraw of the buffer on visibility changes
	    (fixes bug 77654 part 2)
	  - Not passing OnParentVisibleChanged up unless the control
	    is visible
	  - CanFocus: Fixed to match MS documentation
	  - Focus: Fixed to return actual focus state and to check if
	    setting focus is legal before setting it

2006-03-08  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: TabPages cannot have focus. Determine
	  when to draw focus rectangle by looking at parent focus and
	  selected state instead. This fixes TabPages on Linux sometimes
	  having none or multiple focus rectangles.
	* XplatUIX11.cs (SetFocus): 
	  - Don't set the focus if the same window already has focus
	  - Use SendMessage instead of PostMessage (like it's Win32
	    equivalent) and send the WM_SETFOCUS before the WM_KILLFOCUS
	    to match MS behaviour
	* TabControl.cs(SelectedIndex): Don't set Focus on TabPage, TabPages
	  are not selectable.

2006-03-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* PictureBox.cs: Revert line I accidently committed last week.

2006-03-07  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: 
	  - Added new IsRecreating and ParentIsRecreating properties to
	    allow testing if RecreateHandle has been called on ourselves
	    or one of our parents
	  - WndProc(WM_DESTROY): If our control handle is being recreated
	    we immediately need to create the handle when receiving the
	    destroy, that way our child windows find a valid parent handle
	    when they themselves are being recreated upon WM_DESTROY receipt
	    (fix for bug #77654 part 1)
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - DestroyWindow: WM_DESTROY must be sent to our own window before
	    notifying any child windows. MS documents that child windows
	    are still valid when WM_DESTROY is received. (Control now relies on
	    this behaviour)
	  - Added some fine-grain debug options

2006-03-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Redid scrolling logic a bit to create a virtual
	box and base calculations off this.
	* MdiChildContext.cs:
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Don't need to ensure scrollbars here
	anymore.
	
2006-03-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Splitter.cs: In situations where the affected control is added
	  to the parent's control list after the splitter, we would not
	  populate affected. Now we try populating it on mousedown, if
	  it's not already set, and force it to be re-set whenever our
	  parent changes.

2006-03-03  Matt Hargett  <matt@use.net>

	* Control.cs: implement Control.Padding
	* Padding.cs: -Padding.All returns -1 when constructing with the
	implicit default ctor
	-Padding.ToString() matches MS.NET
	* ContainerControl.cs: implement
	ContainerControl.AutoScaleDimensions
	* ListControl.cs: implement ListControl.FormattingEnabled
	* TextBox.cs: Implemented TextBox.UseSystemPasswordChar.
	* ButtonBase.cs:
	* TabPage.cs: Implement UseVisualStyleBackColor.
	* PictureBox.cs: Implement PictureBox.InitialImage.

2006-03-03  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: Refactor into HeaderControl and ItemControl. Fix new
	event declarations to proxy to base event.
	* ListViewItem.cs: update to use ItemControl.
	* Theme.cs: make DrawListViewHeader. s/DrawListView/DrawListViewItems.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: update to new ListView theme API and fix
	column header label rendering for 0 width columns.

2006-03-03  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (ControlCollection.SetChildIndex): Avoid using a call
	  that causes the control to be created. Fixes #77476.

2006-03-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Hwnd.cs: Clear the nc pending when clearing the NC area, not the
	expose_pending.

2006-03-02  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Implemented 2.0 feature where OnClick has MouseEventArgs
	  passed in for the EventArgs (fixes #77690)

2006-03-01  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs: Refresh afterbeing resized.

2006-02-28  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Call PerformPopup internal method to emit Popup.
	Clean up a tracker compile warning.
	* MenuItem.cs: add internal PerformPopup method.
	[Fixes #77457]

2006-02-28  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextBoxBase.cs (set_Text): Recalculate the document (causing an
	  implicit expose) when the text is set to null

2006-02-28  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs (FlushText): When newline is true, we always
	  need to split the line, even if no text is on it and we may
	  never eat newlines. (Fixes #77669)

2006-02-28  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs: Add UpdateSelection internal method. Remove SelectItem 
	and set Selected instead.
	* ListViewItem.cs: Call owner.UpdateSelection to manipulate the 
	collections.

2006-02-28  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* ComboBox.cs: Allow setting SelectedIndex to -1. Fixes #77665

2006-02-28  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FontDialog.cs:
	  - Got rid of the panel. All controls are now directly added to
	    the dialog form
	  - It is now possible to set a font with the Font property
	  - MinSize and MaxSize property do now what they should
	  - ShowApply, ShowHelp, ShowColor, ShowEffects likewise
	  - Searching and selecting a font with the font textbox works now,
	    the same applies to the style and size textbox
	  - Draw the correct 3D border in the example panel
	  - Fixed a little mem leak (unused fonts didn't get disposed)
	  - Many other internal updates/rewrites...
	  - Fix typo

2006-02-27  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextControl.cs: 
	  - InsertRTFFromStream: Added 'number of characters inserted' argument
	  - set_SelectedRTF: Now using the number of characters to calculate
	    the new location for the selection and cursor (x/y cannot be used
	    due to potentially already wrapped text)

2006-02-27  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Added property and implemented means to allow 
	  disabling recalculation of a document (can be used to speed up
	  multiple inserts and is needed to make RTF inserts predictable, see
	  bug #77659)
	* RichTextBox.cs: Using the new NoRecalc property of Document to
	  keep x/y insert locations predictable. Also makes it faster inserting
	  large chunks of RTF

2006-02-27  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: Separated special WM_SYSKEYUP keyboard handling. That way
	  it's easier for a child control to handle the other messages without
	  having to duplicate the special functionality
	* TextBoxBase.cs
	  - WndProc: Removed calling base handler for WM_KEYDOWN and added 
	    code to handle processing the key ourselves, in order to get 
	    access to the result of KeyEventArgs.Handled. We now only call 
	    ProcessKey if they key hasn't been handled already. Fixes #77526.
	  - set_Text: If null or empty string is given, just clear the 
	    document. Fixes part of #77526

2006-02-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* SizeGrip.cs: Paint the background color before painting the grip
	so things look right.
	* MdiClient.cs: Add the sizegrip when both scrollbars are used.

2006-02-27  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ListView.cs:
	  - Restructure layout and invalidation model to remove a ton of
	  flicker from the control and speed up performance in general.
	  - Add manual column resize, flickers like crazy, but I already have
	  some ideas on how I'll fix that. (#76822)
	  - Merge the three Icon-based views into a single layout method.
	  - Move item selection interaction logic from the item since 
	  interaction with the collections is more appropriate to the view.
	  - Deselection on non-item clicks.
	* ListViewItem.cs:
	  - Encapsulate most of the layout. Add some internal props to trigger
	  layout.  Move to a model where Items invalidate themselves instead
	  of just invalidating the whole control every time something changes.
	  - Invalidate on Text/Caption changes.
	  - switch to an offset based layout model to avoid having to absolute
	  position every element on item moves.
	  - correct checkbox layout to conform to MS layout.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	  - refactor some column header drawing code.
	  - fix string justification for column headers (#76821)
	  - make SmallIcon labels top justified for compat with MS impl.
	* ThemeClearlooks.cs:
	  - adjust to new ListViewItem internal checkbox bounds api.

2006-02-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs:  Change where implicit controls fall in the zorder.
	They are now on top of all children.
	- Synced AddImplicit code with Add
	- Removed unused enumerator.
	* SizeGrip.cs: Remove the TODO as its been TODONE.

2006-02-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextControl.cs(Insert): Combine the last lines unless the insertion
	  string ends with \n\n, otherwise we leave one line too many (Fixes
	  something I noticed with the testapp for #77526; the bug itself was
	  already fixed in the previous checkin)

2006-02-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs:
	  - SelectionColor and SelectionFont methods no longer set absolute
	    styles. Instead, the keep font or color respectively (This 
	    resolves a long-standing FIXME in the code)
	  - When flushing RTF text, the insert code now considers text trailing
	    behind the insertion point (Fixes the bug where when replacing
	    the selected text via SelectedRTF the remainder of the line behind 
	    the selection would stay on the first insertion line)
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - AppendText now updates the selection points after inserting text
	  - AppendText now ensures that the last tag (sometimes 0-length) of
	    the document is used for the style information (Fixes part of 
	    bug #77220)
	* TextControl.cs:
	  - Created new FontDefiniton class to allow describing partial style
	    changes
	  - StreamLine() now takes a lines argument, to allow it to decide
	    whether an encountered zero-length tag is the last in the document
	    (which must be kept to not loose the font/color contained in it,
	    for later appends)
	  - Created Combine() and Split() methods for Marker structs, to 
	    support marker updates due to reformatted documents (soft line
	    wraps)
	  - Implemented Document.CaretTag setter
	  - Fixed MoveCaret(CtrlEnd) handling, now moves to the last character
	    of the last line (Not the cause, but also exposed by bug #77220)
	  - Added LineTag argument to InsertString method, to allow callers
	    to force a certain tag to be used (required to force use of the
	    trailing zero-length tag of a document)
	  - Now updating markers in Combine(), to avoid stale tag markers
	  - Added some method descriptions to aid maintenance
	  - Implemented new FormatText concept, allowing additive/subtractive
	    formatting by only specifying the components that are to be 
	    changed. This was needed for resolving the RTB.SelectedColor/
	    RTB.SelectedFont fixmes
	  - Added Break() support method to allow breaking up linetags (used
	    for partial formatting)
	  - Added GenerateTextFormat() method. It is used for partial 
	    formatting and allows to generate a full font/color from given
	    attributes and an existing tag.

2006-02-26  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs:  Use the correct caption height.
	- Translate hittest coordinates to screen coords to match MS.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: When we create MDI windows we need to reset
	some of the style flags, so we get a nice blank window, and can
	draw all the decorations ourselves.
	- Set a clipping rectangle on the non client paint event, the
	window manager drawing code needs one.
	* Form.cs: The window manager needs to know when the window state
	has been updated.
	* Hwnd.cs: The window manager stuff now does a proper NCCALC so we
	don't need to factor in border and title sizes in these
	methods. TODO: Remove the args and fix the call points.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Handle NCHITTEST and NCCALCAREA
	properly.
	- Let the driver set the cursors.
	- Improve active window handling
	- Correct sizes for title bars and buttons.
	- Match MS drawing better
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: We don't need to handle border style
	updates specially anymore.
	- Check for scrollbars when windows are done moving
	- Handle Active properly.
	* MimeIcon.cs: Don't crash when we can't load the GNOME stuff
	correctly. I am spewing the exception though, so we don't hide the
	bugs.
	
2006-02-26  Pedro Martinez Julia  <pedromj@gmail.com>

	* DataGridViewRowPostPaintEventArgs.cs,
	  DataGridViewCellPaintingEventArgs.cs,
	  DataGridViewRowCollection.cs,
	  DataGridViewRowPrePaintEventArgs.cs,
	  DataGridViewCell.cs: Clear a few warnings and implement a few
	  exceptions that should be thrown.

2006-02-22  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs (ctor): Explicitly set a cursor to avoid
	  'inheriting' our parent's (non-default) cursor. (Part of
	   the fix for #77479)

2006-02-22  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Fixed cast to make csc happy

2006-02-22  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (WndProc): Only handle WM_SETCURSOR messages if
	  it's for the client area (part of fix for #77479 and needed
	  for MDI window cursor handling)
	* XplatUIX11.cs
	  - DefWindowProc: Now handles the WM_SETCURSOR messages, setting
	    the appropriate default cursors and also passing the message
	    up the parent chain 
	  - GetMessage: Now generating WM_NCHITTEST and WM_SETCURSOR even
	    for non-client areas

2006-02-15  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Since we fake MDI dont tell Windows that this
	is a real MDI window

2006-02-14  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* X11DesktopColors.cs: Instead of checking the desktop session
	  string for "KDE" check if it starts with "KDE"

2006-02-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: These should be unsigned (fixes crash on 32 bit
	systems).

2006-02-10  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Added Refresh to RunDialog to fix some drawing
	  errors
	* ColorDialog.cs:
	  - Got rid of the panel. All controls are now directly added to
	    the dialog form
	  - Changed to mono coding style

2006-02-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* InternalWindowManager.cs: We don't need the set visibility to
	false hack anymore now that peter has written beautiful shutdown
	code.

2006-02-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Ignore DestroyNotify messages for windows that
	  where already explicitly destroyed

2006-02-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Handle the case where windows are too high or to
	the left and we need scrollbars.

2006-02-10  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: Added some icons
	* FileDialog.cs:
	  - Fixed bug #77477
	  - Got rid of the panel. All controls are now directly added to
	    the dialog form
	  - Changed to mono coding style
	  - On Linux "My Computer" and "My Network" will now show some
	    more usefull information. A new class, MasterMount, gathers
	    this information from /proc/mount. Updated MWFFileView to make
	    use of this information
	  - Fixed a bug that caused FileDialog to crash when
	    ".recently_used" file had a zero size
	  - FilterIndex does now what it should
	  - Some Refactoring
	* OpenFileDialog.cs, SaveFileDialog.cs: Updated to reflect latest
	    FileDialog changes

2006-02-09  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Don't touch if null.

2006-02-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Cursor.cs: 64bit safeness fix
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Removed several unneeded and one moronic cast.

2006-02-09  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: If a form is made into an MDI form update the styles so
	all the props can get set correctly.
	- Kill the mdi_container when we dont need it anymore.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Add missing NOT

2006-02-08  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Respek clipping when drawing MDi
	decorations.

2006-02-08  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Hwnd.cs: Add bits to track non client expose events.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Track non client expose events on the hwnd. This
	gives us a proper invalid rect and will allow for some nice
	optimizations with NC client drawing
	- MDI windows are children windows, so move their style handling
	into the child window block.
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Remove a state reset that was
	getting invoked at the wrong time. Fixes managed windows getting
	into a 'stuck' captured state.

2006-02-07  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs (Document.ctor): Now initializing 
	  selection_anchor. Fixes #77493

2006-02-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TrackBar.cs: The increment/decrements were backwards.

2006-02-07  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Theme*.cs : remove ThemeEngine.Current usage as it just points back
	to the instance itself.

2006-02-07  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* X11DesktopColors.cs, ThemeGtk.cs: The GObject structure is based
	  on ulongs and pointers, the size differs between 32bit and 64bit
	  systems. 

2006-02-07  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs : force the WorkingArea away from XGetWindowProperty
	for 64 bit platforms to work around a metacity bug. 

2006-02-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TrackBar.cs: Process the input keys we need, and hookup to
	KeyDown instead of using WndProc, so we get key messages.

2006-02-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Atoms are only 32bit on the wire, no matter what
	  machine we're on. 
	* X11Dnd.cs(SetAllowDrop): Since atoms are always 32bit on the wire
	  we need to translate the XdndVersion atoms array before sending it

2006-02-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: 
	  - The preceeding 64bit fixes had a bug: ChangeProperty expects the
	    number of bits for the property, not the number of bytes. The
	    change to provide IntPtr.Size broke 32bit. (64bit was also wrong
	    but would not crash since it specified 8 bits instead of 4 bits)
	  - More 64bit fixes: Switched all atoms from int to IntPtr (they are
	    defined as XID -> long in the C headers)
	  - Removed 'new IntPtr((int))' and '(IntPtr)' casts from all NetAtoms 
	    references since those are now IntPtr to begin with
	  - Switched all Atom.XXX 'int' casts to IntPtr casts
	  - Fixed XGrabPointer DllImport signature to work for 64bit (cursor arg)
	  - Fixed XInternAtom signature for 64bit, now returns an IntPtr
	  - Added XChangeActivePointerGrab DllImport (for X11DnD)
	* X11Structs.cs:
	  - Changed 'int' type for Atoms in XEvent structures to IntPtr
	  - Changed atom in HoverStruct to be IntPtr
	* X11DnD.cs:
	  - Removed local DllImports, switched code to use those from XplatUIX11
	  - Removed/fixed casts related to the switch of Atom to be a IntPtr

2006-02-06  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs : many more 64 bit pinvoke changes.  I've audited all the 
	method signatures in the import region.  There may still be some
	lingering struct marshaling issues, as I didn't drill down into those.
	Yet.

2006-02-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Dont manually set the top_item, this is computed
	when the scrollbar position is set.

2006-02-06  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs : 64 bit changes to XGetWindowProperty usage. Fixes
	startup crashes on amd64.  There's other fixes needed.  All pinvoke
	usage of Atom needs to be mapped to IntPtr for example.  And there are
	likely other int/long issues to be addressed.

2006-02-04  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: One more...

2006-02-03  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Next try

2006-02-03  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: First part of fix for #77464

2006-02-03  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ButtonBase.cs, ContainerControl.cs, Forms.cs,
	  ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Fix for #77458. Correct handling of
	  AcceptButton border drawing.

2006-02-03  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs: Moved positioning of form after auto scaling is applied,
	  otherwise it would possibly use wrong form size.

2006-02-03  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (RecreateHandle): No need to re-create any child
	  controls, the child windows will get destroyed automatically by
	  the windowing system or driver, and re-created when the handle
	  is being accessed the first time. Fixes #77456
	* Form.cs: No longer setting the form to closing if the handle is 
	  being recreated. This seems like the right thing to do, don't
	  have a bug or testcase for this, though.

2006-02-02  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Suspend/Resume layouting when changing sizes of
	  controls to avoid unwanted side effects

2006-02-02  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: 
	  - ScaleCore needs to scale the bounds, not the ClientSize of the 
	    control. Fixes #77416.
	  - DefaultSize is 0,0 for control
	* TextBoxBase.cs: 
	  - DefaultSize is 100, 20
	  - SetBoundsCore: Now enforcing the height, no matter if the provided
	    height is more or less than the preferred one, as long as AutoSize
	    is on
	* Form.cs: Apply documented fudge factor. Part of item 3 fix for #77416

2006-02-02  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs:
	  - ResumeLayout: Fixed logic when to call PerformLayout, we may not
	    call unless both performLayout is true *and* we have a pending
	    layout change
	  - ResumeLayout: MS does not completely nest Suspend and Resume,
	    they bottom out at 0, fixed our code to match that.
	  - UpdateBounds/SetBoundsCore: Moved calling of UpdateDistances() to
	    SetBoundsCore, we were updating even when we shouldn't. This fixes
	    swf-anchors mis-anchoring when resizing the app fast and lots.
	  - UpdateDistances: Now only setting the left and top distance if 
	    we have a parent and are not suspended, this is based on
	    a suggestion by Don Edvaldson in bug #77355.
	  - OnVisibleChanged: Fixed logic when to create the control. We may
	    not create the control if we have no parent or if it's not visible;
	    switched to using Visible property instead of is_visible field 
	    since the property also considers parent states. This fixes a bug
	    when starting Paint.Net

2006-02-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: If the forms handle hasn't been created yet don't call
	into xplatui to make it top most, just set the topmost flag on the
	form in CreateParams
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Handle WS_EX_TOPMOST.

2006-02-01  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ScrollableControl.cs: Refactored the Recalculate method a
	little, this wasn't handling all the variants of bottom and right
	bars needed to be added and added/removed based on their
	counterparts being added/removed (which changes the drawable
	size). Also we special case client widths and heights of 0 and
	don't add the scrollbar for those.

2006-02-01  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: 
	  - Added method to get AbsoluteGeometry(); currently unused, but might
	    be used in the future, if we try again to figure out toplevel
	    coordinates with some more crappy window managers
	  - Added FrameExtents() method to retrieve the WM set decoration size
	  - Tried to fix up AddConfigureNotify and handling of ReparentNotify 
	    to deal with at least KDE, FVWM and metacity (Fixes #77092)
	* Hwnd.cs: 
	  - Added whacky_wm tracking var for metacity
	  - Added logic to have default menu height if the actual menu height
	    has not yet been calculated (part of fix for #77426)
	* Form.cs: Keep track whether client size has been set and re-set 
	  it if a menu is added/removed afterwards (Fixes #77426)

2006-01-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: When a new Site is set on the component attempt to
	pull the AmbientProperties from it.

2006-01-31  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Menu background is drawn in ColorMenu, not
	  in the background of the owning form. Fixes #77332

2006-01-31  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: Fix for #77409

2006-01-31  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

2006-01-31  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* FixedSizeTextBox: fixes class signature

2006-01-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* FixedSizeTextBox.cs: New internal class that represents a
	textBox that will not be scaled.
	* TreeView.cs:
	* ComboBox.cs:
	* UpDownBase.cs: Use the new FixedSizeTextBox instead of a
	standard TextBox.
		
2006-01-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Retrieve default screen number instead of
	  assuming 0. Attempted fix for #77318

2006-01-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: 
	  - GetWindowPos: When a window is parented by FosterParent, use 
	    the desktop instead of FosterParent as the base to get coordinates
	  - CreateWindow: Don't make FosterParent the parent window for Popups
	    if we don't want a taskbar entry, Popups automatically don't get one
	* Hwnd.cs: Need to call remove to actually remove the key from the
	  hash table

2006-01-30  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: adjust MainMenu item popup location to y=0.

2006-01-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs:
	* TreeNode.cs: Raise events no matter how the treenode is
	checked. Patch by Don Edvalson.

2006-01-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Signature fix.

2006-01-29  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs: Fixed a crash in ProgressBar drawing.

2006-01-20  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: Add ActiveTracker property to do Captures and perform mouse
	event forwarding when menus are active.
	* MenuAPI.cs: kill the GrabControl hack.  Use Form.ActiveTracker.
	Most of the patch is pdb's with a little rework.

2006-01-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs: 
	  Removed GetMenuDC and ReleaseMenuDC methods; replaced
	  by PaintEventStart(handle, false) and PaintEventEnd(handle, false)
	* Form.cs: Changed WM_NCPAINT handler to use PaintEventStart and End
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Added use of PaintEventStart/End to
	  handling of WM_NCPAINT message, now passing the PaintEventArgs to
	  the PaintWindowDecorations method
	* MainMenu.cs: Switched logic from GetMenuDC to PaintEventStart
	* MdiChildContext.cs: Switched logic from GetMenuDC to PaintEventStart
	* MenuAPI.cs: Made tracker window invisible
	* XplatUIWin32.cs:
	  - Removed GetMenuDC and ReleaseMenuDC methods
	  - Implemented the client=false path for PaintEventStart and
	    PaintEventEnd

2006-01-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs(SetBorderStyle): Fixed3D needs a border
	* XplatUIX11.cs(DeriveWindowStyles): Updated to match fixed Form
	  styles
	* Form.cs: 
	  - MaximizeBox, MinimizeBox: Recreate the handle when setting
	    the style
	  - CreateParams: Reworked the styles to match MS look'n'feel,
	    removed automatic setting of MinimizeBox, MaximizeBox, etc. via
	    the WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW style. This fixes #76823.

2006-01-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs(GetWindowState): Now throwing an exception when the 
	  window is not mapped, since otherwise every form that's being 
	  created is considered minimized, which is wrong.
	* Form.cs: Catching the exception and returning our internal value
	  instead

2006-01-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs: Added new driver method
	  SetWindowMinMax() to have means to tell the driver about the minimum,
	  maximum and maximized state window sizes. (Part of the fix for #76485)
	* Form.cs:
	  - Implemented tracking of minimum and maximum window size, now calling
	    new SetWindowMinMax() driver method to tell the driver (Part of the
	    fix for #76485)
	  - Finished handling of WM_GETMINMAXINFO method, now setting all values
	    (Completes fix for #76485)
	  - Calling new SetWindowMinMax driver method when the handle for a 
	    form is created, to make sure the driver knows about it even if
	    the values have been set before the window was created
	  - Now eating the WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED message if the form is minimized
	    to avoid messing up our anchoring calculations (partial fix
	    for #77355)
	* XplatUIStructs.cs: Added MINMAXINFO struct (moved from Win32 driver)
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Added _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN property for detecting minimized state
	  - Improved GetWindowState() to detect 'Minimized' state on Metacity 
	    (and presumably other freedesktop.org compliant WMs). Left the
	    assumption unmapped=minimized, needed for SetVisible to work.
	  - Now setting the window state when creating windows
	  - Fixed SetVisible to consider/set the window state when mapping
	    a Form. We cannot set the state before it's mapped, and we cannot
	    use Form.WindowState once it's mapped (since it would ask the
	    driver and get 'normal'. Therefore, we grab the state before
	    mapping, map, and then set state.
	  - Implmemented SetWindowMinMax method; Metacity does not seem to
	    honor the ZoomHints, though.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs:
	  - Removed MINMAXINFO (moved to XplatUIStructs)
	  - Added SetWindowMinMax stub (on Win32 the only way to set that
	    information is in response to the WM_GETMINMAXINFO message, which
	    is handled in Form.cs)
	  - Added logic to SetVisible to set the proper window state when a 
	    form is made visible (fixes #75720)

2006-01-26  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (BeginInvoke): Automagically handle EventHandlers the
	same way we handle them with Invoke.

2006-01-25  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs:
	  - Added tracking of window state so CreateParams can return
	    the appropriate style
	  - Moved setting of WS_CAPTION style in CreateParams to allow
	    styles without caption
	* DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs: We are now also creating the TextBox 
	  control if the TextBox property is accessed. Fixes #77345
	* Control.cs:
	  - get_Created: now uses is_disposed and is_created to determine
	    return value (suggested by Jackson)
	  - CreateHandle: No longer exits if the handle is being recreated
	  - RecreateHandle: If the handle is not yet created call the 
	    appropriate method to create either control or handle. If the
	    control is already created CreateHandle will simply exit instead
	    of just creating the handle
	* Hwnd.cs: Removed expose_pending tracking, no longer needed since we
	  now SendMessage WM_DESTROY directly to the control when DestroyWindow
	  is called.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: 
	  - When DestroyWindow is called, instead of waiting for the 
	    DestroyNotification from X11, we directly post it to the WndProc
	    and immediately dispose the hwnd object.
	    Same applies to DestroyChildWindows, and this obsoletes the
	    expose_pending tracking. Contrary to Win32 behaviour we destroy our
	    child windows before our own, to avoid X11 errors.
	  - Removed the direct sending of WM_PAINT on UpdateWindow
	* XplatUIWin32.cs:
	  - Reworked DoEvents and GetMessage to allow access to internal queue
	    even when trying non-blocking access to the queue.  Fixes #77335. 
	    Based on a patch suggestion by Don Edvalson. The new private
	    GetMessage can now also be used as a backend for a PeekMessage
	    frontend version.
	* XplatUI.cs: Improved debug output for CreateWindow

2006-01-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Help.cs: Allow param to be null. Patch by Don Edvalson.

2006-01-24  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Clamp the max value set for the vertical scrollbar
	when we have a MaxDropItems lower then the selected index.

2006-01-24  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Don't allow selection of non visible controls, allow
	selection of controls without parents.

2006-01-24  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* DataGridDrawingLogic.cs: Add editing row only when is necessary

2006-01-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* UpDownBase.cs: Make the textbox handle all the selection and
	tabbing. This fixes tabing to updown controls.

2006-01-24  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: fixes exception thown the object was null

2006-01-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ButtonBase.cs: Just use the base CreateParams. They set
	visibility and enabled correctly.
	* ComboBox.cs:
	* TrackBar.cs:
	* MonthCalendar.cs: Lets let the base set as much of the
	createparams as possible so we don't have duplicate code all over
	the place.

2006-01-22  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeGtk.cs: Added TrackBar and some experimental code to
	  get double buffering back

2006-01-21  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: Allows row number set internally higher than the last
	when creating a new row. Restores the editing functionality.

2006-01-20  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: delay Image creation until the icons are accessed
	instead of creating 190 scaled images on GnomeHandler startup.

2006-01-19  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextBoxBase.cs (WndProc): When handling WM_KEYDOWN we need to
	  first call base before processing the event. Fixes #77279

2006-01-19  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs, Cursor.cs: Fixed code that wrongly assumed
	  that the stride for the GDI bitmap would match the stride of
	  a DIB or a Cursor.

2006-01-19  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeGtk.cs: Added ProgressBar, RadioButton, CheckBox

2006-01-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Hookup the text controls keydown event so we get
	those when the text control has the focus.

2006-01-18  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Label.cs: Now using the base events instead of defining new ones;
	  this allows us to just call the base properties without having to
	  duplicate all base property logic 

2006-01-18  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Label.cs: A label by default is not a tabstop (Fixes one of our
	  failing nunit tests)

2006-01-18  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Fixed wrong DoEvents logic. Fixes #77282
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Removed WM_PAINT check from DoEvents. Fixes #77282

2006-01-18  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Cursor.cs: Reimplemented creating cursor bitmaps without using
	  the Bitmap(Stream) constructor which is semi-broken on MS GDI+.
	  This fixes #77218
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: 
	  - Reimplemented creating Bitmaps from DIBs since the Bitmap(Stream) 
	    constructor creates images that can't be saved. Part of the fix
	    for #76103
	  - Added handling of CF_BITMAP as CF_DIB to clipboard code (Fixes #76103)
	  - SetWindowState: Switched ShowWindow flags (part of an upcoming 
	    bug fix for handling window state in forms properly)

2006-01-18  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeGtk.cs: Simplify ScrollBar drawing

2006-01-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Splitter.cs: Set the default dock style for the splitter control
	in the constructor.

2006-01-18  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeGtk.cs: Corrected StateType and ShadowType for
	  gtk_paint_box

2006-01-18  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* Control.cs: Make use of Theme.DoubleBufferingSupported
	* ThemeGtk.cs:
	  - Added drawing for flat style buttons
	  - Added ScrollBar drawing

2006-01-18  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs: Removed some unneeded code.
	* ThemeGtk.cs: First part of ThemeGtk enhancements.

2006-01-17  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* LinkLabel.cs: We need to update the hover drawing when
	  leaving the control as well.

2006-01-18  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: Clicking on non empty areas in the columns
	   area was giving an exception

2006-01-17  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	* ListView.cs: Do not draw/clip the headers when the header style
	is None.

2006-01-17  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: Fixes 77260
	
2006-01-17  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: Clicking on a column on a empty grid was giving
	  an exception

2006-01-17  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* DataGrid.cs (OnKeyDown): Don't use the array if it's empty
	  or any keypress will crash the grid.

2006-01-17  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MainMenu.cs (OnMenuChanged): set Height=0 to cause relayout.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs (CalcItemSize): clear Height/Width for 
	invisible/previously-visible items.
	[Fixes #76909]

2006-01-17  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs:
	- Added CL_Draw_Button method; now other theme controls that are 
	  not derived from button or do not have a button can draw buttons
	  too
	- Updated ComboBox drawing
	- Beautified RadioButton drawing
	- Corrected drawing of bottom and left tabs
	- Beautified DateTimePicker and MonthCalendar
	- Added CPDrawButton and CPDrawRadioButton

2006-01-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Set the initial value of the scrollbar to the
	current index. Reduce the numbers of refreshs and IndexOfs called.

2006-01-14  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: When the file listview is focused hitting the
	  backspace key moves the fileview to the parent directory

2006-01-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Form.cs: 
	  - Added RecreateHandle call when changing taskbar visibility to 
	    trigger reparenting in Win32 driver (Fixes #75719)
	  - If a window has minimize or maximize buttons, it cannot have
	    a help button
	* XplatUIWin32.cs:
	  - CreateWindow: When no WS_EX_APPWINDOW style is found we parent
	    the toplevel form with FosterParent (A toolwindow not on the
	    taskbar) (Fixes #75719)
	  - Made FosterParent a toolwindow

2006-01-13  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Don't crash if InitialDirectory doesn't exist

2006-01-13  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ToolTip.cs: If SetToolTip is called from a control and the mouse
	  is currently over that control, make sure that tooltip_window.Text
	  gets updated

2006-01-13  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: size_t on lp64 fix for gdk_pixbuf_save_to_file extern.

2006-01-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: On MS GetNodeAt never actually factors in the X
	value passed.  Also redraw the selected node when we recieve
	focus, so tabbing between trees works correctly.

2006-01-13  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: GnomeHandler: older gnome versions don't have
	  ~/.gconf/%gconf-tree.xml, so use
	  .gconf/desktop/gnome/interface/%gconf.xml

2006-01-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextControl.cs: Draw text in gray if control is disabled

2006-01-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TreeView.cs: Draw the focus rectangle outside the highlight, to
	  make sure it's always visible. Fixes #76680.

2006-01-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Implemented Wheel scrolling. Fixes #76531

2006-01-13  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* PageSetupDialog.cs: Added.
	* PrintDialog.cs: Attributes.
	* PrintPreviewControl.cs: Updates.
	* PrintPreviewDialog.cs: Updates.
	
2006-01-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Undid my selection check fix, since it's not needed
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Now considering the presence of hscroll/vscroll when sizing
	    vscroll/hscroll respectively. Fixed bug #77077
	  - Added Left/Up/Down/Right to IsInputKey list to prevent
	    ContainerControl from stealing them. This fixes what I broke
	    with my last checkin.

2006-01-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* ScrollableControl.cs: Implemented dockpadding. Fixes #77166. And
	  I finally understand how the property can be set without a setter :-)

2006-01-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Application.cs:
	  - Switched RunLoop to use static Message.Create to create a 
	    Message object
	  - Added PreProcessMessage call in runloop for keyboard events; this
	    is part of the fix for #77219, I overlooked this originally in the
	    MSDN doc for PreProcessMessage
	* Control.cs:
	  - Removed call to PreProcessMessage from handling of keyboard 
	    messages; it's supposed to be done in the message pump
	  - Moved call to ProcessKeyEventArgs inside ProcessKeyMessage as
	    per MSDN documentation.
	  - IsInputChar: All chars are input chars by default; removed the 
	    parent calling chain, MS does not document that
	  - PreProcessMessage: If IsInputChar is true, we want to return false
	    to allow dispatching of the message
	  - When selecting the next control, now also check that we're not
	    selecting ourselves again and therefore return a false positive.
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Tried to match return values for IsInputKey and ProcessDialogKey
	    to what MS returns; moved processing of our special keys outside
	    ProcessDialogKey since MS does not seem to return true on those.
	  - Moved code that previously was in ProcessDialogKey into new private
	    ProcessKey method, which gets called upon receipt of WM_KEYDOWN
	  - Reworked handling of WM_CHAR to not have to duplicate code from
	    Control.cs anymore, instead we simply call down to base.
	   
2006-01-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: We always need to refresh the text area when
	EndUpdate is called. Fixes the combobox in the file dialog.
	* Control.cs: Don't create the creator_thread until the controls
	handle is created.  Also in InvokeRequired we check if the
	creator_thread is null. This gives the effect of InvokeRequired
	returning true if the controls handle is not created yet, and
	matches MS.

2006-01-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs:
	  - Added StartLoop() driver method. This is used to allow drivers to
	    prepare for an upcoming GetMessage/TranslateMessage/DispatchMessage
	    loop for a particular thread
	  - Added EndLoop() driver method. This is called once the message
	    pump for the thread is shut down
	  - Added SupportsTransparency method to allow the driver to indicate
	    opacity support for windows
	* Form.cs:
	  - Removed TODO attribute, completed AllowTransparency property
	  - Added documented logic to Opacity
	* GroupBox.cs, Label.cs, LinkLabel.cs, PropertyGrid.cs, Control.cs,
	  ButtonBase.cs, CheckedListBox.cs: Combined Jackson's and Miguel's
	  versions of CompatibleTextRendering
	* X11Structs.cs: Added opacity atom to our atom enumeration
	* Hwnd.cs: Added opacity tracking (we need to track since the opacity
	  of a form might be set before it's reparented by the WM, and we need
	  the opacity value without calling up to Form)
	* XplatUIDriver.cs: Added StartLoop(), EndLoop() and 
	  SupportsTransparency() driver methods
	* Application.cs: Now calling StartLoop and EndLoop driver methods
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Added opacity atom registration
	  - Added StartLoop()/EndLoop() methods. They're empty right now but
	    will need to get implemented when we switch to a per-thread queue
	  - Implemented SupportsTransparency() method
	  - Implemented SetWindowTransparency() method
	  - Added support for setting the opacity value when a window is
	    reparented (since the opacity needs to be set on the WM frame)
	* XplatUIOSX.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs:
	  - Added SupportsTransparency(), StartLoop() and EndLoop() methods

2006-01-12  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs: Don't crash if TabControl.Parent is null.

2006-01-12  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Added ToolTip for MWFFileView
	* MimeIcon.cs: Rewrote GnomeHandler.
	  - Get currently used gnome icon theme from
	    ($HOME)/.gconf/%gconf-tree.xml
	  - Make use of inherited icon themes
	  - Support SVG icon themes like Tango via librsvg

2006-01-12  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	Revert's Jackson's revert which broke 2.0 builds.   Fix both
	builds. 
	
	* Application.cs: Move the use_compatible_text_rendering outside
	the NET_2_0 define.  If we ever need to use the
	use_compatible_text_rendering on the individual controls they will
	access the variable from the common shared code paths.

2006-01-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs:
	  - Added more granular debug options
	  - Added method to print both window text and id
	  - Switched debug output to use new Window() debug method
	  - Added IsEnabled() driver method
	  - Added EnableWindow() driver method
	* Form.cs:
	  - Removed end_modal; no longer needed, new loop handles termination
	    via 'closing' variable
	  - If form is modal, setting DialogResult will now initiate loop
	    termination via 'closing' variable
	  - Added support for is_enabled/WS_DISABLED to CreateParams
	  - Close() now just send the WM_CLOSE message; the WM_CLOSE handler
	    does all the work
	  - Removed code that's now in RunLoop from ShowDialog()
	  - Added various documented sanity checks to ShowDialog()
	  - Added handling of WM_DESTROY message; we set 'closing' on getting
	    the message to indicate the message pump to terminate
	  - Added handling of new internal WM_CLOSE_INTERNAL message - it's
	    send by the Application.ExitThread method. (We send the message
	    to destroy the window after all other events have been
	    processed through the queue, instead of destroying the handle 
	    directly)
	  - Moved code from Close() method to WM_CLOSE handler; added logic
	    to only send close-related events if the form is not displayed
	    modal
	* Splitter.cs (..ctor): Fixed typo in resource name
	* Control.cs:
	  - DrawBackgroundImage: Explicitly selecting the wrap mode for the
	    brush now
	  - set_Cursor: Now only setting calling into XplatUI if the handle for
	    the control is already created; this avoids implict handle creation
	    or crashes if it's not created
	  - set_Enabled: Now setting the enabled state via the new driver method
	    instead of just tracking it
	  - CreateParams: Added logic to set WS_DISABLED based on enabled state
	  - CreateControl: Reordered event firing and method calls to more
	    closely fire events in the order MS does. Now setting the
	    enabled state in the driver when creating the control.
	  - SetVisibleCore: Moved when the OnVisibleChanged event is fired to
	    match MS order
	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs, MessageBox.cs, ButtonBase.cs, TrackBar.cs,
	  MonthCalendar.cs: get_CreateParams: Added setting of WS_DISABLED 
	* XplatUIStructs.cs: Added internal WM_CLOSE_INTERNAL mesage id
	* Hwnd.cs:
	  - Added tracking of window enabled state (get_Enabled/set_Enabled)
	  - Added EnabledHwnd property to easily allow a driver to find the
	    handle of the first enabled window in the parent chain (this is
	    used by drivers to pass up input events of disabled windows)
	* XplatUIDriver.cs: Added IsEnabled() method
	* Application.cs:
	  - Removed crude and obsolete exiting tracking variable
	  - Removed internal ModalRun(); replaced by RunLoop()
	  - Implemented private CloseForms() method to allow closing all 
	    windows owned by a particular (or all) threads
	  - Exit() now properly closes all windows without forcing the message
	    pump to quit
	  - Removed obsolete InternalExit() method
	  - Changed Run() methods to use new RunLoop() message pump
	  - Implemented new RunLoop() method for both modal and non-modal forms
	* CommonDialog.cs:
	  - get_CreateParams: Added setting of WS_DISABLED
	  - Simplified ShowDialog(); now all the work is done in RunLoop(),
	    invoked via Form.ShowDialog()
	* NativeWindow.cs: We don't remove the window from the collection when
	  the handle is destroyed; there might still be messages for it in the
	  queue (mainly the resulting WM_DESTROY); instead it will be removed
	  when Control calls InvalidateHandle in the WM_DESTROY handler
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - CreateWindow: Added logic to handle the WS_DISABLED window style
	  - EnableWindow: Implemented based on Hwnd.Enabled
	  - GetMessage: Reset PostQuitState so the method can be called again
	  - Implemented support for disabled windows (passing messages to the
	    first enabled parent) in handling all input messages
	  - Added optimizations for handling Expose events
	  - Implemeted new driver method IsEnabled()
	  - Now always resetting paint pending tracking vars when we start paint
	  - Re-implemented UpdateWindow via just sending a WM_PAINT message
	* XplatUIOSX.cs: Added IsEnabled method stub
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Implemented new IsEnabled() method

2006-01-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ButtonBase.cs, CheckedListBox.cs, GroupBox.cs, Label.cs,
	LinkLabel.cs, PropertyGrid.cs: Unbreak 1.1 build. Consolidate the
	variables a little.
	* ColorDialog.cs: Clear out the old form before adding the new
	panel.	

2006-01-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Make sure to add all the text formats when adding
	strings to the data object.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: When adding to a sorted tree we need to
	do some redrawing too.  Also change the UpdateNode to an
	UpdateBelow so the newly added node gets painted.
	
2006-01-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* ButtonBase.cs, CheckedListBox.cs, GroupBox.cs, Label.cs,
	LinkLabel.cs, PropertyGrid.cs: Implement the
	UseCompatibleTextRendering property for 2.x

	* Application.cs (SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault): Add. 

2006-01-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Use the property for setting the selected node so
	the correct events get raised.
	* TreeNode.cs: Update the tree when the fore/back colours of a
	node are set.

2006-01-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Allow setting SelectedNode to null.

2006-01-9  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* Form.cs: Fix support for Form TransparencyKey and Opacity on Windows.

2006-01-9  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* PrintControllerWithStatusDialog.cs: Update page number in dialog.

2006-01-9  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* PrintDialog.cs: Added attributes and set default property values.

2006-01-9  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* PrintControllerWithStatusDialog.cs: 
	Added PrintControllerWithStatusDialog.

2006-01-9  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* XplatUI.cs, Form.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs, 
	XplatUIWin32.cs: Added support for Form TransparencyKey and Opacity on Windows.

2006-01-9  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Fix crash when there is no selected item (due to last commit)

2006-01-09  Jonathan Chambers  <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Added KeyDown event handler for processing arrow keys
	and PgUp/PgDown. Also, scroll to selected item upon dropdown. Bugs 76857 and 76788.

2006-01-08  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: Added internal class SVGUtil.

2006-01-08  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Don't crash if there are two files with the
	  same name but different locations.

2006-01-08  John BouAntoun  <jba-mono@optusnet.com.au>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: Fixed annoying rendering bug when selecting
	dates across multiple month grids. Used to not highlight entire 
	month, but does now.
	
2006-01-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: Removed DoEvents call to prevent a running
	message loop. Change timer intervals to numbers that seem more
	natural.

2006-01-06  John BouAntoun  <jba-mono@optusnet.com.au>

	* DateTimePicker.cs: Modified CalculateDropDownLocation to use the screen
	  object for location info since screen object is now implemented.

2006-01-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* AsyncMethodData.cs: Check if the call is complete before doing a WaitOne
	* AsyncMethodResult.cs: We no longer use a WeakReference for the
	AsyncMethodResult, this is because we ALWAYS want the
	ManualResetEvent to get set.
	* Control.cs: When disposing use an async invoke to call shutdown
	code, so that thigns don't block on the finalizer thread.  Also
	check if we even have a message loop before trying to send
	messages, if we don't then don't bother sending messages.
	- No more weak references for async methods
	* XplatUIDriver.cs: No more weak references for async methods.

2006-01-04  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FontDialog.cs: Fix, don't throw an exception if FontFamily.Families
	  returns two FontFamily with the same name

2006-01-04  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs, ThemeClearlooks.cs: Dropped stupid scheme of 
	  drawing disabled text. Instead using the ColorGrayText color

2006-01-04  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: redraw the node when its image index is changed.

2006-01-04  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: Same fix as last, just for SelectionColor. This
	  time I checked there are no others like it.

2006-01-04  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* AsyncMethodResult.cs: Use a ManualResetEvent instead of a mutex,
	this gives the behavoir I was looking for.
	* Control.cs: Special case Invoking EventHandlers, this matches MS
	and fixes part of bug #76326.

2006-01-04  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs, FileDialog.cs:
	  - Reflect the latest Theme class changes
	  - Remove Mono.Unix.Syscall.time in FileDialg and replace it 
	    with DateTime
	    
2006-01-04  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* Theme.cs: Cache UI resource images and resize them if needed

2006-01-03  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: FormatText is 1-based, make it so when SelectionFont
	  is called. This fixes the crash in Nexxia when setting the font
	  attributes in the chat. [However, RTF needs a look-over to make sure
	  that all SelectionXXX methods handle the special case that selection
	  is empty and therefore the change must be applied to all text starting
	  at the cursor/selection start]

2006-01-03  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs,
	  XplatUIOSX.cs: Added SendMessage and PostMessage methods
	* X11Keyboard.cs: Switched to new way of calling PostMessage

2006-01-03  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Theme.cs: Added theme interface for images to allow the theme to
	  control what images are used for things like FileDialog, MessageBox
	  icons, etc.
	* MessageBox.cs: Now uses the new Theme icon/image interfaces

2006-01-03  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs:
	  - Removed some dead code
	  - Opening a recently used file does work now
	  - Small UI enhancements
	  - Refactoring

2006-01-02  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Forgot too add __MonoCS__

2006-01-02  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: We are able to read recently used files now let's
	  go on and write them.

2006-01-01  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Breathe some life into "last open"/"recently used"
	  button
	* MimeIcon.cs: Do a check for the top level media type also

2005-12-31  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs:
	  - Added CPDrawStringDisabled
	  - ButtonBase_DrawText: Workaround for a DrawString bug; cut off
	    some chars if the text doesn't fit into text_rect
	  - DrawListViewItem: If View = View.LargeIcon center the image;
	    rewrote the drawing of ListViewItem.Text if View = 
	    View.LargeIcon

2005-12-31  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* MimeIcon.cs: Use default KDE icon theme if there is no
	  "48x48" directory for the current icon theme, fixes #77114
	* Mime.cs: Disable not working and actually not used code. 
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	  - Replace "new SolidBrush" in GetControlBackBrush and
	    GetControlForeBrush with ResPool.GetSolidBrush
	  - Changed DrawListViewItem from private to protected virtual
	* FileDialog.cs:
	  - Added form.MaximizeBox = true
	  - Don't throw an exception if there is a broken symbolic link

2005-12-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Give the panels focus, keyboard navigation is
	fixed so this works correctly now.
	- We need these key events also.
	* ToolBar.cs: Remove some of the poor mans double buffering.
	
2005-12-24  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: The internal TextBox now returns the focus.

2005-12-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:  Draw the text for all tab appearances.

2005-12-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Removed debug code
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Changed DestroyChildWindows to also consider
	  implicit children

2005-12-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: When creating the control, update the Z-order after
	  all it's children are created, too. (Fixes nexxia not showing
	  picturebox bug)

2005-12-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Do not update the anchoring distances if layout is
	  suspended, instead do it once layout is resumed

2005-12-22  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: 
	  - After many hours of debugging, for both Jackson and
	    myself, it turns out that it helps to set the parent of a control
	    if you want to actually see it onscreen. In the spirit of that
	    discovery, we're now setting the parent of the control and
	    it's children when the control's handle is created. This fix
	    will make Lutz Roeder's Reflector run happily. 
	  - now just creating the handle instead of the whole control when
	    getting a graphics context for the control.

2005-12-22  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ScrollableControl.cs: When calculating the canvas, don't consider
	  the scrollbar widths. Instead, predict if horizontal scrollbar
	  will affect canvas when deciding on vertical display and vice versa.

2005-12-22  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs: Set default RTF font for documents that don't
	  have a font table (Fixes #77076)

2005-12-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: It's difficult to do, but you can have an empty
	clipboard. This prevents a NullRef in that case.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Use CLIPBOARD not PRIMARY for our
	clipboard. PRIMARY is for the currently selected text only. (We
	should implement PRIMARY at some point.

2005-12-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Fixed the TEXTMETRIC structure, we were calling
	  a Unicode function with a structure that was defined in Ansi way.
	  This fixes #76942.

2005-12-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* StatusBar.cs: Statusbar handles its fore/back colours on it's
	on. Because thats how it rolls. (and this avoids it using ambient
	colours).
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Use the proper back color for filling.
	* Menu.cs: Use the system menu bar color for drawing menu
	bars. Using the window back color will bring ambient colours into
	the picture.

2005-12-21  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ColorDialog.cs: Fixed a memory leak that caused a SIGSEV. A lot of
	  Bitmaps were created and not disposed.

2005-12-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (CreateControl): Don't do anything if the control is
	  already created, otherwise we'd fire the OnCreated event more than
	  once

2005-12-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* ComboBox.cs (FindStringCaseInsensitive): Don't search for emtpy strings,
	  will always match. Instead return -1. Fixes #76464.

2005-12-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs (RecalculateLine): Only wrap if the wrap point is
	  neither the beginning nor the end of the line (Fixes bug #76479)

2005-12-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs:
	  - ControlNativeWindow.ControlFromHandle(): Now handling situation
	    where handle is invalid
	  - FromHandle(): Now using hashtable-based ControlFromHandle() lookup
	    instead of slower linear search
	* NativeWindow.cs: Don't remove the window from the hashtable until
	  after the driver has destroyed it (since the driver might use
	  Control.FromHandle to lookup the control object
	* Hwnd.cs: Added DestroyPending property to track if a window is 
	  already destroyed as far as the driver is concerned and only hasn't
	  yet notified the control
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Activate(): Check if the window is still valid before using the 
	    handle
	  - Implemented DestroyChildWindow() method to mark child windows as
	    destroyed when a window is destroyed. This prevents situations 
	    where we might call an X method based on queued events for a
	    window that already has been destroyed but we haven't yet pulled
	    the destroy method from the queue.
	  - Added a call to the new DestroyChildWindow() method to the drivers
	    DestroyWindow code. Also now marking the destroyed window itself
	    as pending

2005-12-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* StatusBar.cs:
	* StatusBarPanel.cs: Don't calculate panel sizes on draw
	anymore. Just do them when needed, also track the rects of panels
	so that we can optimize refreshing more in the future.

2005-12-20  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ColorDialog.cs: Fixed focus drawing in small color controls

2005-12-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* InternalWindowManager.cs:
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: Cleanup some coordinate system changes so
	moving windows works properly.

2005-12-19  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: 
	  - Removed call to InitLayout() from SetBoundsCore(); doc says
	    it's only called when a control is added to a container
	  - Split InitLayout logic, moved to separate UpdateDistances() method
	    since we need to perform those calculations more often than just
	    when adding the control to a container. (Needed to fix #77022)
	  - Now calling UpdateDistances() from UpdateBounds() (fixes #77022)
	  - Reduced the OnBindingContextChanged events count, don't send them
	    unless the control is created, we still aren't totally matching
	    MS, but I can't quite figure out some of their rules

2005-12-18  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs: Corrected distance between ProgressBar
	  stripes

2005-12-18  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs:
	  - Updated ProgressBar drawing
	  - Corrected drawing of ScrollBars and scroll buttons
	  - Some temporary fixes for minor pixel artefacts

2005-12-18  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs:
	  - Reworked Controls.Add(), Controls.Remove() and set_Parent() to
	    cause events to be sent in the same order as MS does.
	  - Added ChangeParent() method to trigger various OnXXXChanged events
	    that need to be fired when a parent changes (This is a reworking
	    of the patch from r54254, with the X11 errors fixed)
	  - Removed SuspendLayout()/ResumeLayout() calls from Controls.Clear()
	    since on MS we get OnLayoutChanged events when calling Clear()
	  - Changed Enabled property to consider parent state as well, if a
	    parent is not enabled, the control will not be either
	  - Changed Parent property to simply call Controls.Add() since that
	    now does all the work required, this way we avoid code duplication
	  - Threw in a few OnBindingsContextChanged calls to try and match
	    when MS sends them. We seem to send a few too many, though.
	  - Added call to CreateControl when adding the control to a parent.
	    We were never calling CreateControl. Still needs some work, in
	    some places we treat HandleCreated and ControlCreated as equal, 
	    which is wrong
	  - Removed obsolete commented out code from UpdateZOrder()

2005-12-18  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs: Updated TrackBar drawing.

2005-12-17  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Patch for #76901 by Atsushi Enomoto

2005-12-17  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Add the Help button and the open readonly
	  checkbox only if needed

2005-12-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Make sure we have an active menu before trying to
	process commands on it. Prevents menu-less forms from crashing
	when Alt is pressed.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Some fixes to prevent null refs. Patch by
	Dieter Bremes.
	* RichTextBox.cs: Expand statement to help out gmcs and fix the
	2.0 build.

2005-12-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* InternalWindowManager.cs: Don't translate tool windows screen
	coordinates. This fixes windows 'bouncing' around when being moved.

2005-12-15  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - MaxLength now treats 2^31-1 equal to unlimited length (this is
	    not quite MS compatible, MS uses that number only for single line
	    and 2^32-1 for multi-line, but I figure it won't hurt keeping
	    the limit at 2GB)
	  - Now enforcing the MaxLength limit when entering characters
	  - Added argument to internal Paste() method to track if it's called
	    from programatically or via keyboard, since keyboard driven pastes
	    need to enforce max-length
	  - Added logic to Paste to only paste as many chars as MaxLength 
	    allows
	* RichTextBox.cs: Updated to use new obey argument for internal Paste()
	* TextControl.cs:
	  - Added Length property to return number of characters in document
	  - Added private CharCount property which only tracks actual chars
	    in the document (no linefeeds) and fires event when CharCount
	    changes
	  - Added tracking of character count to all methods that alter it
	  - Added LengthChanged event to allow applications to subscribe
	    to any changes to the document

2005-12-15  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextBox.cs: 
	  - Removed local password_char field (moved to TextBoxBase)
	  - Now setting the document's password var when password is
	    set
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Added password_char field (needed here so MultiLine can
	    access it)
	  - Added logic to MultiLine property setter to set the document's
	    variable when password display is allowed
	  - Removed debug code and made some debug code conditional
	* TextControl.cs:
	  - Added RecalculatePasswordLine() method to handle special password
	    char only lines
	  - Added PasswordChar property, also added related tracking vars
	  - Draw() method now uses local text var for grabbing text to draw,
	    this var is set to line.text unless we're doing password display,
	    then it is set to the pre-generated all-password-chars line
	  - Added calling RecalculatePasswordLine() method for password lines

2005-12-14  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Hwnd.cs: 
	  - Added Reparented property to allow tracking of Window Manager
	    reparenting actions (which affect X/Y calculations of toplevel 
	    windows)
	  - Made ToString() print window handles in hex
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - AddConfigureNotify(): Now uses reparented state off Hwnd to
	    determine if X/Y needs offsetting
	  - AddConfigureNotify(): Fixed offset calculations
	  - Now adds ReparentNotify messages into the queue
	  - Now processes ReparentNotify messages and causes a 
	    WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED message to be sent upstream if a window
	    is reparented (as most likely it's X/Y coordinates are changed
	    due to that)

2005-12-14  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Tool windows still need to respek focus.

2005-12-14  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: Undid 54254 (causing XConfigure errors) so we can
	  have a working release

2005-12-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: Update styles after setting the border style regardless
	of whether or not the window is using a window manager.

2005-12-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: We now hook into an internal window manager instead of just an
	MDI subsystem, this is so we can have properly behaving tool windows.
	* MdiClient.cs: Naming change, MdiChildContext is now WindowManager
	* InternalWindowManager.cs: New internal class that acts as a
	window manager for tool windows and as a base for mdi windows.
	* MdiWindowManager.cs: New class that acts as a window manager for
	mdi windows.

2005-12-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Updates so we match behavoir for for implicit
	controls. Fixes explosions in MDI.

2005-12-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Implement Invalidate (Region).

2005-12-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: 
	  - Changed handling of Controls.Add/Controls.Remove to fire (almost) 
	    the same events as MS does. MS fires events for each property 
	    except, for unknown reasons, Cursor, when the control is reparented. 
	    I can't seem to totally match add/remove since MS also fires some 
	    VisibleChanged events, which makes no sense. Consolidated the
	    parenting code into a separate method so it can be called from
	    both Add and Remove. set_Parent no longer needs any special logic
	    as it calls the parent's add method which implicitly fires
	    all events
	  - Removed some obsolete code and debug output
	  - Enabled state is inherited from parents, if this is enabled

2005-12-08  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs: Removed commented out code

2005-12-08  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs:
	  - Added internal version of Invoke, with additional argument 
	    indicating if we're calling it from a Dispose() handler. That
	    way we can avoid BeginInvoke throwing an exception if we're
	    calling for an already destroyed window.
	  - Added a dispose argument to BeginInvokeInternal, and made the
	    check if a valid window handle chain exists conditional on
	    it not being a dispose call
	  - Removed code in DestroyHandle to destroy our children. Since we
	    now handle the WM_DESTROY message we will catch all our children
	    being destroyed.
	  - Now calling OnHandleDestroyed from our new WM_DESTROY handler
	* Form.cs:
	  - Added a field to track the application context of the form.
	  - No need to set closing variable as response to WM_CLOSE, instead
	    we destroy the window. We also call PostQuitMessage if the form
	    has an application context (which makes it the main app form,
	    which, when closed terminates the app)
	* XplatUI.cs:
	  - Dropped Exit() method, it's naming was confusing
	  - Added PostQuitMessage() which causes GetMessage to return false
	    once the message queue is empty
	* XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs: Dropped Exit(), added 
	  PostQuitMessage()
	* XplatUIOSX.cs: Switched signature for Exit method since Exit() is
	  no longer a valid XplatUI method, but left it in since it's used
	  internally. Added empty PostQuitMessage() method.
	* MenuAPI.cs: Replaced call to Exit() with call to
	  PostQuitMessage, even though this is probably no longer needed.
	* Hwnd.cs: Added 'pretty' ToString() to support debugging.
	* X11Structs.cs: Added pretty XEvent.ToString() to support debugging.
	* Application.cs:
	  - Replaced call to XplatUI.Exit() with PostQuitMessage()
	  - Removed old debug code that would call XplatUI for exception
	    display, enabled standard exception handling (Still not enabled
	    though, until NativeWindow's ExternalExceptionHandler define
	    is removed
	* NativeWindow.cs:
	  - Added internal method to allow control to update NativeWindow
	    after a window has been destroyed
	  - Added handling of already destroyed windows when calling i
	    DestroyWindow
	  - Added removal of handle from list on ReleaseHandle
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Dropped GetMessageResult var and related code
	  - Added PostQuitState to field to track if PostQuitMessage has been
	    called
	  - Dropped Exit() method
	  - Added PostQuitMessage() method
	  - GetMessage now will return false if PostQuitState is set and no
	    more messages are in the queue.
	  - Expose handler will no longer generate WM_PAINT messages if we are
	    in PostQuitState since it's very likely any windows have already
	    been destroyed, and since Hwnd won't get updated until we have
	    processed the DestroyNotify we'd be causing X errors.
	
2005-12-07  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs(WndProc): Apparently I'm suffering from brain cloud.
	  Thanks to Mike for pointing out the err of my ways.

2005-12-07  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs(PreProcessMessage): Moved menu handling back, but
	  after all other key handling, to match MS (who handles Menu in
	  DefWndProc)
	* Menu.cs (WndProc): Removed my brainfart

2005-12-07  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs(PreProcessMessage): Removed special menu handling 
	* Menu.cs (WndProc): Added handling of WM_SYSKEYUP for menu purposes.

2005-12-07  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Control.cs : special case SYSKEYUP so that we can adjust keynav
	state according in tracker.
	* Menu.cs : promote tracker field to base class and provide a tracker
	lookup capability.  Add/Remove shortcuts dynamically if the top menu
	has a tracker. Unparent items that are removed from the collection.
	* MenuAPI.cs : implement mnemonic, shortcut, and arrow-based keynav.
	* Theme*.cs: add always_show_hotkeys field to support configurability
	of mnemonic display.  win32 doesn't show mnemonics until Alt is
	pressed.

2005-12-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiChildContext.cs: Use Control.ResetCursor.
	* Control.cs: ResetCursor needs to set the property so that the
	correct XplatUI call gets made.

2005-12-07  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: More fixes to make our key events match MS. We
	  were not setting the modifier state on KeyData, and we were
	  not generating any events when Alt was pressed with a key
	  since handling of WM_SYSxxx was missing for the OnKey methods.

2005-12-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiChildContext.cs: reenable the sizing code.
	- When the mouse leaves a window reset its cursor.

2005-12-07  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs: Reflect latest Hwnd changes

2005-12-07  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Hwnd.cs: Now using the theme 3d bordersize to calculate
	  widths of Fixed3D borders

2005-12-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Fix warnings. Earn Mike's love.

2005-12-07  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs:
	  - Adjusted mouse over button color
	  - Added first parts of CheckBox drawing
	  - Added correct color for selected text background
	  - Fixed ComboBox drawing
	  - Added CPDrawBorder3D and CPDrawBorder

2005-12-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Added call to XBell for AudibleAlert

2005-12-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIX11.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs,
	  XplatUIOSX.cs: Added AudibleAlert() method to have a means to
	  alert users via sound. We could add an enum arg with different
	  types of alerts in the future

2005-12-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Fix behaviour problems pointed out by Mike

2005-12-05  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* StatusBarPanel.cs: add Invalidate method and hook it into all the
	prop setters.  Calls parent.Refresh for now, but could be maybe be
	optimized with an internal method on StatusBar at some point.
	[Fixes #76513]

2005-12-05  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* RichTextBox.cs: Implemented get_SelectionColor

2005-12-05  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs:
	  - Removed dead code
	  - Draw black button border only if button is Form.AcceptButton
	  - Draw correct button color for pressed RadioButton if the mouse 
	    has entered the button
	  - Updated ProgressBar drawing!
	  - Updated CPDrawSizeGrip drawing
	  - Updated StatusBarPanel drawing

2005-12-05  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (PreProcessMessage): add Keys.Alt based on LParam value.
	* X11Keyboard.cs (SendKeyboardInput): formal lParam for alt mod.

2005-12-04  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeClearlooks.cs: Initial check-in, activate with
	  export MONO_THEME=clearlooks
	* ThemeEngine.cs: Added ThemeClearlooks

2005-12-03  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: deactivate menus prior to calling item.PerformClick.
	[Fixes #76897]

2005-12-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: If the child form has no menu the default main menu is
	used as the active menu.

2005-12-02  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* ListBox.cs: Check if any items exist before trying to resolve 
	  coordinates into items

2005-12-02  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Hatchbrush on Win32 seems to always use white
	  as the second color for the background hatch

2005-12-02  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Now uses Jackson's new and improved ImplicitScrollbar
	* RichTextBox.cs: FormatText position arguments are 1-based, now making
	  sure that what we pass to FormatText is always 1-based. Fixes #76885

2005-11-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* NumericUpDown.cs (EndInit): When we are done initializing,
	reflect any updates on the UI.

2005-12-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ImplicitHScrollBar.cs:
	* ImplicitVScrollBar.cs: New scrollbars that don't take focus from
	their container controls.
	* TreeView.cs: Use the new implicit scrollbars.

2005-12-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Make top_node internal so the TreeNodeCollections
	can play with it.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: If we remove the topnode we need to
	update topnode to the next node in line.
	- When clearing nodes go through the same process as removing
	them, so they get depareneted and checked if they are top node.

2005-12-01  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: When imagelists are used the image area is
	selectable as well as the text.
	- If there are no selected nodes select the first one.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Getting the TreeView is mildly expensive,
	so don't do it more then we need to.

2005-12-01  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Reimplement the scroll arrow drawing so
	that arrows can be scaled.

2005-12-01  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNode.cs : Fixed bugs that caused FullPathTest + Traverse to
	fail. Patch by Dieter Bremes

2005-11-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: Property is 2.0 only
	* PrintDialog.cs: Signature fix.

2005-11-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs: 
	  - No longer artificially moves text 2 pixels down (now that we have
	    borders this is no longer needed)
	  - Added calcs for left, hanging and right indent

2005-11-23  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Menu.cs: mark MenuChanged internal, since it's not exposed by MS.

2005-11-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiChildContext.cs: Set the cloned menus forms, as these don't
	get cloned as part of CloneMenu ().
	* Menu.cs: Make sure the parent of the items get set correctly
	when they are added.  And the owners are notified of the changes.
	* Form.cs: Create an ActiveMenu property, so that when MDI is used
	we can change the menu being displayed/handled by the form without
	changing the menu assosciated with the form.
	- Don't let Mdi children draw/handle menus.
	
2005-11-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Menu.cs: Switch the MenuChanged method to OnMenuChanged and add
	a MenuChanged event. Just to make the API a little more
	consistent.
	* MainMenu.cs:
	* MenuItem.cs: Use the new OnMenuChanged
	* MdiChildContext.cs: Handle menu merging.
	* Form.cs: Implement MergedMenu.
	
2005-11-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Menu.cs: We were misusing Add. Add goes behind the specified
	index according to the docs, and does not replace the specified
	index. So I added an Insert method.

2005-11-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs:  Implemented Ctrl-Ins (Copy), Shift-Ins (Paste) and
	  Shift-Del (Cut), apparently Emacs uses these old Win 2.x keys. This
	  is for Jackson
	* RichTextBox.cs: Added calls to base for DnD events

2005-11-28  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs:
	  - Fixed drag-selection related crash; style fixes
	  - Implemented undo class
	    o Implemented method to capture document state for specified
	      range in document tree
	    o Implemented method to restore captured document state
	    o Implemented cursor tracking
	    o Implemented basic undo stack
	  - Added undo cursor tracking to methods altering cursor location
	  - Added undo tracking to selection deletion (still missing
	    other text-altering hookups)
	* RichTextBox.cs:
	  - Added SelectionLength property
	  - Implemented CanPaste()
	  - Implemented Paste()
	  - Added missing protected methods
	  - Fixed RTF->Document conversion; now uses font index 0 and color 
	    index 0 as the default font for the parsed text
	  - Fixed RTF<->Document font size translation
	  - Fixed RTF generation, now properly handles cross-tag boundaries
	    for single line selection
	  - No longer always appends blank line to generated RTF
	  - Removed TODOs
	  - Added missing attributes
	  - Hooked up undo-related methods
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Implemented Copy()
	  - Implemented Paste()
	  - Implemented Cut()
	  - Fixed caret mis-behaviour on backspace across line-boundaries

2005-11-29  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Add a method for activating mdi children. Very
	basic right now. I imagine someday it might need more girth.
	* MenuItem.cs: Implement MDI lists. When mdilist is true the mdi
	children windows names are added to the menu item.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Draw the arrow if the item is an
	mdilist. This happens regardless of whether or not there are any
	mdi windows to see in the list, and according to my tests happens
	before the items are even added. Also happens if there isn't even
	an mdi client to get windows from.

2005-11-29  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Make DrawFlatStyleRadioButton protected
	* ThemeNice.cs: Fix drawing of flatstyle radiobuttons

2005-11-29  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* DataGridTableStyle.cs:
	  - Create always the styles for the missing columns even if they are
	    provided by the user (not default table style)
	* DataGrid.cs:
	  - Fixes bug 76770
	  - Fixes SetDataBinding (always re-attach source)
	  - Fixes SetNewDataSource (only clear styles if they are not for 
	    this source)
	 -  Expands OnTableStylesCollectionChanged to handle style refresh 
	    and remove properly

2005-11-29  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* FileDialog.cs: Implement missing bits, remove some dead
	code.
	* FontDialog.cs: Implement missing Apply stuff, and ToString. Move
	creation of the panel so that the options set on the dialog are
	seen when the panel is created.
	* TreeView.cs: raise a click when items are clicked.
	
2005-11-29  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Pass some signature methods through to base.

2005-11-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ListView.cs: Raise the click event when items are clicked.

2005-11-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Make this algorithm even more beautiful.  And fix
	a nullref.

2005-11-27  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeNice.cs: - Removed 1 pixel bitmaps
	  - Use SmoothingMode.AntiAlias where it makes sense
	    (ScrollButton arrow for example)
	  - Enhanced Button focus drawing
	  - Fixed ComboBox drawing (no artefacts anymore, focus
	    rectangle is back again, reduced size of ComboButton, etc.)
	  - Fixed RadioButton focus drawing for Appearence.Button
	  - Slight ScrollButton redesign
	  - Some LinearGradientBrush size fixes
	  - GroupBoxes have now rounded edges
	  - Fixed StatusBar drawing

2005-11-25  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ThemeNice.cs: - Remove dead code
	  - use correct background colors for menus, etc.
	  - Fake pixel drawing with 1 pixel bitmaps

2005-11-24  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Size the scrollbars when resizing the window.
	- Resize the maximized windows when the client is resized
	* Form.cs: Make the child context available
	
2005-11-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiChildContext.cs: Don't size windows if they are maximized.

2005-11-23  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* ContextMenu.cs: use MenuTracker.
	* Control.cs: remove menu handle usage.
	* Form.cs: remove menu handle usage.
	* Hwnd.cs: remove menu handle usage.
	* MainMenu.cs: Draw method moved here from MenuAPI.DrawMenuBar. Proxy
	motion and clicks to the new Tracker handlers.
	* Menu.cs: add sizing accessors, SelectedItem prop, kill CreateItems
	and handle usage.
	* MenuAPI.cs: refactored to combine popup and menubar event handling.
	Killed the MENU and MENUITEM data types and associated collections
	since we now keep the info on Menu and MenuItem. Expanded TRACKER into
	MenuTracker class that exposes the leftovers from the old MenuAPI
	static methods. Restructured Capture handling so that only one grab is
	done for the entire menu hierarchy instead of handing off grabs to
	submenus. Tracker now has an invisible control to Capture when active.
	* MenuItem.cs: add sizing accessors, kill Create
	and handle usage.
	* Theme.cs: remove menu handle and MENU(ITEM) usage.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: use Menu/MenuItem sizing props instead of
	MENU(ITEM). remove menu handle usage, use Menu directly.
	* XplatUIDriver.cs: remove menu handle usage.
	* XplatUIOSX.cs: remove menu handle usage.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: remove menu handle usage.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: remove menu handle usage.

2005-11-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Hwnd.cs: Don't compute the menu size for
	DefaultClientRectangle.
	- Reenable menu sizes being computed for GetClienRectangle.
	* Form.cs: Remove comment of trechery
	
2005-11-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Hwnd.cs: The adjustments for the menu bar are made when it is
	attached to the form.

2005-11-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Create an HGRN of the invalid area for WM_NCPAINT
	(just like on windows).

2005-11-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiChildContext.cs: Handle all the buttons ourselves. We can't
	use real buttons anymore because they are in non client area. The
	one TODO here is that I need to somehow invalidate a section of
	the non client area.

2005-11-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Put the enum check back in now that MDI doesnt have
	to use this to set border styles.
	* Form.cs: Only set mdi child windows borders if the handle has
	been created.
	* MdiChildContext.cs: Don't set the InternalBorderStyle, just pass
	this directly on to the driver.
	- Get the move start position before adjusting for the titlebar
	height, this fixes the windows "skipping" when they are first
	moved.

2005-11-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Just compute the mdi borders separately as they
	don't totally match up with normal form borders.

2005-11-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Set WS_ styles for borders, so that the driver does
	not have to retrieve the control instance to figure out what kind
	of borders it should have.
	* Form.cs: Set the WS_EX_MDICHILD flag on mdi children, so the
	driver can know its an mdi child easily.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Get the border styles and whether the window is
	MDI from the Styles and ExStyles params instead of having to get a
	control. This prevents a chicken and egg problem.	

2005-11-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Fix typo so scrollbars show up correctly.

2005-11-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: Calculate when to add and remove scrollbars
	correctly.
	* MdiChildContext.cs: Adjust the y position to take the titlebar
	into account.
	- No height for FormBorderStyle.None

2005-11-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Allow non enum values to be used for
	InternalBorderStyle.  MDI does this to set a special border style.
	- New utility methods for converting points to/from client coords
	- Add the newly created control to the Controls collection before
	updating its style. This way UpdateStyle can walk the control
	heirarchy to find the control if needed.
	so I don't need to create a new Point object all the time.
	* Form.cs: Let MDI windows handle their border styles.
	- Set styles on MDI windows so the correct title style is derived.
	* MdiChildContext.cs: Move all the painting and window handling
	into the non client area.
	- Use correct sizing and put correct buttons on frames based on
	the FormBorderStyle.
	- Notify the mdi client about scrolling
	- Need to handle the buttons ourselves now, because they are all
	in non client areas and we can't add controls there.
	* MdiClient.cs: Halfway to scrolling, this implementation is
	somewhat broken though, we need to check to make sure other
	windows aren't causing scrolling before removing the bars. Also
	the bars need to be drawn on top, maybe I can switch implicit
	controls to be on top.
	* Hwnd.cs: caption_height and tool_caption_height are now
	properties of an hwnd, this way they can be set by the driver
	based on the type of window they are.  In X11 the window manager
	handles the decorations so caption_height is zero unless its an
	MDI window.
	- Add 3 pixel borders for MDI windows (0xFFFF).
	- Get rid of some code duplication, have DefaultClientRectanle
	just call GetClientRectangle.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Pass caption_height and tool_caption_height to
	Hwnd now.
	- Set border styles differently for mdi windows.
	* XplatUIOSX.cs: Pass caption_height and tool_caption_height to
	Hwnd now.
	
2005-11-15  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Menu.cs: when adding an item to the collection, if item is already 
	parented, remove it from the parent.

2005-11-13  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* X11DesktopColors.cs: Added KDE support

2005-11-11  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: 
	  - Clipboard methods now can translate Rtf format
	  - No longer removes clipboard contents whenever a new format is added
	    to allow placing multiple formats on the clipboard
	* Clipboard.cs: Clipboard now supports getting a IDataObject and
	  will place all formats contained in it onto the clipboard. Also
	  now cleans the clipboard before placing a new object onto it
	* RichTextBox.cs:
	  - Implemented set_Rtf
	  - Implemented set_SelectedRtf
	  - Created InsertRTFFromStream() method to allow single code base
	    for all properties and methods that insert RTF into document
	  - Removed debug output
	* TextControl.cs:
	  - Fixed Delete(int) to fix up line numbers
	  - Fixed ReplaceSelection to combine start and end line
	  - Fixed serious DeleteChars bug that would leave the document tree
	    broken
	  - Improved DumpTree with several logic checks to detect broken
	    document trees
	  - Removed debug lines
	  - Fixed Caret.WordForward/WordBack moving code, now always also 
	    updates caret.tag (fixes crash when word-selecting across tag
	    boundaries via keyboard)
	  - Added Insert() method for inserting multiline text into documents
	  - Fixed DeleteChars() calculation errors that would cause a broken
	    tag chain with multiple tag lines
	  - DeleteChars() no longer crashes on multi-tag lines if not all tags
	  - Split() no longer moves caret if split is at caret location
	  - ReplaceSelection() now updates the cursor and re-displays it
	  - ReplaceSelection() now uses new Insert() method to avoid code
	    duplication
	  - FormatText() can now handle formatting partial lines
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Append now uses new TextControl.Insert() method (this avoids 
	    duplicate code)
	  - Implemented Ctrl-X (Cut) (
	  - Implemented Ctrl-C (Copy)
	  - Implemented Ctrl-V (Paste) (Still some bugs related to screen 
	    regeneration when pasting text; roundtripping Copy&Paste within
	    edit control still fails due to some calculation bugs in GenerateRTF)
	  - The Delete key will now remove the current selection if it is visible
	* TextBox.cs: Removed debug lines
	* XplatUI.cs: Trigger initialization of DataFormats (which requires the
	  driver to be initialized and can't therefore be done via a static ctor)

2005-11-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs: Added backend code for finding char arrays and strings
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Added mouse wheel scroll support
	  - Added support for VScroll and HScroll events
	* RichTextBox.cs:
	  - Implemented all seven Find() variants
	  - Implemented GetCharFromPosition()
	  - Implemented GetCharIndexFromPosition()
	  - Implemented GetLineFromIndex()
	  - Implemented GetPositionFromCharIndex();
	  - Implemented SaveFile for PlainText and UnicodeText
	  - Fixed set_Font, now setting a new font applies that font to
	    the whole document
	  - Implemented generic Document to RTF converter
	  - Implemented SaveFile for RichText format (still missing unicode
	    conversion for non-ansi chars)
	  - Implemented get_Rtf
	  - Implemented get_SelectedRtf

2005-11-09  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (WndProc): Call HandleClick after having sent OnMouseUp
	  to allow any captures to be released before triggering OnClick. This
	  way a click handler may capture the mouse without interference.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Always send mouse messages to grab window if one exists.
	  This way we send them even though X may not allow a grab (if the window
	  isn't visible, for example)

2005-11-08  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: 
	  - Draw the outside focus rectangle around buttons
	  - Use CPDrawFocusRectangle to draw focus rectangles until Cairo
	    doesn't use end caps for every dash of a line anymore. This
	    workaround ignores the forecolor.

2005-11-08  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Don't use ArgbColor with LayoutKind.Explicit as it isn't
	  endian safe.

2005-11-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Set the X/Y positions on the DragEventArgs correctly.

2005-11-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ScrollableControl.cs: Calculate the maximum and change vars
	(more) correctly so that scrollbars appear as a sensible size.

2005-11-04  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Refresh when nodes are cleared from the
	collection.
	* TreeView.cs: When the tree is sorted null out the top_node so
	that it is recalculated.
	- Use dotted lines instead of dashed lines to match MS better.

2005-11-04  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordimash@gmail.com>

	* ListView.cs: 
	  - Implements key search for items. Useful when browsing files with FileDialog
	  - When changing view mode or when clear the items reset scrollbar positions

2005-11-04  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* CurrencyManager.cs: Implement the MetaDataChanged event, the
	Reset method, and the CheckEmpty. CheckEmpty is just a total guess
	as to what the method may do as there is no real way of creating a
	derived CurrencyManager and calling the method. 

2005-11-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Implement ownerdrawing in the tab control
	* TabControl.cs: Add Ownerdrawing bits, add the UpdateTabSelection
	method which seems to just be used internally to refresh the tabs.

2005-11-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Implement the remove method. Fix some broken
	comments.

2005-11-03  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* DateTimePicker.cs:
	  - Added missing DateTimePickerAccessibleObject class
	  - Added missing events
	  - Added OnFontChanged method
	* Form.cs: Added missing attributes
	* TreeView.cs: Added missing attributes

2005-11-03  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* GridItemCollection.cs: Fix signatures

2005-11-03  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs: Updated build rev/date
	* ComboBox.cs, DataGridTextBoxColumn.cs Control.cs, 
	  DataGridTableStyle.cs, DataGrid.cs, DateTimePicker.cs: Signature fixes
	* Application.cs: Trigger context-specific ExitThread events

	* MonthCalendar.cs: Signature fixes

2005-11-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Remove should not be virtual.
	* TreeView.cs: Implement the last of the missing methods.

2005-11-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNodeConverter.cs: Implement to get off my class-status back.

2005-11-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Hookup the bits for drag and drop.
	* TreeNode.cs: Don't cache the tree_view or index anymore, now
	that nodes can be moved from tree to tree easily this just causes
	all sorts of problems.
	* TreeNodeCollection: Don't need to give treenodes an index and
	treeview anymore when they are added, these are computed on the
	fly. Also make sure to remove a node before its added.

2005-11-03  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs:
	  - Added CaretSelection enum
	  - Added comparison methods to Marker struct, makes selection code
	    more readable
	  - Added SelectionStart and SelectionEnd as 'moveable' location for
	    the CaretDirection enum and handler
	  - Added selection_prev variable to track optimized invalidation for
	    word and line selection
	  - Added SelectionVisible property (returns true if there is a valid 
	    selection)
	  - Switched CaretHasFocus to only display the caret if there is no
	    visible selection
	  - Avoiding StringBuilder.ToString to retrieve a single char, instead
	    using the direct character index; should be much faster
	  - Added various conditional debug statements
	  - Fixed invalidation calculation for selection ranges
	  - Added ExpandSelection() method to support word and line selection
	  - Switched SetSelectionToCaret to use new Marker compare overloads
	  - Added central IsWordSeparator() method to determine word 
	    separators/whitespace and FindWordSeparator() to streamline common
	    usage of IsWordSeparator()
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Removed unneeded grabbed variable, it was just mirroring
	    Control.Capture
	  - No longer firing OnTextChanged event when Text setter is called,
	    since the base will fire the event for us
	  - Added handling of Ctrl-Up/Down selection
	  - Added handling of Shift-Cursorkey selection
	  - Added handling for Ctrl-Delete and Ctrl-Backspace to remove
	    words
	  - Added handling of Shift and Ctrl-Shift-Home/End selection
	  - Removed some debug output
	  - Added handling for single/double/tripple-click to place caret/
	    select word/select line respectively (Fixes bug #76031)
	  - Added support for drag expansion of word/line selection
	* RichTextBox.cs: Handle GotFocus event to trigger redrawing of
	  current selection

2005-11-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: If the drag is going to and from a MWF window just
	copy the data instead of sending it out through the X Selection
	mechanism.

2005-11-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs:
	* XplatUIX11.cs: When in a drag we don't want motion notify
	messages to get passed on to the other controls. This prevents
	mouse move messages from showing up in the drag source.

2005-11-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Remove unneeded call to XAllowEvents.  Make sure that
	the correct button is release to end a drag.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Make the button state internal so the drag system
	can access it.  Dragging needs to know about all button releases,
	not just left button.

2005-11-02  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Form.cs (Icon): If the icon is null, reset the icon to the
	default value. 

	* Cursor.cs: When writing the AND-mask bitmap do not include the
	number of colors, but hardcode those to two (black and white),
	fixes the loading of color cursors (Paint Dot Net).

	* Form.cs: To debug, allow MONO_MWF_SCALING=disable variable to
	turn off autoscaling.

	* Cursor.cs: Allow resource type to be 1 or 2 (from ImageMagic).

2005-11-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Make sure to send a status message if the pointer
	enters a control that can not accept a drop, otherwise the cursor
	isn't updated correctly. Also tried to compress the lines of code
	a bit.

2005-11-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Change cursors based on drag action. Also attempt to
	set actions correctly.  This isn't perfect as XDND and win32 have
	some differences on how you allow actions. I'll clear this up by
	adding a path for drag from MWF to MWF windows.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Hook into the dnd system.

2005-11-02  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jmas@softcatala.org>

	* ListView.cs: Fixes scroll bar visibility. Hide them if they were
	previously shown but they are no longer need it. Very obvious when 
	browsing files with FileDialog.

2005-11-01  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: We always need to call OnPaintBackground. We pretty much
	  ignore AllPaintingInWmPaint and always do the painting there, whether 
	  it's set or not, since we always ignore the WM_ERASEBKGND message 
	  (which we don't generate on X11). This fixes #76616.
	* Panel.cs: Removed unneeded background painting. This happens properly
	  in Control.cs already

2005-10-31  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Menu.cs: Add items to collection before setting their index.
	* MenuItem.cs : add range checking with ArgumentException like MS.
	[Fixes #76510]

2005-10-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Invalidate if the area is visible at all not just
	contained in the visible rect. Fixes unselection of semi visible
	items.

2005-10-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Consistently name the dnd methods. Make them
	internal so we can override them to match some MS behavoir
	internally.
	* Win32DnD.cs: Use the new consistent names.

2005-10-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Don't draw the selected node when we lose focus.

2005-10-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: We still need to reset the state even though a full
	reset isn't being done, otherwise status's still get sent all over
	the place.

2005-10-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Make the dnd_aware flag internal so the dnd
	subsystem can check it. Catch exceptions thrown in dnd handlers to
	match MS behavoir.
	* Hwnd.cs: Add a flag for whether or not a window is dnd aware.
	* X11Dnd.cs: Handle null data in the converters. Set the XDND
	version when sending a XdndEnter. Use the control/hwnd dnd_aware
	flags to reduce the number of dnd enters/status's sent.

2005-10-31  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Don't need the sizeof here. Patch by Jordi Mas.

2005-10-31  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* PictureBox.cs: Fixes 76512

2005-10-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Dnd.cs: Early implementation to support winforms being a drag
	source for data on X11. Also restructured the converters so they
	can go both ways now.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Tie ins to the the Dnd stuff.
	
2005-10-27  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Fixed FIXME - implemented ASCII encoding for XA_STRING
	  clipboard requests

2005-10-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Implement serialization so my DnD examples will work.

2005-10-24  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ButtonBase.cs, ListView.cs, NotifyIcon.cs, PictureBox.cs, ToolBar.cs,
	  TreeView.cs: Don't dispose objects that are not owned.
	  
2005-10-24  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Cursor.cs: Defaulting the Current cursor to Cursors.Default. We
	  should retrieve the current cursor and report that, but XplatUI
	  doesn't (yet) have an interface for that (and I'm not sure I even
	  can, on X11)
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Fixed override behaviour. The override is temporary,
	  until any message loop processing is done (and the WM_SETCURSOR
	  replaces the cursor to the proper one)
	* XplatUIX11.cs: 
	  - Fixed override behaviour, we can't set the cursor globally on X11, 
	    just for our windows.
	  - Invalidating the System.Drawing X11 display handle when we are
	    shutting down
	* Control.cs: Fix to make csc happy

2005-10-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: 
	  - get_Text: Add last line (without trailing newline) to returned
	    value (Fixes 76212)
	  - get_TextLength: Count last line in returned length
	  - ToString: Call Text property instead of duplicating code

2005-10-23  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Dispose ImageAttributes objects.

2005-10-22  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Use attribute constructors with less arguments where
	  possible.

2005-10-22  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Added lastKeyIndex field and use in IndexOfKey.
	  Use typeof instead of strings when assembly is referenced. Added
	  some more comments.

2005-10-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ListView.cs: Raise a double click event. Also tried to somewhat
	fix when the selectedindexchanged event is raised. Its still
	broken though.

2005-10-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: New method to invalidate the plus minus area of a
	node without invalidating the whole node (maybe this can be used
	in some more places).
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: When adding to an empty node we need to
	invalidate its plus minus area so the little block shows up.
	
2005-10-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Make sure that when we invalidate a node the bounds
	are big enough to cover the selected box and the focus
	rectangle. Use a different colour for the lines connecting nodes
	so they show up with all themes.

2005-10-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* NativeWindow.cs: Don't call anything that could call into the driver,
	  we might be on a different thread.

2005-10-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs(Dispose): Since Dispose might run on a different thread,
	  make sure that we call methods that could call into the driver via
	  invoke, to avoid thread issues

2005-10-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs: Removed finalizer
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Removed Destructor, was causing crashes due to X11
	  not allowing to be called on the finalizer thread.

2005-10-21  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs:
	  - Reverted r51889 and r51891.
	  - Added ImageListItem class that stores unmodified image items and image
	    properties required to create list images until handle is created.
	  - Added AddItem and moved image creation logic to AddItemInternal.
	  - Added CreateHandle method that creates images based on unmodified items.
	  - Added DestroyHandle that changes state to store unmodified items.
	  - Add and AddStrip methods no more create handle.
	  - ReduceColorDepth has no return value.
	  - Dispose destroys handle.
	  - Modified other methods to reflect the above changes.
	  - Implemented key support.
	  - Added profile 2.0 members and attributes.
	  - Added private Reset and ShouldSerialize methods that provide the same
	    behavior as MS.NET but the Visual Studio .NET designer seems to ignore
	    them as they are private.
	  - Added some more comments about implementation details.

2005-10-21  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* DataGrid.cs: Adds support for vertical scrolling using the mousewheel

2005-10-21  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* Binding.cs: No PushData/PullData if there is no binding (fixes crash)

2005-10-21  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* DataGridDrawingLogic.cs: Fixes column hit calcultation
	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs: Remove debug message

2005-10-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: We can always get input keys regardless of whether
	or not editing is enabled. They are used for navigation.

2005-10-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Use the viewport rect for determining if a node
	needs to be moved for visibility. Don't use Begin/End edit. This
	calls a full refresh when its done.
	* TreeView.cs: New SetBottom works correctly.  Make the viewport
	rect property internal so the treenodes can see it. When clicking
	on a node we need to ensure that its visible because it might just
	be partly visible when clicked.

2005-10-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Remove debug code.

2005-10-20  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* Datagrid.cs: Implements column sorting in Datagrid
	* DataGridColumnStyle.cs: Implements column sorting in Datagrid

2005-10-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Remove items properly. Update the correct
	area after removing them.

2005-10-20  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* Datagrid.cs: Should not call base.OnPaintBackground

2005-10-20  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (GetMessage):
	  - Now properly calculates NC_xBUTTONDOWN coordinates off the whole
	    window instead of client window
	  - Now properly calculates NC_xBUTTONUP message coordinates
	  - ScreenToMenu now properly calculates it's coordinates of whole 
	    window, since menus are in the whole window, not in the client
	    window
	  - Added WholeToScreen coordinate translation method

2005-10-20  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUIX11.cs (GetMessage): Don't return in situations where we don't
	  want to return a message, loop back to the beginning of the function
	  and grab the next real message to process instead.

2005-10-20  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Splitter.cs: Properly set limits if no filler control is used

2005-10-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ColorDialog.cs: Don't show the help button if it is not enabled
	instead of disabling it	(this is what MS does). Don't create the
	panel until the dialog is run, otherwise the vars (such as
	ShowHelp) are not set yet.

2005-10-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Implement Begin/EndEdit more correctly so refreshes
	are reduced when adding nodes.
	* TreeNode.cs:
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Use UpdateNode instead of refreshing the
	tree.
	
2005-10-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs: End editing our treeview so the window
	actually gets refreshed.

2005-10-18  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Fixed logic flip on when to call OnPaintBackground. 
	  Obsoleted handling of WM_ERASEBKGND, now always draws our background
	  inside of WM_PAINT

2005-10-18  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* MenuAPI.cs: Returns after Hidding window
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Added TODO found while debugging menu issues

2005-10-18  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Do not re-map the whole window when it's size
	  becomes non-zero unless it's supposed to be actually visible

2005-10-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: We don't need to keep a count anymore.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Fix off by one in RemoveAt, Insert can
	use the Grow method.

2005-10-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Insert is not supported on arrays, so
	implement it manually here.

2005-10-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Dont kill the list when the colour depth is
	changed, just change the colour depth of all the images.
	- Same goes for setting the image size. Just resize them all
	instead of killing the list softly.

2005-10-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Don't invalidate empty rectangles.

2005-10-18  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs:
	  - Adds checked item to the Checked/Item lists (where empty before)
 	  - Do not add items to the Selected lists if they are already present
	* ListView.cs:
 	  - Fixes IsFixedSize, SyncRoot, IsReadOnly in many collections
	  - When deleting items make sure that we delete them for the Selected
	  and Checked list also.

2005-10-18  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* Label.cs: Dispose objects no longer used
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Dispose objects no longer used

2005-10-18  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Don't refresh the whole control when the tabs are
	scrolled, we just need to refresh the tab area.

2005-10-17  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Compress code a little bit. Only calculate the
	after handle when we need it.

2005-10-17  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: When the parent size changes, recalculate anchor 
	  positions. Partial fix for #76462

2005-10-17  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Make sure the picturebox has it's background 
	  drawn. Fixes #76462

2005-10-17  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MonthCalendar.cs: Don't create the numeric up down until our
	handle is created. Otherwise our handle is created in the
	constructor and we don't know if we are a WS_CHILD or WS_POPUP
	yet.

2005-10-17  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Merge in patch by Rafael Teixeira to align strings
	correctly.

2005-10-17  Rafael Teixeira <rafaelteixeirabr@hotmail.com> 
	* TreeNode.cs : small logical fix (was using local var instead of field)
	
2005-10-17  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Fixes vert/horz scrollbar colours

2005-10-17  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Fixes focus drawing in for non-flat/popup buttons

2005-10-16  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: 
	  - Re-implemented anchoring code. My first version was really broken.
	    This fixes bug #76033. Unlike the previous implementation we will
	    no longer have round errors since all numbers are calculated from
	    scratch every time. Removed various anchor-related obsolete vars.
	  - InitLayout no longer causes layout event firing and layout to be 
	    performed

2005-10-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Hwnd.cs: Compute invalid area correctly (fixes my last commit
	which was broken).

2005-10-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Remove debug code.

2005-10-16  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XEventQueue.cs: Increase the default queue size (very simple
	apps needed to grow the queue).
	* Hwnd.cs: No finalizer so we don't need to suppress
	finalization. Compute the invalid area manually so a new rectangle
	does not newto be created.
	* ScrollableControl.cs: Don't set any params (otherwise visibility
	isn't set correctly).
	* MdiChildContext.cs: New constructor takes the mdi parent so it
	doesn't have to be computed and avoids a crash on windows. Draw
	the window icon properly, and allow the text to be seen.
	* Form.cs: Use new MdiChildContext constructor. Make sure the
	child context isn't null in wndproc.
	* TabControl.cs: Don't set focus, this is muddling keyboard
	behavoir. Expand the tab rows when a window size increase will
	allow extra tabs to be seen. Don't allow tabs smaller than the
	width of a window to be scrolled out of view.
	* TreeNode.cs:
	* TreeView.cs: Use measure string to calculate a nodes width, the
	width is cached and only updated when the text or the font is
	changed. Don't check for expand/collapse clicks on the first level
	nodes if root lines are disabled.
	
2005-10-16  Ritvik Mayank  <mritvik@novell.com>

	* TextBoxBase.cs: Fixes #76352 (passing tab key in a multiline textbox)

2005-10-16  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* DataGridBoolColumn.cs: fixes warning

2005-10-16  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* ControlPaint.cs: Fixes methods Dark, DarkDark, Light, LightLight
	to match more to match more precisely the MS Net behavior

2005-10-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Hwnd.cs: Added field to track if window is mapped
	* XplatUIX11.cs: 
	  - Unmap windows if they become 0-size, re-map when 
	    they are >0 again; fixes #76035
	  - Re-set our error handler after initializing X11Desktop
	    to override any error handlers Gtk or whatever was called
	    may have set.

2005-10-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* CheckedListBox.cs: Removed unused vars
	* ListView.cs: Fixed signatures
	* RichTextBox.cs: Removed unused vars
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Removed unused vars
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Removed unused vars
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Removed unused vars
	* XplatUI.cs: Updated version and date to latest published

2005-10-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Cursor.cs: Added private .ctor to work around a bug in
	  resourceset (Thanks to Geoff Norton for the help on this)
	* SplitterEventArgs.cs: Made fields accessible so we don't
	  waste boatloads of objects and can reuse the same one
	  in Splitter
	* XplatUIWin32.cs(DrawReversibleLine): Now also considers
	  any captions and borders when generating screen coordinates
	* Splitter.cs: Reimplemented control, now fully complete, uses
	  rubberband drawing, supports and obeys all properties, has
	  proper cursors

2005-10-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Form.cs (Form): Setup default values for autoscale and
	autoscale_base_size;  Make these instance variables, not static
	variables. 

	(OnLoad): on the first load, adjust the size of the form.

2005-10-13  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs: Added 
	  width argument to DrawReversibleRectangle()
	* XplatUIWin32.cs, XplatUIX11.cs: 
	  - Implemented width for DrawReversibleRectangle()
	  - Added logic to DrawReversibleRectangle that recognizes a zero
	    width or height and only draws a line in that situation
	
2005-10-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs: Added GetAutoScaleSize()
	* XplatUIOSX.cs: Stubbed GetAutoScaleSize() method
	* XplatUIWin32.cs, XplatUIX11.cs: Implemented GetAutoScaleSize()
	  method (it uses our FosterParent window to get a graphics context)

2005-10-12  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs: Removed EraseWindowBackground 
	  and SetWindowBackground methods
	* Control.cs:
	  - Setting proper ControlStyles
	  - We no longer call XplatUI.SetWindowBackground and XplatUI.
	    EraseWindowBackground, instead we draw the window background
	    ourselves in PaintControlBackground. This behaviour is
	    required to match MS, where, when OnPaintBackground is not
	    called, the background is not drawn.
	  - Removed unneeded Refresh() in set_Text
	* Hwnd.cs: Dropped the ErasePending support. No longer needed
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Created DeriveStyles method to translate from CreateParams to
	    FormBorderStyle and TitleStyle, also handles BorderStyle (which
	    matches FormBorderStyle enum values)
	  - Consolidated SetHwndStyles and CalculateWindowRect border/title
	    style calculations into single DeriveStyles method
	  - Fixed CreateWindow to (finally) use Gravity. This prevents X11
	    from redrawing the whole window on any resize or expose.
	  - Fixed CreateWindow usage of SetWindowValuemask. Before not
	    all styles were applied to our whole/client window appropriately
	  - Removed EraseWindowBackground() and SetWindowBackground() methods
	  - Removed handling of WM_ERASEBKGND message from DefWndProc, we
	    no longer clear/redraw the background through X
	  - Removed handling of erase_pending bit, we have no use for it (or
	    so it seems)
	* XplatUIOSX.cs:
	  - Removed generation and handling of WM_ERASEBKGND message
	  - Removed EraseWindowBackground() and SetWindowBackground() methods
	  - Removed handling of hwnd.ErasePending flag
	* XplatUIWin32.cs:
	  - Removed EraseWindowBackground() and SetWindowBackground() methods
	  - We no longer call EraseWindowBackground on PaintEventStart, we 
	    ignore the fErase flag, erasing is handled in Control in the
	    background handler
	* Button.cs, GroupBox.cs, Label.cs, CheckBox.cs, ProgressBar.cs,
	  LinkLabel.cs, ListControl.cs, TabPage.cs, UpDownBase.cs,
	  TextBoxBase.cs, TextBox.cs, ListView.cs, ButtonBase.cs, 
	  CheckedListBox.cs, MdiClient.cs, Panel.cs, DataGrid.cs, 
	  DataGridTextBox.cs, ScrollBar.cs, ListBox.cs, TrackBar.cs, 
	  TabControl.cs, ScrollableControl.cs, ToolBar.cs, PictureBox.cs,
	  DateTimePicker.cs, StatusBar.cs, MonthCalendar.cs: Setting proper ControlStyles

	 - Fixed drawing issues

2005-10-10  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs: Switched from BorderStyle to 
	  FormBorderStyle enum
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Switched BorderStyle to FormBorderStyle, added 
	  code to determine FormBorderStyles from CreateParams
	* Form.cs:
	  - Fixed bug where we'd set the wrong window styles if we were
	    not creating an MDI window
	  - Added call to XplatUI.SetBorderStyle when form borders are set
	* Control.cs: Casting BorderStyles to accommodate changed XplatUI APIs
	* Hwnd.cs:
	  - Removed obsolete edge style
	  - Switched from BorderStyle to FormBorderStyle
	
2005-10-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: Use the property to get the window handle instead of
	accessing it directly. Prevents a null reference exception.

2005-10-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Don't adjust the rect given to DrawString now that
	our libgdiplus draws correctly.

2005-10-08  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Don't try to find the clicked on node if there are
	no nodes in the tree.

2005-10-08  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* RichTextBox.cs:

	  restore

2005-10-08  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

	* ImageListStreamer.cs, TreeView.cs, UpDownBase.cs, RichTextBox.cs,
	  ColorDialog.cs, TextControl.cs, Panel.cs, MdiChildContext.cs,
	  ErrorProvider.cs:
	  Use ResPool for brushes and dispose System.Drawing objects that
	  are not used anymore.

2005-10-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiChildContext.cs: Use the new borders instead of drawing them
	ourselves.

2005-10-06  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* Calling UpdateBounds after changing the window's BorderStyle 
	since the style can change the ClientSize

2005-10-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Made PaintControlBackground virtual
	* Panel.cs: Overriding PaintControlBackground instead of using paint
	  event; paint event method was interfering with 'real' users of the
	  event.

2005-10-06  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: remove border drawing since it is handled
	by the base control class now and was causing double border drawing.

2005-10-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Panel.cs: Redraw our background on paint. Not a pretty solution,
	  but it does seem to match MS behaviour. This fixes bug #75324

2005-10-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: A better DrawReversibleRectangle version, however
	  somewhat hackish looking

2005-10-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - We now accept Enter even if AcceptEnter is false, if the containing
	    form does not have an AcceptButton configured (fixes bug #76355)
	  - Calculations are now fixed to no longer use Width/Height, but
	    ClientSize.Width/Height, since we now support borders (this was
	    a result of fixing borders and therefore bug #76166)
	  - We no longer show the horizontal scrollbar if TextBox.WordWrap is 
	    true (fixes bug #76354)
	
2005-10-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: 
	  - Defaulting BorderStyle and setting it in XplatUI when our window 
	    is created
	  - Added enum check to InternalBorderStyle setter

	  - Now properly calculates WM decorations offset for toplevel 
	    windows (fixes bug #74763)

	    the border for us)
	  - Fixed the signature for SetWindowLong
	* PictureBox.cs, DataGrid.cs, TextBoxBase.cs, ToolBar.cs, Panel.cs,
	  ListBox.cs, Label.cs: Now uses Control.InternalBorderStyle for 
	  setting borders
	* UpDownBase.cs: Remove drawing of borders, this is handled by
	  the driver, outside the client area
	* ListView.cs: Removed bogus border calculations. The control should
	  be oblivious to borders, since those are not part of the client
	  area. 
	* X11DesktopColors.cs: Commented out (currently) unneeded variables
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Removed border calculations from ListView 
	  drawing code

2005-10-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

2005-10-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs: 
	  - Added loading and setting of our new default icon
	  - Only set icon if window is already created

2005-10-06  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Label.cs:
	  - Do not explicitly set the foreground and background colors, to
	    allow inheriting from parents (fixes #76302)
	  - Use Control's InternalBorderStyle property to deal with borders

2005-10-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiChildContext.cs: Use the new xplatui function to draw a
	reversible rect.

2005-10-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: Add the parent before creating the child context cause
	we need the parent when setting up the child.

2005-10-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* FolderBrowserDialog.cs: redo the tree population code so a
	second thread isn't used. Should be a lot faster and more stable
	now.

2005-10-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: There are no expand/collapse boxes if the node has
	no children.

2005-10-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11DesktopColors.cs: Get menu colours for the gtk theme.

2005-10-05  Alexander Olk  <alex.olk@googlemail.com>

2005-10-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: If updating the root node do a full refresh.
	* TreeNode.cs: The root node should be expanded by default. Also
	added a utility prop to tell if we are the root node.
	* TreeNodeCollection.cs: Only refresh if the node we are being
	added to is expanded. Also added a comment on a potential
	optimization.
	
2005-10-04  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Cursor.cs, Hwnd.cs: Added call to GC.SuppressFinalize() 
	  in dispose method. Fixes #76330

	  Create handle. NET_2_0: Destroy handle when value is null.

2005-10-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs: My last scrollbar patch was broken. This is a
	revert and a new patch to prevent the thumb from refreshing so
	much.

2005-10-02  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ScrollBar.cs: Don't update position if it hasn't actually
	changed. This occurs when you hold down the increment/decrement
	buttons and the thumb gets to the max/min.

2005-10-01  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs:
	* MdiChildContext.cs:

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Added call to initialize X11DesktopColors

2005-09-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Theme.cs: 
	  - Switched Theme color names to match the names defined in 
	    System.Drawing.KnownColors. Life's hard enough, no need to make 
	    it harder.
	  - Added setters to all theme color properties so themes can set
	    their color schemes. The setters also propagate the color changes
	    to System.Drawing.KnownColors via reflection
	* ControlPaint.cs,  Label.cs, TextControl.cs, ToolTip.cs, ThemeNice.cs,
	  ComboBox.cs, MdiChildContext.cs, TextBoxBase.cs, DateTimePicker.cs
	  DataGridColumnStyle.cs, MonthCalendar.cs, TreeView.cs: Updated to
	  use the new, more logical theme color names
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Updated the GetSysColorIndex enum to include new
	  post-NT colors
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
	  - Removed code to set the old classic Windows colors. Instead it
	    now relies on the colors returned by System.Drawing.KnownColors
	    which will be either modern static colors (Unix) or colors
	    read from the user's configuration (Win32)
	  - Updated to use the new, more logical theme color names
	  - Switched DataGrid drawing code to use only Theme colors instead of
	    a mix of System.Drawing.KnownColors and Theme colors
	  - DrawFrameControl(): Removed code that fills the button area, the
	    fill would overwrite any previous fill done by a control. This
	    fixes bug #75338 
	  - Added DrawReversibleRectangle() stub
	* ScrollableControl.cs: Set visible state to false when scrollbars
	  are removed (pdn fix)
	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs: Added 
	  DrawReversibleRectangle() method to allow drawing primitive 
	  'rubber bands'
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Implemented DrawReversibleRectangle()

2005-09-30  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

		- Fixes detail mode
		- Sets clippings
		- Issues with drawing

2005-09-30  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Moved RecreateHandle back to ImageList as event
	  source has to be the ImageList.

2005-09-30  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Add(Icon): Use Graphics.DrawIcon instead of Icon.ToBitmap.

2005-09-30  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs: ReduceColorDepth: Clean up pointer operations.

2005-09-30  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs: ImageCollection: Removed owner field as it is no more used.

2005-09-29  Jonathan Chambers <jonathan.chambers@ansys.com>
	* GridItem.cs: Fixed TODOs
	* GridItemCollection.cs: Added ICollection interface

2005-09-30  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Resize icons when needed.

2005-09-29  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* ListViewItem.cs
		- Fixes GetBounds and returns on screen rects
	* ListView.cs:
		- Fixes vertical and horzintal scrolling of items

		- Fixes drawing
		
2005-09-29  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@gmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs (ImageStream) [NET_2_0]: Reflect re-factoring.

2005-09-29  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Added comments about handle creation. Moved Handle,
	  HandleCreated and OnRecreateHandle implementations to ImageCollection.
	  Handle is created in Add methods.

2005-09-28  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>
	 
	* DataGridDrawingLogic.cs: 
		- Takes rows into account on Colum calculations
		- Returns the column when clickig
	* DataGrid.cs:
		- Fixes default HitTestInfo values
		- Fixes HitTestInfo.ToString
		- Fixes ResetBackColor		
	
2005-09-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiChildContext.cs: Obey rules for fixed sized windows (no
	sizing or cursor changes). Also added some temp code to draw the
	titlebars text (Makes dev a little easier).

2005-09-28  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs: AddStrip: Throw ArgumentException when Image is not a Bitmap.

2005-09-28  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>
	 
	* ListBox.cs: Fixes bug 76253

2005-09-28  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@hotmail.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Added comments about the current implementation. Added
	  ReduceColorDepth, IndexedColorDepths and GetNearestColor to can use
	  Format32bppArgb to preserve transparency and can use Graphics.FromImage
	  while using the specified ColorDepth. ReduceColorDepth uses unsafe code
	  with Bitmap.LockBits for better performance. Revised the whole file to
	  match MS.NET behaviour and provide better performance. Non-public
	  interface members are calling public members even when they throw
	  NotSupportedException for better maintainability. Moved ColorDepth,
	  ImageSize, ImageStream and TransparentColor implementations to
	  ImageCollection for better performance as these properties are not used
	  by ImageList.
	* ImageListStreamer.cs: Added a new internal constructor that takes an
	  ImageList.ImageCollection and serializes Images based on
	  ImageCollection.ToArray(). Renamed ImageColorDepth to ColorDepth to
	  match ImageList property name.

2005-09-28  Kazuki Oikawa <kazuki@panicode.com>

	* ListBox.cs: Fixes IndexFromPoint for last item

2005-09-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs: Set the position of new mdi children correctly.

2005-09-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiClient.cs: New mdi children need to be added to the back of
	the controls collection so the zorder is set correctly. Also add a
	count of all the child windows that have been created.

2005-09-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs (CreateParams): Setup MDI forms correctly.

2005-09-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MdiChildContext.cs:
	* MonthCalendar.cs:
	* UpDownBase.cs:
	* ListBox.cs:
	* ListView.cs:
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	* TreeView.cs:
	* ScrollableControl.cs:
	* ComboBox.cs: Add implicit controls using the new implict control
	functionality in ControlCollection. Also try to block multiple
	control add in a suspend/resume layout to save some cycles.
	
2005-09-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Add functionality to the controls collection to add
	'implicit controls' these are controls that are created by the
	containing control but should not be exposed to the user. Such as
	scrollbars in the treeview.
	* Form.cs: The list var of the ControlsCollection is no longer
	available because of the potential of implicit controls getting
	ignored by someone accessing the list directly.

2005-09-26  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Fixed SetChildIndex; it no longer causes a child to
	  loose it's parent. (Fixed bug introduced in r49103 when we added
	  setting the child parent to null on Remove)

2005-09-26  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* DataGridBoolColumn.cs: Marked CheckState private to fix public API.
	* Splitter.cs: Added missing attributes for BorderStyle property.

	* TextBox.cs: Fixed DefaultValue for PasswordChar property to match
	MS.NET.

2005-09-26  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>
	 
	* ListBox.cs: Fixes navigation to the last item in multicolumn lists

2005-09-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Update the node bounds correctly regardless of
	whether the node is visible.

2005-09-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Don't dispose the image after it is added to the
	image list. Only reformat images that need to be resized.

2005-09-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ImageList.cs: Don't set the format when changing the image.

2005-09-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: We can't just assume the node has a font. Use the
	treeviews font if no node font is available.

2005-09-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Allow the scrollbars to be reset with negative
	values.
	- Don't add scrollbars to negative sized windows.

2005-09-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Update to use Mono.Posix.Native instead of plain
	old Mono.Posix. Also remove some stray code that shouldn't have
	been committed.

2005-09-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Attempt at proper sizing of the horizontal
	scrollbar. Also don't resize the scrollbars unless they are
	visible.

2005-09-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: We don't need to expand the invalid area when the
	selection changes, as this is all drawn in the node's bounding
	box. The area needs to be expanded (previous typo was contracting
	it) when the focus rect moves.

2005-09-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Display the selection box under the correct
	circumstances. We were rendering white text with no selection box
	before.

2005-09-23  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* TextControl.cs(Split): Now updates selection start/end if it points 
	  into a line that's being split. Fixes a FIXME and bug #75258

2005-09-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Binding.cs:
	* ListControl.cs: Don't use the path when retrieving binding
	managers from the binding context. My bat sense tells me that the
	path is only used on insertion.

2005-09-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Splitter.cs: Set the cursor an easier way. (Thanks peter).

2005-09-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Splitter.cs: There are special cursors used for splitting.
	* XplatUIX11.cs: The VSplit and HSplit cursors were backwards.

2005-09-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Splitter.cs: Change the cursor appropriately when the splitter
	is moused over, so the user actually knows there is a splitter
	there.

2005-09-22 Hisham Mardam Bey <hisham.mardambey@gmail.com>

       * Label.cs : Fix ToString method to give same output as MS.NET

2005-09-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Create the scrollbars when the handle is created
	and add them right away, just make them invisble. Also account for
	the window being shrunk vertically to the point that the vert
	scrollbar needs to be added.
	- Remove some 0.5 adjustments to get around anti aliasing issues.
	
2005-09-22  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>
	 
	* MainMenu.cs: Fixes default value
	* MenuItem.cs: Fixes default value

2005-09-22  Kazuki Oikawa  <kazuki@panicode.com>

	* AsyncMethodResult.cs: Fixes Control.Invoke is blocked infinitely.

2005-09-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Don't try to set the border style on the window if
	it hasn't been created. When the window is created the border
	style will be used.

2005-09-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (Update): Don't call XplatUI if we don't have a
	  window handle yet

2005-09-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* ContainerControl.cs: Instead of throwing an exception, print
	  a one-time warning about Validate not being implemented
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Removed debug output

2005-09-21  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Control.cs: Only set XplatUI background if we expect the windowing
	  system to handle the background. This stops controls that draw their
	  own background from flickering

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Support custom visuals and colormaps for window 
	  creation. This allows, amongst other things, using MWF X11 windows 
	  with OpenGL.

	    they can be accessed and overriden in derived classes
	  - First refactoring of some methods. Derived themes now don't 
	    need to duplicate the complete code from ThemeWin32Classic
	* ThemeNice.cs:
	  - Added nice StatusBar
	  - Derive from ThemeWin32Classic and not Theme
	  - Removed duplicate ThemeWin32Classic code

2005-09-20  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (ControlCollection.Add): If the value null is passed
	the control is ignored. 

	Optimize this loop.

2005-09-19  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* MenuAPI.cs: Replaced Application.Run() with a loop that tracks
	  PostQuitMessage state.
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Removed bogus PostQuitMessage P/Invoke with HWND arg

2005-09-19  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Application.cs: Our constructor will never get called, move 
	  initialization to fields; fixes bug #75933

2005-09-19 Hisham Mardam Bey <hisham.mardambey@gmail.com>

	* FileDialog.cs :
	        - Allow files to be selected properly using file name
		combo box.

		using file name combo box.

2005-09-16  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

		- Fixed #Mtd2 of ToolTipTest.RemoveToolTipTest.
	* ComboBox.cs:
		- When DropDownStyle is Simple, it does not show scrollbar 
		to the last item of the list.
		- When DropDownStyle is Simple, it crashed when the list was 
		scrolled down with the down cursor key.
		- Fixed a bug that when DropDownStyle is DropDownList, the 
		selected item was not shown.
		- The position of the selected item was not preserved when 
		the next dropdown happened.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs:
		- Items were wrapped at the right end.
	* CheckedListBox.cs:
		- Fixed Add method
	* ListBox.cs:
		- Items should be fully shown.
		- When resizing and vertical scrollbar disappeared, the item 
		of index 0 should be on the top of the list.
		- GetItemRectangle should consider the size of ver. scrollbar
	* StatusBar.cs:
		- SizingGrip area should not be allocated when it is not 
		displayed.
		- Now it reflects MinWidth of the containing panel and 
		fixed a crash that happens when its width becomes so small.

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Optimise the use of clipping

	  - some refactoring

2005-08-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* CreateParams.cs (ToString): Made output match MS
	* Control.cs (Text): Don't set Text or Focus via XplatUI unless 
	    handle is already created (to avoid forcing window creation)
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Set window text to caption after creating window,
	  in case Text was set before window was created
	* Form.cs: Use this.Text instead of a static string as caption

2005-08-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* NotifyIcon.cs: Don't set the window to visible; this screws
	  up Win32 (causes WM_NCPAINT to be sent on Win32, which calls
	  OnPaint without a bitmap)
	* XplatUIX11.cs: Removed Visible optimization in AddExpose; doesn't 
	  happen very often anyway; we could add the check to the WM_PAINT 
	  event generation code

2005-08-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* NotifyIcon.cs: Fill the icon area with a background color, to 
	  avoid 'residue' when transparent icons are drawn
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Handle whole_window == client_window when destroying windows
	  - SystrayAdd(): Set client_window to whole_window value to
	    get mouse and other events passed to NotifyIcon

2005-08-30  Peter Dennis Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com> 

	* Form.cs: Set proper default for Opacity property
	* NotifyIcon.cs:
	  - ShowSystray(): Don't bother creating telling the OS
	    about the systray item if no icon is provided
	  - Now handles WM_NCPAINT message to deal with whole/client window
	    split
	  - Create window as visible to not get caught by Expose optimization
	* Hwnd.cs: Removed debug message
	* ComboBox.cs, ScrollBar.cs, ListBox.cs, TrackBar.cs, TabControl.cs,
	  StatusBar.cs, TreeView.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs: Switched 
	    PaintEventStart/End to use new client argument
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Commented out debug messages
	  - Switched PaintEventStart/End to use new client argument
	* XplatUI.cs: Added client window bool to PaintEventStart()/
	  PaintEventEnd() calls, to support drawing in non-client areas
	* XplatUIDriver.cs: 
	  - Added client window bool to PaintEventStart()/PaintEventEnd() 
	    calls, to support drawing in non-client areas
	  - Added conditional compile to allow using MWF BeginInvoke 
	    on MS runtime
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Added some conditional debug output
	  - Fixed SystrayAdd() method to support new (for SystrayAdd, anyway)
	    whole/client window split
	  - Implemented handling of client argument to PaintEventStart()/End()
	* Control.cs:
	  - Throw exception if BeginInvoke() is called and the window handle
	    or one of the window's parent handles is not created
	  - Added conditional compile to allow using MWF BeginInvoke on
	    MS runtime
	  - get_Parent(): Only sets parent if handle is created. This avoids
	    forcing window handle creation when parent is set.
	  - Now fires Layout and Parent changed events in proper order
	  - Switched to use Handle instead of window.Handle for Z-Order setting,
	    the get_Parent() patch above causes us to possibly get null for 'window'
	  - Implemented handling of client argument to PaintEventStart()/End()
	  - Now reports back to windows that WM_SETCURSOR was handled (to avoid
	    default handling)
	  - Now sends a Refresh() to all child windows when Refresh() is called

2005-08-24  Rafael Teixeira <rafaelteixeirabr@hotmail.com> 
	-- Making Windows with Menus layout correctly --
	* Form.cs : The first leg of the fix
		Menu setter - adjust Client Size as needed to make space for the menu
		SetClientSizeCore - doesn't call base version to be able to pass the 
			menu handle to XplatUI.CalculateWindowRect
	* Hwnd.cs: Fix for menu_height, now gets from MenuAPI.MENU
	* XplatUIX11.cs: The critical second leg of the fix
		GetWindowPos needs to use a recalculated client_rect
		so that resizing the window doesn't break layout of child controls. 
		Also a more complete rule to avoid X Server roundtrips in SetWindowPos
		Lots of \t\n killed

	    calculates delta between previous and new selection and only
	    invalidates/redraws that area
	  - Fixed FindPos() math off-by-one errors

	    * fixed bogus offset calculation for tags not starting at index 1
	    * Switched behaviour from using multiple Substrings of a 
	      StringBuilder.ToString() to using multiple 
	      StringBuilder.ToString(start, length) statements, hoping this is
	      faster (kept original version commented out in the code, in case
	      original version was faster)
	* TextBox.cs (set_TextAlignment): TextBox always needs to wrap if 
	  alignment != Left
	* TextBoxBase.cs (CalculateDocument): Made protected so RichTextBox can
	  call it as well

	    supported

2005-06-02  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

2005-05-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	and sizing will not be recalculated unless ResizeTabPages is

	* TabPage.cs: Set base.Text instead of Text in the constructor so
	that UpdateOwner does not get called. Use the new Redraw method of
	TabControl instead of Refresh so the sizing is recalculated.

	  Sebastien Pouliot for CAS Stack Propagation

2005-05-03  Alexander Olk  <xenomorph2@onlinehome.de>

	* Control.cs: Modified version of Jonathan Chamber's fix for
	  double-buffering

2005-05-03  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	hatch brush.

2005-05-02  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* LinkLabel.cs: Fixed the fixes from r43566 and 43521

2005-04-29  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	outside the clipping rectangle.

2005-04-29  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	correct though).

2005-04-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Don't fill the middle of progress
	bars. This fills areas outside of the clip bounds that don't need
	to be filled.

2005-04-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Don't expose functionality to touch the image buffers.
	* ProgressBar.cs:
	* ListView.cs: We do not need to (and no longer can) manipulate

2005-04-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Keyboard.cs: Initialize a default keyboard and give a warning
	if a "correct" keyboard is not found. This will make us not crash,
	but might give some users bad keyboard layouts...seems to be the
	same thing rewind does.

2005-04-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* BindingManagerBase.cs: Attach the current/position changed
	handlers to their respective events.

2005-04-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Make sure that the first WM_PAINT does a full draw,
	not just a blit.
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Don't fill the background for picture
	boxes. This could overright user drawing.
	* ComboBox.cs: Just fill the clipping rect not the entire client
	rect when drawing the background. This prevents pieces of the
	image buffer from getting overwritten and is theoretically faster.

2005-04-26  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Use the horizontal scrollbars height not width when
	determining how much of the client area is available.

2005-04-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Double buffering is handled differently now. As per
	the spec, the extra buffer is created in the WM_PAINT message and
	passed down to the control's drawing code.
	* GroupBox.cs:
	* Label.cs:
	* CheckBox.cs:

2005-01-28  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* SWF.csproj: Deleted, no longer used. Instead,
	  Managed.Windows.Forms/SWF.csproj should be used

	  scroll

2005-01-28  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

2005-01-27  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Form.cs:
	  - Place window in default location, instead of hardcoded 0/0
	  - Send initial LocationChanged event
	* Control.cs:
	  - UpdateBounds after creation to find out where the WM placed us
	  - Make sure that if the ParentForm changes location the Form
	    is notified
	* XplatUIX11.cs: XGetGeometry will not return the coords relative
	    to the root, but to whatever the WM placed around us.
	    Translate to root coordinates before returning toplevel
	    coordinates
	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Removed debug output
	* XplatUIOSX.cs, XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs: Added toplevel

	  XplatUIX11.cs: Extended the Systray API

2005-01-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs:
	- Only invalidate the effected tabs when the
	selected index changes. This reduces drawing and gets rid of some
	flicker.
	- Only refresh if the tabs need to be shifted, otherwise only
	invalidate the slider button.
	- On windows the tabs are not filled to right if the slider is
	visible.
	
2005-01-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Only refresh on mouseup if we are showing the

	* Form.cs (CreateClientParams): Always set the location to 0,0
	  since we're a child window.

	* Control.cs (SetVisibleCore): Always explicitly setting the location
	  of a toplevel window, apparently X11 doesn't like to move windows
	  while they're not mapped.

2005-01-26  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Implement FillToRight size mode with vertically
	rendered tabs.

	  form can properly override CreateParams.
	* XplatUI.cs, XplatUIDriver.cs, XplatUIOSX.cs, XplatUIWin32.cs,
	  XplatUIX11.cs: Dropped RefreshWindow method, not needed if
	  Control performs Invalidate & Update
	* NativeWindow (CreateHandle): Added special handling for Form
	  and Form.FormParent classes to allow overriding of From.CreateParams
	* Control.cs:
	  - ControlNativeWindow: Renamed 'control' variable to more intuitive
	    name 'owner'
	  - ControlNativeWindow: Added Owner property
	  - Removed usage of Refresh() on property changes, changed into
	    Invalidate(), we need to wait until the queue is processed for
	    updates, direct calls might cause problems if not all vars for
	    Paint are initialized
	  - Added call to UpdateStyles() when creating the window, to set any
	    styles that CreateWindow might have ignored.
	  - Added support for Form CreateParent overrides to UpdateStyles()

	* UpDownBase.cs (ctor): Connect TextChanged in the entry to the
	OnTextBoxChanged.

	Capture LostFocus and OnTextBoxChanged.  The later introduces a
	recursive invocation that I have not figured out yet.

	Reset the timer when not using (it was accumulating).


	(OnTextBoxChanged): Set UserEdit to true here to track whether the
	user has made changes that require validation.

	Reset changing to avoid loops.

2005-01-22  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* NumericUpDown.cs: Display value at startup.

	* UpDownBase.cs (Text): Do not call UpdateEditText here, only call
	ValidateEditText.

	* NumericUpDown.cs: Minimum, Maximum, Text, Value properties
	filled in.  Added some basic parsing of text.

	Still missing the OnXXX method overrides, and figuring out the
	events that must be emitted.

2005-01-22  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	sized correctly.

2005-01-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabControl.cs: Use cliping rectangle for blitting. Give the
	theme the clipping rect so we can do clipping while
	drawing. Remove some debug code.

2005-01-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TabPage.cs: Add a new method so tab pages can force the tab
	control to recalculate the tab page sizes.

	sizes.

2005-01-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs: Clip text to the staus bar panels rects.

2005-01-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Set the bounds for nodes properly. They were
	getting screwed up when checkboxes were not enabled, but images
	were.

2005-01-20  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* ListBox.cs:
		- Owner draw support

	end editing when the users clicks outside the text box.
	
2005-01-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* X11Keyboard.cs: Fix typo that was causing the wrong keycodes to

	* RadioButton.cs: Added missing attributes
	* TextControl.cs: No longer draws selection if control does not
	  have focus
	* TextBoxBase.cs:
	  - Now draws simple rectangle around test area to make it obvious
	    there's a control. This is a hack until we properly support borders
	  - A few simple fixes to support selections better, now erases selected
	    text when typing, and resets selection when using movement keys

2005-01-19  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* UpDownBase.cs: Added some new properties.

2005-01-18  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Button.cs: Implemented DoubleClick event
	* ButtonBase.cs:
	  - Fixed keyboard handling to behave like MS, where the press of
	    Spacebar is equivalent to a mousedown, and the key release is
	    equivalent to mouseup. Now a spacebar push will give the same
	    visual feedback like a mouse click.
	  - Added missing attributes

	  - set_Menu: Cleaned up mess from early days of Form and Control,
	    now properly triggers a recalc when a menu is added/removed
	  - Added case to select form itself as focused form if no child
	    controls exist
	  - Added PerformLayout call when showing dialog, to ensure properly
	    placed controls
	* Control.cs:
	  - Select(): Made internal so Form can access it
	  - Focus(): Only call Xplat layer if required (avoids loop), and sets
	    status
	* Application.cs (Run): Removed hack and calls PerformLayout instead
	  to trigger calculation when Form becomes visible

2005-01-18  Jordi Mas i Hernandez <jordi@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: fixes for ownerdraw

2005-01-18  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	right hand corner when there are both horizontal and vertical
	scroll bars.

2005-01-14  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

2005-01-13  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* PictureBox.cs: Implement missing methods (except ToString, need

2005-01-12  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* OSXStrucs.cs: Added

2005-01-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Still need to draw lines to siblings even if out of
	the current node is out of the clip.

2005-01-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: When setting the hbar/vbar/grip position use
	SetBounds so that perform layout is only called once. Also suspend
	and resume layout so layout is only done once for all controls.
	- Removed some debug fluff
	* SizeGrip.cs: Call base implmentation in overriding methods.
	- When visibility is changed the drawing buffers are killed so we
	need to redraw.

2005-01-11  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Calculate the open node count while drawing. This
	saves us an entire tree traversal for every paint operation. Use
	a member var for the open node count so less vars are passed around.

2005-01-11  John BouAntoun  <jba-mono@optusnet.com.au>

	* MonthCalendar.cs:
	- fixed selection to use mousemove, not mouse polling on timer
	* ThemeWin32Classic.cs
	- removed redundant unused variable "no_more_content"
	
2005-01-11  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIX11.cs (DoEvents): Needs to return when no more events
	  are pending, so it now calls PeekMessage instead of GetMessage;
	  implemented a incomplete version of PeekMessage
	
2005-01-11  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* XplatUIWin32.cs: Switched P/Invokes to unicode charset to avoid
	  I18n issues
	* TextBoxBase.cs: Added sending of TextChanged event

2005-01-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs: Try not to draw outside the clipping rectangle on

	* ComboBox.cs: keyboard navigation, item navigation, bug fixes

2005-01-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeView.cs:
	- Implement fast scrolling. Now only the newly
	exposed nodes are drawn and the old image is moved using the
	XplatUI::ScrollWindow method.
	- Factor in height of nodes when calculating whether or not the
	node is in the clipping rect.

2005-01-10  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Implemented proper TabIndex handling, now assigning
	  a tabindex when a control is added to a container

	  for Control.GetNextControl()

2005-01-09  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Form.cs:
	  - Implemented SetDesktopBounds method
	  - Implemented SetDesktopLocation method

2005-01-08  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	when drawing.

2005-01-08  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@customerdna.com>

        * XplatUIOSX.cs: Fix GetWindowState & SetWindowState

2005-01-07  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TreeNode.cs: Just update the single node when it is
	checked. Don't refresh after toggling, the Expand/Collapse already
	handles this.
	* TreeView.cs: Respect clipping a little more when drawing. Try
	not to redraw things that don't need to be redrawn. Just hide the
	scrollbars when they are no longer needed instead of removing
	them, so they don't have to be created again and again.
	
2005-01-07  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@customerdna.com>

	* XplatUIOSX.cs (SetCaretPos):  We need to translate the view
	coordinates to window space to place the caret properly, FIXED.

2005-01-06  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Theme.cs: Speed up getting pens and solid brushes, by using
	their ARGB as a hash instead of tostring and not calling Contains.

	* Form.cs:
	  - Implemented OnActivated and OnDeactivate event trigger
	  - Implemented Activate() method
	  - Fixed ShowDialog() to activate the form that was active before
	    the dialog was shown
	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Added global active_window var that tracks the currently active
	    X11 window
	  - Now always grabs Property changes from the root window to always
	    catch changes on the active window property
	  - Added code to PropertyNotify handler to send Active/Inactive
	    messages when state changes. This puts X11 and Win32 en par on
	    WM_ACTIVATE notifications (except for double notifications when
	    the user clicks away from our modal window to another one of our
	    windows)

2005-01-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	  active window for the application (or null, if none is active)
	* Form.cs:
	  - Implemented ActiveForm
	  - Commented out owner assignment for modal dialogs (causes problems
	    on Win32, since the owner will be disabled)
	  - Reworked some Active/Focus handling (still incomplete)
	* CommonDialog.cs: Commented out owner assignment for modal dialogs
	  (causes problems on Win32, since the owner will be disabled)

2004-12-28  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Form.cs (get_CreateParams): Make sure we have an owner before using
	  the owner variable. Implement proper default if no owner exists

2004-12-28  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* In preparation for making Managed.Windows.Forms the default build target

2004-12-21  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	  forward so that anything that creates a window gets the default,
	  also no longer uses Visible property in CreateParams to avoid
	  walking up the parent chain and possibly get the wrong visible
	  status. Fixed IsVisible to no longer walk up to the parent.

2004-12-21  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Form.cs (ShowDialog): Unset modality for the proper window
 
2004-12-20  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* CommonDialog.cs: Initial check-in

2004-12-20  Peter Bartok  <pbartok@novell.com>

	* Control.cs (Visible): Now uses the parent window instead of the
	  client area window for the property

	* Form.cs
	  - ShowDialog(): Now uses the proper window for modality
	  - The default visibility state for the form parent is now false. This
	    will prevent the user from seeing all the changes to the form and
	    its controls before the application hits Application.Run()
	  - Removed some stale commented out code

	* NativeWindow.cs:
	  - Added FindWindow() method to have a method to check for existence
	    of a window handle

	    when debugging with VS.Net; to do this the ExternalExceptionHandler
	    define must be set
	  - Removed some useless debug output

	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Removed r37929 (SetModal patch from Ashwin Bharambe), was
	    not working as expected
	  - Implemented modal_window stack and checking for _WM_ACTIVE_WINDOW
	    property to allow switching back to the modal window if focus is
	    given to another one of our windows (Application Modal)
	  - Now only sets override_redirect if we create a window
	    without WS_CAPTION
	  - Moved EventMask selection before mapping of newly created window
	    so we can catch the map event as well
	  - Implemented Activate() method via the _WM_ACTIVE_WINDOW property
	  - Added various Atom related DllImports
	  - Implemented Exit() method
	  - .ctor() : No longer shows window if WS_VISIBLE is not defined
	    in the CreateParams

	* MessageBox.cs: Now properly deals with the FormParent window by
	  providing an override the FormParent CreateParams property to
	  set as POPUP instead of OVERLAPPED window.

2004-12-19  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@customerdna.com>

2004-10-04 21:18  jackson

2004-09-29 20:29  pbartok

	* XplatUIX11.cs:
	  - Added lookup of pixel value for background color; tries to get a
	    color 'close' to the requested color, it avoids having to create a
	    colormap.  Depending on the display this could mean the used color
	    is slightly off the desired color. Might have to change it to a more
	    resource intensive colormap approach, but it will work as a
	  workaround to avoid red screens.

2004-09-29 14:27  jackson

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Set the X DisplayHandle in System.Drawing

2004-09-28 12:44  pbartok

	  Theme.cs, ThemeGtk.cs, ThemeWin32Classic.cs, ToolBar.cs,

	    * ControlPaint methods for the theme now have a CP prefix to avoid
	      name clashes with the Draw methods for controls

	    * Every control now retrieves it's DefaultSize from the current

	  drawing

	* Timer.cs, X11Structs.cs, XplatUIX11.cs: Timers are now handled in

2004-09-08 01:00  jackson

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Only run the timers when updating the message
	  queue. This effectively gives X messages a higher priority then
	  timer messages. Timers still need love though

2004-09-07 14:01  jackson

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Do not call XDestroyWindow, X has already done
	  this for us and the handle is no longer valid.

2004-09-07 13:59  jackson

	* HandleData.cs, XplatUIX11.cs: First steps towards a new X event

2004-08-24 01:07  jackson

	* XplatUIX11.cs: Use a queue for async messages instead of passing
	  them as ClientMessages since that was totally broken. Also simply
	  check for events and return an idle message if none are found. This
