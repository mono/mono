		* ControlHandleTest.cs: make this build on both 1.1 and 2.0
		profiles.

	2007-02-28  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

		* ControlTest.cs: Flesh out ControlInvokeTest to make sure that
		the Control thread dies (that Application.Run returns, basically).
		This works in isolation, but for some reason it isn't exiting when
		run in concert with other tests (this test is the cause of the
		hangs running the unit tests.)  Marking NotWorking for the time
		being.  This needs to be fixed before merging back to the
		mainline, imo.

2007-03-02  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* FormTest.cs: Added MaximizedParentedFormTest.

2007-02-15  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DateTimePickerTest.cs: Use OSVersion to determine whether to call
	  GetUserDefaultLCID or not, seems like the runtime crashes on some
	  architectures instead of throwing an exception otherwise.

2007-02-15  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DateTimePickerTest.cs: Some culture dependant tests are only supposed
	  to run with en-US locale, so check it. On Windows call
	  GetUserDefaultLCID to check it, since MS DateTimePicker doesn't
	  honor Thread.CurrentCulture, only the Windows setting (and some
	  other test might have set Thread.CurrentCulture to some other
	  value, so the checking only this might fail). Added test for
	  setting invalid Text property.

	  that will log all the object's events.

2007-01-29  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

2007-01-23  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	be mucking with the ReadOnly property when the PropertyDescriptor

	* FocusTest.cs: Disable a couple of tests that rely on the
	focus/active control state being available directly after

	handling test andreia and I were using to correct problems in
	ContainerControl.set_ActiveControl.
	
	* FormTest.cs: add a test to show that even if OnActivate is
	overriden and not chained up to the base class, ActiveControl is
	still set.  Unfortunately it doesn't work on the X11 backend
