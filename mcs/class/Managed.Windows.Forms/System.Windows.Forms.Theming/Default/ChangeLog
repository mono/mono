	* ButtonPainter.cs: For Flat button, if no mouse over / press
	backcolor is specified, calculate one from the normal backcolor.

	* ButtonPainter.cs: For Flat button, if BorderSize is 0, don't
	draw the rectangle.  Setting the pen's width to 1 isn't good
	enough, it still draws the border.  [Fixes bug #82081]

	* ToolStripPainter.cs: Added. This is where we paint toolstrips
	using the ToolStripSystemRenderer.

	* TabControlPainter.cs: Use ControlPaint static methods
	instead of ThemeEngine ones (seeing as they're there and
	all :p )
