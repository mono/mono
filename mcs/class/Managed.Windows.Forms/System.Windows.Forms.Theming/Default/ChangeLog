2008-10-20  Jonathan Pobst  <monkey@jpobst.com>

	* TabControlPainter.cs: Add 1 pixel to the tab text rectangle

	* TabControlPainter.cs: When calculating the display rectangle for
	TabPage elements, don't include TabControlSelectedDelta.Y as part of
	the page height, since it is only added ad the end (this is the way
	it's done in TabControl). This way having a lot of pages with
	Multiline as true doesn't add much extra space between the tab pages
	labels and the actual tab pages area.
