	* SqliteCommand.cs (Prepare): Use UnixMarshal here to get proper
	utf8 behavior.

	* Sqlite.cs, SqliteCommand.cs: Report string error messages
	in prepare, for version 3.

	SQL commands can have multiple statements within them (i.e.
	separated by semicolons).  Sqlite has to be instructed to
	process each command.
	
	* Sqlite.cs: Pass the sql command as an IntPtr so we can
	  see where pzTail takes us.
	* SqliteCommand.cs: Lazily load sql_params for good measure.
	  Iterate compile/prepare until each statement in the string
	  has been processed, and retain pointers to each compiled
	  statement.  When executing, run all of the statements.

	* Sqlite.cs:
	- Added sqlite3_bind_* for native Sqlite3 Parameters
	* SqliteCommand.cs
	- Added methods for parameter processing/binding (sqlite3 uses bind / sqlite2 uses regEx to extract parameters)
	- Sqlite uses ':' as delimeter!
	* SqliteParameterCollection.cs
	- Chris Turchin fixed a problem in the Parameter Hashmap
	* SqliteTransaction.cs
	- The CommandText for the Rollback Command was "COMMIT" ! ->changed :)

	* SqliteConnection.cs:
	- SetConnectionString: trim white spaces, ignore empty connection
	string options.
	- SetConnectionString: if file://,db_file starts from pos 7 not 6.
