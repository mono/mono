	* Vector4f.cs: Added bitwise ops, reciprocal, interleave
	and all flavors of compare.
	Optimized Shuffle.

	* Vector8us.cs: It turns out that packuswb doesn't work with unsigned
	numbers that binary equivalent to negative numbers in signed form.
	Removed PackWithUnsignedSaturation.

	* Vector4ui.cs: Added SSE4.1 comment to relevant method. Removed
	PackWithUnsignedSaturation for the same reason as above.
