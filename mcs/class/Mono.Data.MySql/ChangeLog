	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlDataAdapter.cs
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlRowUpdatedEventArgs.cs
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlRowUpdatedEventHandler.cs
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlRowUpdatingEventArgs.cs
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlRowUpdatingEventHandler.cs: added new
	 files for the Data Adapter for the MySQL data provider
	
	* list: added new files to Linux build
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlCommand.cs: implement the
	interfaces correctly and Dispose().  Allow the provider to 
	execute multiple queries for a reader
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlTransaction.cs
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlConnection.cs: implement the 
	interfaces correctly and Dispose
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlDataReader.cs: implement the
	interfaces correctly and Dispose().  Allow the provider to 
	execute multiple queries for a reader.  Implement
	IEnumerable.GetEnumerator() to return a DbEnumerator
	which can be used to do a 
	foreach (DbDataRecord rec in myDataReader) { ... }
	and allows a IDataReader to be "data binded" to a DataGrid.
	Thanks goes to Tim Coleman (I copied this from his SqlDataReader).

	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlError.cs
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlErrorCollection.cs
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlException.cs: added files for
	MySQL Exceptions
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql.build: removed excludes for new
	files (thus adding them to the build) on Windows
	
	* list: added files to build on Linux
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlCommand.cs
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlConnection.cs: modified
	to throw a new MySqlException when a MySqlError occurs

2002-10-13  Daniel Morgan <danmorg@sc.rr.com>

	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlDataReader.cs: change "DataType" in 
	schema DataTable to be typeof(Type) instead of 
	typeof(string) to make it more like MS.NET
	
	* Test/MySqlTest.cs: tweaks

2002-10-13  Daniel Morgan <danmorg@sc.rr.com>

	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlCommand.cs:
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlConnection.cs:
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlDataReader.cs:
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlTypes.cs: modifed -
	handle MySQL types to .NET types and some fixes

2002-10-12  Daniel Morgan <danmorg@sc.rr.com>

	* Test/MySqlTest.cs: added file - to do
	  various Tests for the MySql provider
	  
	* Mono.Data.MySql/Field.cs: enum MySqlFieldFlags
	should be unit.  Rename class Field to MySqlMarshalledField
	to represent what it really is.  Redo handling of field Flags.
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySql.cs: added method AffectedRows() to 
	pinvoke	into mysql_affected_rows() so we can know what rows 
	were affected by an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE SQL statement.
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlCommand.cs: rename 
	internal method rowVal() to GetColumnData().  In GetColumnData,
	if IntPtr.Zero, return an empty "" string instead of "NULL".
	Pass command behavior to data reader.
		
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlDataReader.cs: redo the 
	way field meta data and data is structured so 
	a schema DataTable can be built.  Implement
	GetSchemaTable() to create a DataTable holding the schema
	of the fields.  Implemented more methods.
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlTypes.cs: added method to 
	translate System.Data.DbType to System.Type
	
	* est/TestMySqlExecuteReader.cs: minor tweaks

2002-10-11  Daniel Morgan <danmorg@sc.rr.com>

	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlTransaction.cs: added to
	  support transactions (BEGIN, COMMIT/ROLLBACK).
	  
	* Mono.Data.MySql.build: included MySqlTransaction 
	  in build on Windows
	  
	* list: included MySqlTransaction
	  in build on Linux
	  
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySql.cs: the mysql thread functions
	  were misnamed and prevented them from being loaded
	  by the mono JIT - my_thread_init() and my_thread_end().
	  Now, threading should work in the MySQL provider and
	  less memory leaks too.
	  
	* Mono.Data.MySql/Test.cs: remove conditional comiliation
	  since everything compiles fine on Mono now
	  
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlCommand.cs: remove Console.WriteLine()
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlConnection.cs: added transaction 
	  support, implemented method ChangeDatabase(), implemented
	  property ServerVersion
	  
	* Test/TestMySqlInsert.cs: modified test 
	  to handle transactions

2002-10-10  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@ximian.com>

	* makefile.gnu: added makefile for linux build.

	* list: updated to contain all missing files.

	* Mono.Data.MySql/makefile: removed unneeded makefile.

2002-10-09  Daniel Morgan <danmorg@sc.rr.com>

	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlDataReader.cs: added
	  started implementing Reader for MySQL provider
	  
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlTypes.cs: added
	  to hold internal helper methods, enums, structs, classes
	  for handling MySQL data types

	* Test/TestMySqlExecuteReader.cs
	* Test/TestMySqlExecuteScalar.cs: added simple tests
	  for ExecuteScalar() and ExecuteReader() methods
	  in MySqlCommand.  We are able to retrieve data
	  from MySQL now.

	* Mono.Data.MySql.build: took out exclude
      so MySqlExecuteReader.cs will build
      
    * Mono.Data.MySql/Field.cs: added enum to file
      and added helper methods field flags
      
    * Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlCommand.cs: started
      implementation of ExecuteScalar nd ExecuteReader methods
      to retrieve data.  Also, added internal method rowVal
      for marshalling field data.
      
    * Mono.Data.MySql/Test.cs: take out a bunch of
      Console.WriteLines'
 
2002-08-13  Daniel Morgan <danmorg@sc.rr.com>

	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlCommand.cs: modified
	rowsRetrieved should be rowsAffected in ExecuteNonQuery
	because the number is only to show the rows affected
	by an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE; anything else, the
	number is -1
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql/Test.cs: modified
	enable retrieving the results from a query.  even though
	this still does not work for some reason, i thought
	i would enable it so others could see the problem.

2002-05-30  Daniel Morgan <danmorg@sc.rr.com>

	* Mono.Data.MySql.build: modified
	need to copy Mono.Data.MySql.dll to mcs/class/System.Data/Test
	so the SqlSharpCli test program can use MySql too

2002-05-30  Daniel Morgan <danmorg@sc.rr.com>
	
	* Test/TestMySqlInsert.cs: added test
	to do an SQL INSERT to insert a row into table.
	Works on cygwin compiled using mcs and mono and
	runs on mint, but it fails running on mono.
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlCommand.cs
	* Mono.Data.MySql/TODOAttribute.cs
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlConnection.cs: added
	
	* list: added
	so can build with mcs/mono on linux
	I only tested it on Cygwin though.
	To work on linux, the library name in the pinvokes
	in MySql.cs will need to be changed.
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql.build: modified
	exclude files from build.  also copy Mono.Data.MySql.dll
	to Mono.Data.MySql so you can build and run Test.cs
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySql.cs: modified
	tweaks to compile under mcs/mono and run under mint or mono.
	Runs under mint, but not mono. Had to comment out 
	mysql_thread_begin/mysql_thread_end functions because they refused
	to load in mono.  Until this is fixed, a memory leak will occur.
	Can not retrieve field data from MySQL because the PtrToStructure()
	needs to be implemented in System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal class.
	However, this will be very complicated to do.  So, we connect to
	MySQL and execute SQL Commands,	but we can not do Queries yet.
		
	* Mono.Data.MySql/Test.cs: modified
	tweaks to test C# bindings with compiling mcs/mono and
	running on mint and mono.  Runs on mint, but not mono.

2002-05-28  Daniel Morgan <danmorg@sc.rr.com>

	* Mono.Data.MySql
	* Mono.Data.MySql/Mono.Data.MySql: add directories
	for the Mono.Data.MySql assembly and namespace.  This
	will contain the MySql .NET Data Provider which will use
	C# bindings to libMySQL
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql/Test.cs: added file to
	test the C# bindings to MySQL
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySql.cs
	* Mono.Data.MySql/Field.cs: added files
	for the beginnings of C# bindings to MySQL
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql/makefile: added file
	to build the MySQL C# bindings on csc/Microsoft.NET
	
	These C# bindings to the MySQL libMySQL.dll were created by
	Brad Merrill <zbrad@cybercom.net> 
	and can be downloaded from
	http://www.cybercom.net/~zbrad/DotNet/MySql/
	and put into the Mono Class Library under the X11/MIT License
	with Brad Merril's permission.
