	* makefile.gnu: added makefile for linux build.

	* list: updated to contain all missing files.

	* Mono.Data.MySql/makefile: removed unneeded makefile.

	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlDataReader.cs: added
	  started implementing Reader for MySQL provider
	  
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlTypes.cs: added
	  to hold internal helper methods, enums, structs, classes
	  for handling MySQL data types

	* Test/TestMySqlExecuteReader.cs
	* Test/TestMySqlExecuteScalar.cs: added simple tests
	  for ExecuteScalar() and ExecuteReader() methods
	  in MySqlCommand.  We are able to retrieve data
	  from MySQL now.

	* Mono.Data.MySql.build: took out exclude
      so MySqlExecuteReader.cs will build
      
    * Mono.Data.MySql/Field.cs: added enum to file
      and added helper methods field flags
      
    * Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlCommand.cs: started
      implementation of ExecuteScalar nd ExecuteReader methods
      to retrieve data.  Also, added internal method rowVal
      for marshalling field data.
      
    * Mono.Data.MySql/Test.cs: take out a bunch of
      Console.WriteLines'

	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlCommand.cs: modified
	rowsRetrieved should be rowsAffected in ExecuteNonQuery
	because the number is only to show the rows affected
	by an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE; anything else, the
	number is -1
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql/Test.cs: modified
	enable retrieving the results from a query.  even though
	this still does not work for some reason, i thought
	i would enable it so others could see the problem.

	* Mono.Data.MySql.build: modified
	need to copy Mono.Data.MySql.dll to mcs/class/System.Data/Test
	so the SqlSharpCli test program can use MySql too

	* Test/TestMySqlInsert.cs: added test
	to do an SQL INSERT to insert a row into table.
	Works on cygwin compiled using mcs and mono and
	runs on mint, but it fails running on mono.
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlCommand.cs
	* Mono.Data.MySql/TODOAttribute.cs
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySqlConnection.cs: added
	
	* list: added
	so can build with mcs/mono on linux
	I only tested it on Cygwin though.
	To work on linux, the library name in the pinvokes
	in MySql.cs will need to be changed.
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql.build: modified
	exclude files from build.  also copy Mono.Data.MySql.dll
	to Mono.Data.MySql so you can build and run Test.cs
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySql.cs: modified
	tweaks to compile under mcs/mono and run under mint or mono.
	Runs under mint, but not mono. Had to comment out 
	mysql_thread_begin/mysql_thread_end functions because they refused
	to load in mono.  Until this is fixed, a memory leak will occur.
	Can not retrieve field data from MySQL because the PtrToStructure()
	needs to be implemented in System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal class.
	However, this will be very complicated to do.  So, we connect to
	MySQL and execute SQL Commands,	but we can not do Queries yet.
		
	* Mono.Data.MySql/Test.cs: modified
	tweaks to test C# bindings with compiling mcs/mono and
	running on mint and mono.  Runs on mint, but not mono.

2002-05-28  Daniel Morgan <danmorg@sc.rr.com>

	* Mono.Data.MySql
	* Mono.Data.MySql/Mono.Data.MySql: add directories
	for the Mono.Data.MySql assembly and namespace.  This
	will contain the MySql .NET Data Provider which will use
	C# bindings to libMySQL
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql/Test.cs: added file to
	test the C# bindings to MySQL
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql/MySql.cs
	* Mono.Data.MySql/Field.cs: added files
	for the beginnings of C# bindings to MySQL
	
	* Mono.Data.MySql/makefile: added file
	to build the MySQL C# bindings on csc/Microsoft.NET
	
	These C# bindings to the MySQL libMySQL.dll were created by
	Brad Merrill <zbrad@cybercom.net> 
	and can be downloaded from
	http://www.cybercom.net/~zbrad/DotNet/MySql/
	and put into the Mono Class Library under the X11/MIT License
	with Brad Merril's permission.
