	* System.Web.Script.Services/LogicalTypeInfo.cs: Invoke does not
	convert context to System.Object.
	If context is descendant from JavaScriptSerializer.LazyDictionary
	it is converted to a regular Dictionary <string, object> before
	passing to the service method.

	* System.Web.Script.Serialization/JavaScriptSerializer.cs:
	correctly handle members which have an interface as their return
	type - several known interfaces are converted to implementing
	types.

	* Test/System.Web.Script.Serialization/JavaScriptSerializerTest.cs:
	marked several of the JavaScriptSerializer tests as not
	working. Experiments show that the tests are invalid as they relay
	on behavior which is different to .NET's.

	* System.Web.Script.Serialization/JavaScriptSerializer.cs:
	GetConverter now checks whether the requested type is descendant
	from the type supported by teh converter.

	* Test/System.Web.UI/ScriptBehaviorDescriptorTest.cs,
	Test/System.Web.UI/ScriptComponentDescriptorTest.cs,
	Test/System.Web.UI/ScriptControlDescriptorTest.cs: disabled
	tests relying on the Dictionary keys order.
