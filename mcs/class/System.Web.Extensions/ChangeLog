2008-09-17  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* System.Web.Extensions.dll.sources: added
	System.Web.Script.Serialization/Json.cs,
	System.Web.Script.Serialization/JsonSerializer.cs and
	System.Web.Script.Serialization/StringBuilderExtensions.cs

	* System.Web.Script.Serialization/Json.cs: helper class to invoke
	de/serializer.

	* System.Web.Script.Serialization/JsonSerializer.cs: new
	implementation of Json serializer that is free of issues found in
	the old one (and faster + simpler).

	* System.Web.Script.Serialization/JavaScriptSerializer.cs: staging
	transition to the new Json (de)serializer. For now deserialization
	is done using the old JSON code, serialization uses the new
	serializer.

	* System.Web.Script.Serialization/StringBuilderExtensions.cs: a
	set of simple StringBuilder extension methods which check the size
	of the builder against some value and throw an exception if the
	value is exceeded.

2008-09-13  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* System.Web.Extensions.dll.sources :
	  added sys.web.DynamicData types.

2008-08-30  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* System.Web.Script.Serialization/JavaScriptSerializer.cs: if the
	target type is an IDictionary with value type of System.Object,
	make sure to NOT convert any values.
	Any values descendant from JavaScriptSerializer.LazyDictionary are
	converted to Dictionary <string, object>

2008-08-28  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* System.Web.Script.Services/LogicalTypeInfo.cs: Invoke does not
	convert context to System.Object.
	If context is descendant from JavaScriptSerializer.LazyDictionary
	it is converted to a regular Dictionary <string, object> before
	passing to the service method.

	* System.Web.Script.Serialization/JavaScriptSerializer.cs:
	correctly handle members which have an interface as their return
	type - several known interfaces are converted to implementing
	types.

2008-08-22  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* Test/System.Web.Script.Serialization/JavaScriptSerializerTest.cs:
	marked several of the JavaScriptSerializer tests as not
	working. Experiments show that the tests are invalid as they relay
	on behavior which is different to .NET's.

	* System.Web.Script.Serialization/JavaScriptSerializer.cs:
	GetConverter now checks whether the requested type is descendant
	from the type supported by teh converter.

2008-06-11  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* Test/System.Web.UI/ScriptBehaviorDescriptorTest.cs,
	Test/System.Web.UI/ScriptComponentDescriptorTest.cs,
	Test/System.Web.UI/ScriptControlDescriptorTest.cs: disabled
	tests relying on the Dictionary keys order.

2008-05-07  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* ChangeLog: added and moved entries from ../ChaneLog to here.

	* Makefile (RESOURCE_FILES): partially revert r102022 - always use
	the 3.5.0.0 script library. Fixes bug #384580

2008-04-29  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* System.Web.Extensions/Makefile (EXTRA_DISTFILES): include all
	the Microsoft AJAX library scripts in the dist tarball.

2008-04-28  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* System.Web.Extensions/Makefile (RESOURCE_FILES): for the 2.0
	profile use the 1.0.61025.0 scripts.
