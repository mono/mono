	* JsonSerializer.cs: StringBuilder extension methods aren't used
	anymore, changed to calls to static methods in
	StringBuilderExtensions.

	* StringBuilderExtensions.cs: cannot use extension methods here
	because this file is also used in the version 1.0 build which
	doesn't reference System.Core

	* JsonDeserializer.cs: object can contain more than one unquoted
	keys.

	* JavaScriptSerializer.cs: removed the LazyDictionary class, it's
	not needed anymore.

	* JsonSerializer.cs: "SerializeGenericDictionary" is an instance method,
	fix retrieval of its MethodInfo.
	Initialize serializeGenericDictionaryMethods (lazily).
	Add and use GetClosedIDictionaryBase to also handle cases where a
	non-generic class implements a closed IDictionary<,> (e.g.
	SomeDictionary : IDictionary<string, object>). Fixes bug #424704.
	First check for IDictionary<,>, then for IDictionary.

	* JsonDeserializer.cs: added support for stand-alone NaN, Infinity
	and -Infinity values, as well as the same within an array.

2008-09-19  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* Json.cs: added new Serialize overload which takes a TextWriter
	for its output parameter.
	Added Deserialize methods.

	* JsonSerializer.cs: made InitialJavaScriptDateTicks internal.
	Added new Serialize overload which takes a TextWriter for its
	output parameter.
	Added WriteValue overloads for float and double - they must not be
	converted to strings as IConvertibles because their Max/MinValue
	end up converted incorrectly.

	* JavaScriptSerializer.cs: adjustments for the new JSON
	(de)serializer.

	* JsonDeserializer.cs: new JSON deserializer code, fully compliant
	with the .NET AJAX one.
