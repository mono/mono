	type, make sure to call pre-application start methods.

	* HttpServerUtility.cs: Execute checks whether
	IAsyncResult.AsyncWaitHandle is not null before attempting to use
	it. Fixes bug #604502

2010-05-06  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* PreApplicationStartMethodAttribute.cs: added. New 4.0 type.

	* HttpUtility.cs: HtmlEncode, UrlEncode changes for 4.0

	the GetNamedPermissionSet method.

	* HttpResponse.cs: implemented the following 4.0 methods:
	RedirectPermanent, RedirectToRoute, RedirectToRoutePermanent and
	RemoveOutputCacheItem.
	Output property no longer lazily creates a writer object - it's
	created in the internal constructors. If a user sets it to null,
	it remains null for good or bad.
	Added Output setter for 4.0+

2010-05-05  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	exceptions.

2010-04-21  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: update to fix for bug #572469 - ProcessError
	clears the error after handler return only if stop_processing is
	true. Also, stop_processing is never set before calling ProcessError

2010-04-02  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpException.cs: handle situations when current exception is an
	instance of a class derived from HttpException and there's no
	InnerException.

	* HttpApplication.cs: ProcessError must call ClearError on the
	current context after the handler returns without error. Fixes bug
	#572469

2010-03-30 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* HttpResponseStream.cs: speed up short writes.

2010-03-20  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	Cache child nodes in the ChildNodes property.

2010-03-06  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	Added new internal property, PathNoValidation, which returns
	request path without validating it.
	Implemented 4.0 extensible validation.

	* HttpApplication.cs: Pipeline () validates the request path, if
	new validation mode is enabled, before doing anything else.
	Added a generic LoadType overload which checks whether the loaded
	type, if any, derives from the type specified in the method's
	specialization.

	* HttpUtility.cs: decode entities which use hexadecimal
	encoding. Fixes bug #585992. Patch from Sebastien Morin
	<smsisko@gmail.com>, thanks!

2010-03-04  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRuntime.cs: do less work in the static constructor. Most of
	the code was moved to System.Web.Util.RuntimeHelpers. Properties
	which have been moved: MonoVersion, RunningOnWindows,
	CaseInsensitive, IsDebuggingEnabled

2010-02-27  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRuntime.cs: added internal property DomainUnloading.

	* HttpApplication.cs: when app domain is unloading, catch
	ThreadAbortExceptions and reset the abort.

2010-02-03  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: GetOutputCacheProviderName returns the value
	of OutputCache.DefaultProviderName

	* HttpRuntime.cs: internal cache is used to hold the dependencies
	now.

2010-01-20  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpContext.cs: implemented the 4.0 SetSessionStateBehavior
	method

	* HttpCacheVaryByContentEncodings.cs, HttpCacheVaryByHeaders.cs,
	HttpCacheVaryByParams.cs : parameterless constructors are public
	in 4.0

	GetOutputCacheProviderName method

2010-01-19  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* StaticSiteMapProvider.cs: AddNode checks the url of node
	returned by FindSiteMapNode to see if it indeed was a
	duplicate. It is necessary if application derives from
	StaticSiteMapProvider and overrides FindSiteMapNode to return
	RootNode if rawUrl doesn't match any existing node. Fixes bug
	#570194

2010-01-09  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* VirtualPathUtility.cs: small optimizations for GetDirectory

2009-11-23  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: PathInfo returns an empty string when worker
	request is absent or its GetPathInfo method returns a null. Patch
	from Tiaan <tagdev@gmail.com>, thanks!

2009-11-19  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* VirtualPathUtility.cs: made Normalize internal

2009-11-16  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpContext.cs: RewritePath now treats non-rooted and
	app-relative paths correctly - the former are formed by
	concatenating base virtual path with the passed file path and the
	latter by calling VirtualPathUtility.ToAbsolute. Rooted and
	absolute paths are left unmodified. Fixes bug #550103

2009-11-13  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: added parameter checks to Redirect ().
	If the passed url starts with http:, https:, file: or ftp: then it
	is treated as a fully qualified one and no attempt to rewrite the
	url to the fully qualified form (if system.web/httpRuntime
	UseFullyQualifiedRedirectUrl is true) is made.

2009-11-09  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpCookie.cs: made HttpCookie.CookieNVC serializable. Patch
	from Sean Foy <sean.foy+novell@gmail.com>, thanks! Fixes bug
	#553063

	* HttpCookieCollection.cs: Add allows for duplicate cookie
	names. Fixes bug #553150

2009-10-30  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: added internal property ClientFilePath, which
	may have a different value than FilePath when virtual path has
	been rewritten, but the caller specified that the client paths
	should still be constructed using the original url.

	* HttpContext.cs: RewritePath always sets Request.FilePath,
	Request.ClientFilePath is set only when setClientFilePath is
	true. This makes client urls work correctly when url rewriting is
	being used.

2009-10-20  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: implemented the WriteSubstitution method,
	thus enabling post-cache substitution.

2009-10-12  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: actually _use_ the url passed to Redirect when
	fully qualified redirect url is requested, doh. Fixes bug #542846

2009-10-07 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* StaticFileHandler.cs: it's the last flush even when a VPP is used.

2009-10-07  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* TraceData.cs: make long execution times stand out.

2009-09-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* HttpUtility.cs: Do not use CAS Attributes when using MonoTouch.

	Remove unnecesasry using clause.

2009-09-29  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: use full url in redirect if
	UseFullyQualifiedRedirectUrl is set to true in httpRuntime
	configuration section. Patch from Brett Kiefer
	<brett@fogcreek.com>, thanks! Fixes bug #542846

2009-09-28  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpContext.cs: GetResourceProvider - renamed the 'key' argument
	to 'virtualPath' in order to reflects its purpose better. Local
	resource providers are created for the passed virtualPath and not
	for the current request's path. Fixes bug #542484

2009-09-25  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* StaticSiteMapProvider.cs: MapUrl must normalize paths. Fixes bug
	#541969

	* XmlSiteMapProvider.cs: siteMapFile parameter must be mapped in
	Initialize. Fixes bug #541969

2009-09-24  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* XmlSiteMapProvider.cs: added "securityTrimmingEnabled" to the
	list of supported attributes in Initialize. Fixes bug #541607

2009-09-07  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpContext.cs: when creating local resource provider, pass the
	current file's virtual path to CreateLocalResourceProvider. Fixes
	bug #536757

	* XmlSiteMapProvider.cs: do not allow the provider to be
	intialized more than once.
	Initialize throws if it finds unknown attributes in the
	'attributes' collection.
	AddNode checks its arguments and throws if they are null or aren't
	from the same provider.
	FindStartingNode throws exceptions in several erroneous situations
	now.
	Added private method GetConfigDocument which performs several
	checks on the source .sitemap file and throws exceptions if it
	finds any errors.
	BuildSiteMap clears provider state before building the map.
	BuildSiteMapRecursive correctly deals with custom providers. Fixes
	bug #465696
	FindSiteMapNode maps url before searching. Fixes bug #465696

	* VirtualPathUtility.cs: Combine a bit more efficient

	* StaticSiteMapProvider.cs: FindSiteMap node checks if rawUrl is
	relative to application root and if yes, makes it absolute.
	MapUrl converts both rooted and not rooted urls to absolute.

	* SiteMapProvider.cs: check if HttpContext.Request exists before
	using it in FindSiteMapnode

	* SiteMap.cs: Providers collection must be read-only.

2009-09-04  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRuntime.cs: retrieve real Mono version from the runtime and
	store it in the MonoVersion internal static property.

	* VirtualPath.cs: Added new constructor which takes virtual and
	physical paths as well as a boolean marking the instance as
	referring to a fake location. Part of fix for bug #463813

2009-07-28 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: allow subclasses of EventHandler for
	event handlers in global.asax.
	Fixes bug #525743.

2009-07-23  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpException.cs: if an exception is processed which refers to
	internal "files", don't show the internal name.

2009-07-18  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpContext.cs: GetGlobalResourceObject must look for resources
	in the 'Resources' "namespace" - it was a regression from the
	previous change to that method.

2009-07-15  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: added internal methods to
	enable/disable specific watchers. Part of fix for bug #522017

2009-07-14 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* ApplicationShutdownReason.cs: add new 3.5 value.

	Patch from Daniel Gagne.

2009-07-14  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: OnFileChanged doesn't reload
	application if reload suppression is active.

2009-07-13  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: LoadType - wrap call to LoadTypeFromBin in
	try/catch so that we can decide whether or not to throw
	exceptions. LoadTypeFromBin - ignore the FileLoadException and
	BadImageException exceptions as they don't matter in this
	context.

2009-07-13  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HttpResponseStream.cs: Added argument checks to Write. Modified
	methods/properties that requires a readable stream to throw
	NotSupportedException instead of InvalidOperationException for
	compatibility with MS.

2009-07-09 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: use GetSection instead of
	OpenWebConfiguration+GetSection.

2009-07-09  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpContext.cs: fall back to default resource provider factory
	if the factory provided by user doesn't have the required object
	in Get{Global,Local}ResourceObject. Fixes bug #520397
	Refactored the GetResourceObject method and the
	ResourceManagerCacheKey class to DefaultResourceProvider.

2009-07-07 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* ParserError.cs: add 3 missing setters. Patch from Daniel Gagne.

2009-06-15  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpCachePolicy.cs: SetHeaders adds max-age when MaxAge is set
	to TimeSpan.Zero by calling SetMaxAge. Fixes bug #513000

2009-06-05  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* VirtualPathUtility.cs: IsValidVirtualPath no longer uses
	WebConfigurationManager.GetSection to retrieve the verification
	setting. Instead, the setting is retrieved in the static
	constructor.

	* HttpRequest.cs: ApplyUrlMapping must not use
	WebConfigurationManager.GetSection as it would cause a recursive
	call loop. Code to detect whether url mappings are in effect has
	been moved to a static constructor.

2009-06-04  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: version header configuration is read lazily
	now.

	* HttpException.cs: do not show version info if custom errors are
	in effect. Fixes bug #509092
	Don't generate trace for 403. Fixes bug #509092

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: OnFileChanged ignores the directory
	part of the file triggering the event. Fixes bug #509998

2009-06-03  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* VirtualPathUtility.cs: IsValidVirtualPath now checks the value
	of the
	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ASP.NET\VerificationCompatibility
	registry key when running on Windows and also consults the
	mono-specific system.web/monoSettings configuration section to see
	what is the verificationCompatibility property set to. If either
	of the two is set to 1, Mono will not verify the validity of
	the current request's path. Fixes bug #509163

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: OnFileChanged must check whether the
	modified location is a directory before it decides to ignore it
	when watcher's filter is "?eb.?config". Fixes bug #509450 (see
	also bug #495011)

	* HttpForbiddenHandler.cs: updated the error message to match
	.NET, added requested path and description. Fixes bug #509092

	* HttpException.cs: if trace is not requested, don't output <!--
	following the version information in WriteFileBottom. Fixes bug
	#509475
	GetDefaultErrorMessage appends trace only if showTrace is
	true. Fixes bug #509092

2009-06-02  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: LocateHandler needs to pass current request
	path and filepath to WebConfigurationManager when retrieving
	system.web/httpHandlers section as only this will guarantee that
	any <location> elements relating to the current request's which
	contain system.web/httpHandlers section will be correctly read and
	used. Also fixes reading httpHandlers section if it's found in
	web.config located in a subdirectory. Fixes bug #509069

	* HttpException.cs: 403 errors get same treatment as 404
	below. Fixes bug #509092

2009-06-01  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpException.cs: if custom errors are enabled and the error
	code is 404 show the "standard" 404 error message instead of the
	default custom error mode one. Fixes bug #508649

2009-05-28  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpUtility.cs: fixed UrlDecode for encoded strings which
	should be converted to byte sequences longer than 2 bytes. Fixes
	bug #507666

2009-05-14  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: LocateHandler won't cache if a default
	handler was returned.

2009-05-07 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* MimeTypes.cs: add silverlight related types.

2009-04-28 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* HttpContext.cs:
	* HttpWorkerRequest.cs:
	* HttpRuntime.cs: if other parts of the system are using the
	threadpool and we queue requests, once the threadpool is free we
	might still not get back to use it to the maximum extent possible.
	Adding a few more calls to QueuePendingRequest ensures that does not
	happen.

2009-04-24  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HtmlizedException.cs: make HtmlException derive from
	HttpException. System.Web.Mvc relies upon compile and parse
	exception being descendants of HttpException or otherwise it will
	catch and ignore compilation/parsing errors.

2009-04-16  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpContext.cs: local resources code now uses the custom
	resource provider factory, just like the global resources
	code. Fixes bug #493263

2009-04-15  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: if a notification is received from a
	FileSystemWatcher which was configured to watch for
	subdirectories, uses a filter (currently we have just one such
	watcher - waiting for changes to '?eb.?onfig') and the event
	doesn't match the filter, ignore the event. Fixes bug #495011

2009-04-13 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* HttpUtility.cs: the collection returned from ParseQueryString knows
	how to convert the key/value pairs to a string.

2009-04-10 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* HttpResponseStream.cs: use the unsafe version when copying buffers.

2009-04-06  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRuntime.cs: added a new internal static property
	IsDebuggingEnabled

	* HttpContext.cs: IsDebuggingEnabled now calls
	HttpRuntime.IsDebuggingEnabled

2009-04-03  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HttpRuntime.cs: Avoid ANE on Windows when HttpRuntime is used
	outside of ASP.NET. Fixed compiler warning by setting
	assemblyMappingEnabled.

2009-04-02  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpException.cs: if there are more lines with errors, display
	them all.

2009-03-31  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: use glob patterns to watch for
	changes to global.asax and web.config files.
	Set up recursive watch on web.config in a separate thread, to
	minimize application startup delay. Fixes bug #490497

	* VirtualPath.cs: added code to detect whether the VirtualPath
	instance represents a fake virtual path (IsFake property).
	Added new property DirectoryNoNormalize which returns
	non-normalized directory for the VirtualPath instance.
	Made ToString () a bit more friendly and well-behaved.

2009-03-26  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpWorkerRequest.cs: use a generic dictionary to keep header
	names in 2.0+.
	GetKnown{Request,Response}HeaderIndex doesn't use the switch
	anymore.

	* HttpResponse.cs: WriteHeaders now checks whether a header to be
	sent is a known one or not and uses the appropriate method to send
	that header. Partial fix for bug #488702

2009-03-25 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: ClearHeaders() also resets cacheability.
	Bug #485557 fixed.

2009-03-21  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: added two missing 3.0+ properties -
	SubStatusCode and TrySkipIisCustomErrors.

2009-03-04  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRuntime.cs: do not clean the dynamic base directory in
	DoUnload, it can cause race conditions.

2009-03-03  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: fully implemented the Headers property.
	It is also used in the 1.1 profile, but is internal.

	* HttpCookie.cs: GetCookieHeader renamed to GetCookieHeaderValue -
	now returns a string with the header value.

	* HttpCacheVaryByParams.cs: GetResponseHeader renamed to
	GetResponseHeaderValue - now returns a string with the header
	value.

	* HttpCachePolicy.cs: SetHeaders now takes a NameValueCollection
	instead of an ArrayList

	* HttpRequest.cs: avoid calculating the same value twice in
	MakeInputStream

2009-03-02 Everaldo Canuto <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: Headers property implementation.

	to avoid a few locks.

2009-01-29  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: optimize lock usage.

2009-01-23 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	Handle timeouts for OutputPage() too.

2009-01-23 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: set/reset the context for the application
	when creating/disposing. Dispose() out of the lock.

2009-01-24  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: if there are any *.browser files in
	App_Data/Mono_Machine_Browsers/, use those instead of the default
	machine browser files.  This allows app developers to workaround
	limitations with Mono's default browser files without causing
	incompatibilities with MS's implementation.

2009-01-09  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpContext.cs: RewritePath now treats relative and absolute
	file paths with more care. If a path is of the ~/file.aspx form,
	then the ~/ part is removed and the rest is combined with the base
	virtual path. If the file path is of the ~ or /file.aspx forms,
	then it is combined verbatim with the base virtual path. Fixes bug
	#463964
	Make sure the path returned from HttpRequest.BaseVirtualPath
	contains the trailing slash before combining. Fixes bug #463964

2008-12-25 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* ServerVariablesCollection.cs: use IndexOf (char).

2008-12-24  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: watch for changes to web.config also
	in the subdirectories.

2008-12-20  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: the code in TransmitFile (VirtualFile, bool)
	was an abomination - dear children, don't do this at home (never,
	ever, allocate a buffer to load entire file). I will wear a brown
	paper bag every 2nd Sunday in the next 6 months for writing the
	old version of this code.
	New code optimizes the write when DefaultVirtualFile is used (as
	it refers to a physical file on disk) and reads/writes other
	virtual files in chunks.

2008-12-16  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* StaticFileHandler.cs: use HttpRuntime.RunningOnWindows instead
	of checking the platform directly.

2008-12-09  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpServerUtility.cs: when Execute finishes, clear
	Request.QueryStringRaw. Backport of r121010 by Vladimir Krasnov.

2008-12-03  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NoParamsInvoker.cs:
	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: Fixed support for static eventhandlers.

2008-11-25 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* HttpContext.cs: MS does not throw. They just return null.

2008-11-24  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRuntime.cs: take PlatformID.MacOSX into account when
	determining whether we're running on Windows or not. Possible fix
	for #447874

2008-11-21  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpParseException.cs, HtmlizedException.cs: added
	deserialization constructor.

2008-10-31  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpContext.cs: RewritePath correctly rewrites paths for cases
	when application is running under a virtual directory different to
	'/'. Fixes bug #371581
	RewritePath checks the passed virtual path for validity.

	* HttpRequest.cs: MapPath now uses
	VirtualPathUtility.IsValidVirtualPath.

	* VirtualPathUtility.cs: made Canonize () internal.
	Added a new method - IsValidVirtualPath () which checks whether a
	passed path contains only characters allowed for virtual paths.

2008-10-22  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: use only the first matching method in
	GetApplicationTypeEvents, since it will be the one coming from the
	topmost type. Partial fix for bug #437691

2008-10-21  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: if context.Session is null in get_Session,
	throw an exception. Fixes bug #437289

	* CapabilitiesLoader.cs: seal BrowserData.
	Seal CapabilitiesLoader.
	Do not lock on typeof (CapabilitiesLoader) in GetCapabilities ().

2008-10-16  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: when looking up application type
	event handlers (the Application_* methods), look deep in the
	parent chain - we must support private handler methods in base
	types as well.

2008-10-15  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: CacheabilityUpdatedEvent is no longer
	used. cached_response is allocated only when the IsCached property
	is assigned the 'true' value. 

	* HttpCachePolicy.cs: CacheabilityUpdatedEvent is no longer used,
	removed all the traces of it. SetCacheability should not switch
	output caching on.

2008-10-12  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HttpResponse.cs: Simplify code for outputting ASP.NET version, as
	version header cannot be configured. MS corrected this documenation
	error in .NET 2.0 SDK.

2008-10-03 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: make sure we release the resources used by the
	request and/or the response at the end of the request.
	Fixes bug #430040.

2008-10-01  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* BrowserCapabilities.cs: IsBrowser needs to compare browser names
	case insensitively.

2008-09-29  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: do not assume the passed IAsyncResult is a
	is a valid object in async_handler_complete_cb. Fixes bug #430488

2008-09-28  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: Make sure the result of the multiplications are
	longs (not integers casted into longs since they could overflow).
	[Found using Gendarme's ReviewCastOnIntegerMultiplicationRule]

2008-09-23  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpWorkerRequest.cs: implemented a SendCalculatedContentLength
	overload. This method apparently does nothing in MS.NET.

2008-09-16  Juraj Skripsky  <js@hotfeet.ch>

	* HttpServerUtility.cs (UrlDecode, UrlEncode): Respect request/response
	encoding. Fixes bug #426539.

2008-08-29  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: do not cache handlers which aren't
	reusable.

2008-08-20  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpResponseHeader.cs: encode header values if
	httpRuntime.enableHeaderChecking is true (default). Fixes bug
	#418620

2008-08-13  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpException.cs: do not use StringBuilder.AppendFormat when
	there is no need.

2008-08-08  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* XmlSiteMapProvider.cs: a better bugfix for bug #412495.
	Do not call RootNode within BuildSiteMap, as it induces
	recursion. Fixes bug #415685.

2008-07-29  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: if the FilePath contains embedded cookie-less
	session identifier, remove it before computing the base virtual
	directory. Fixes bug #397418

2008-07-28  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* XmlSiteMapProvider.cs: set the base ResourceKey to the name of
	our associated site map file, so that localization works
	correctly. Fixes bug #412493
	Do not add the root node retrieved from BuildSiteMapRecursive in
	BuildMap, if the node is already the current root node. Fixes bug
	#412495

2008-07-26  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HttpCachePolicy.cs: Only add Expires header if expire date is
	actually set. Removed extra tabs and regions. Code formatting.

2008-07-23  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: do not register handlers for
	BeginRequest/EndRequest when called from within the
	Application_Start handler. Fixes bug #411213

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: let the application know we're
	running the Application_Start handler so that it can suppress
	registering some events from inside that handler (see bug
	#381971). Fixes bug #411213

2008-06-30  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRuntime.cs, HttpApplication.cs: hush the warnings

	* HttpContext.cs: GetGlobalObjectFromFactory caches the
	ResourceManager objects now. Patch from Zoltan Varga
	<vargaz@gmail.com>, thanks!
	The GetGlobalObjectFromFactory caches are thread local to avoid
	locking.
	GetResourceObject ResourceManager cache is now a thread local
	Dictionary to avoid cloning.
	Hush the warnings.

2008-06-27  Robert Jordan  <robertj@gmx.net>

	* HttpCachePolicy.cs: map default HttpCacheability to
	"Cache-control: private" for MS.NET compatibility.
	Fixes bug #404083. Contributed by
	Hubert FONGARNAND <informatique.internet@fiducial.fr>.

2008-06-21  Robert Jordan  <robertj@gmx.net>

	* HttpRuntime.cs (.cctor): Workaround for bug #402263.

2008-06-19  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* MimeTypes.cs: added a mime type entry for .xpi files.

2008-06-18  Juraj Skripsky  <js@hotfeet.ch>

	* HttpResponse.cs (AddHeadersNoCache): Add "X-AspNet-Version" header if
	enabled.

2008-06-16  Noam Lampert  <noaml@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpContext.cs: improve support for RewritePath

2008-06-10  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRuntime.cs: do not create a new thread to run the
	application, reuse the thread from the hosting application (XSP's
	thread comes from threadpool).

2008-06-06  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* SiteMap.cs: FindCurrentNode is no longer needed. CurrentNode
	uses Provider.CurrentNode to find the return value.
	AddNode doesn't throw a duplicate key exception for nodes not
	belonging to the current provider.
	Check whether keys exist before removing entries from the
	dictionaries.

	* XmlSiteMapProvider.cs: implemented support for child providers
	(the AddProvider method). FindSiteMapNode* methods look for the
	node also in the collection of child providers. Fixes bug #397040

2008-06-04  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: correctly modify virtual path to include the
	session ID in cookieless session mode. Fixes bug #396628.

	* HttpServerUtility.cs: remove session hash from the URL if in the
	cookieless mode. Fixes bug #396628.

	* HttpRequest.cs: make sure that BaseVirtualDir always returns
	some value.

2008-06-02  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>
	
	* HttpRuntime.cs: Thanks to Christian Hergert for finding this
	one.  

	Do not throw NIEX on IsOnUNCShare, instead compute the value. 

2008-05-30  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>
	
	* HttpApplication.cs, HttpCachePolicy.cs, SiteMapProvider.cs,
	TraceContext.cs: do not use synthetized event accessors (to avoid
	locks).

2008-05-19 Noam Lampert <noaml@mainsoft.com>

        * HttpServerUtility.cs: Fix bug in UrlPathEncode when URL contains '?' 

2008-05-12 Noam Lampert <noaml@mainsoft.com>

        * HttpApplication.cs: Fix regressions introduced by latest commit

2008-05-07 Gonzalo Panigua Javier <gonzalo.mono@gmail.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: create a fake context while loading the
	modules on the first request so that the modules don't mess up
	with the actual output of that request.

2008-05-07  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: StripPath should handle UNC paths too. Fixes bug
	#385870. Patch from Ivan Hamilton <ivan@chimerical.com.au>,
	thanks!

2008-05-06  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* MimeTypes.cs: mime type keys might not exist in the dictionary,
	in the 2.0 profile. Patch from Rolf Kvinge <rkvinge@novell.com>
	and Jean-Baptiste Evain <jbevain@novell.com>, thanks! Fixes bug
	#386008

2008-04-30  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: when the Start method is called in a new
	thread, the thread's culture and ui culture are set to their
	defaults, thus ignoring whatever their values were in the parent
	thread. This is now fixed by passing an array containing the
	culture values to the Start method, so that the new thread can be
	properly initialized. Fixes bug #323566

	* SiteMapNode.cs: the implicitResourceKey parameter to one of the
	constructors sets the value of the ResourceKey property.
	GetImplicitResourceString uses the provider's ResourceKey as the
	global resource object key and the node's ResourceKey to construct
	the resource name. Fixes bug #323994
	ResourceKey setter throws an InvalidOperationException now, when
	the node is read-only.

2008-04-29  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpException.cs: safe guard against context being null in
	GetHtmlErrorMessage.

2008-04-26  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* VirtualPath.cs: added a new property, PhysicalPath.

2008-04-25  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HttpResponse.cs: Use double quotes in link to match MS.

2008-04-25  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: use Request.CurrentExecutionFilePath when
	querying for the handler. Makes requests work if request path was
	rewritten without modifying the FilePath. Fixes bug #383652

	* HttpContext.cs: set Request.FilePath in RewritePath only if
	setClientFilePath is true. Fixes bug #383652
	Revert the change in revision 100273 - the real bug was in a
	different overload of RewritePath, fixed with the commit for the
	above bug #383652

2008-04-24  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: added a new overload of GetHandler which
	allows the caller to ignore the handler found in the context
	passed to the method.

	* HttpServerUtility.cs: have HttpApplication.GetHandler ignore the
	handler found in the current context when Execute'ing another
	page. Fixes bug #316166

2008-04-23  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* VirtualPath.cs: introduced the CurrentRequestDirectory property,
	which returns the virtual directory for the current request. The
	information is taken from either current request's
	CurrentExecutionFilePath property (if not null) or from the path
	set externally (by setting the property or using the appropriate
	VirtualPath constructor). The new property is used to construct
	the correct absolute virtual path in the MakeRooted method. Fixes
	bug #381715.

	* HttpApplication.cs: events registered from Application_Start are
	silently ignored - any event registered after the one-time
	application initialization is completed, is ignored. Fixes bug
	#381971

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: call app.DisposeInternal instead of
	app.Dispose.

	* HttpContext.cs: Fix bug #371581 for 1.1 as well.

2008-04-19  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpException.cs: don't write the stack trace inside html
	comment if custom errors are enabled.

2008-04-15  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@gmail.com>

	* HttpRuntime.cs: Don't add Date header for error pages either. Fixes bug
	#363404.

2008-04-15  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: dispose of streams the way it should
	be done.

2008-04-14  Igor Zelmanovich <igorz@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpRuntime.cs: refactoring.

2008-04-14  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* XmlSiteMapProvider.cs: FindStartingNode throws an exception when
	it is passed a file which ends in an extension other than
	.sitemap.
	Fixed a check for the siteMapFile attribute presence. Fixes bug
	#379566.

	* SiteMap.cs: FindCurrent node uses the default provider
	exclusively. Fixes bug #379566

2008-04-10  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: compile web references before
	App_Code. Fixes bug #377934

	* MimeTypes.cs: added some missing MIME types. New entries
	contributed by Albert Ritmeester
	<aritmeester@vitalhealthsoftware.nl>, thanks! Fixes bug #372290

2008-04-09  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpContext.cs: make RewritePath work correctly in the 2.0
	profile, fixes bug #371581

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: compile web references. Fixes bug
	#377934

	* VirtualPath.cs: added a method to convert a physical path into a
	virtual one, if the physical path is under the application root.

2008-04-08  Dean Brettle <dean@brettle.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs (CapabilitiesProcessor): changed to
	use etc/mono/2.0/Browser/*.browser files in addition to 
	~/App_Browsers/*.browser files.

2008-04-07  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* VirtualPath.cs: added

2008-04-02  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: make sure QueryStringRaw is always returned with
	a leading '?' and that we return something meaningful even if the
	url components weren't collected before. Fixes bug #376352

2008-04-01  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: set context.Handler to the detected handler
	object before firing application events. Fixes bug #372897

2008-03-31  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* StaticFileHandler.cs: added code to use custom
	VirtualPathProvider, if present, to serve files from virtual
	storage.

	* HttpResponse.cs: added two internal TransmitFile overloads which
	take a VirtualFile as a parameter.

2008-03-27  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: make UrlComponents internal.

	* HttpContext.cs: added support for resource provider factories.

2008-03-13  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: use HttpApplication.BinDirs to
	create watchers for binary application directories.

	* HttpApplication.cs: use HttpRuntime.CaseInsensitive instead of
	own IsRunningOnWindows.
	Remove the BinDirectories enumerator property, replaced with a
	BinDirectory one returning a string with path to the binary
	directory.

	* HttpRuntime.cs: introduce two static properties -
	CaseInsensitive (set to true whenever the environment is
	case-insensitive - i.e. MONO_IOMAP="all" or MONO_IOMAP="case", or
	running on Windows) and RunningOnWindows.

2008-03-12  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: HttpContext.Handler may be set by a module
	in any of the event handlers between acquiring the initial handler
	and processing the request. Honor the setting and use
	HttpContext.Handler instead of the matched one if set.

2008-03-10  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: synchronize Modules and Dispose with
	InitOnce. Should prevent firing module events before the modules
	are fully initialized.

2008-03-09  Dean Brettle <dean@brettle.com> 

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: Added support for detecting 
	App_Browsers/*.browser files and using them to determine capabilities.
	Also restart the app if the App_Browsers, App_Code, or App_GlobalResources
	directories are created.

	* BrowserCapabilities.cs (TagWriter): get value via internal virtual
	GetTagWriter() method, which is overridden in nBrowser.Result.

	* HttpRequest.cs (BrowserMightHaveSpecialWriter, BrowserMightHaveAdapters):
	internal properties added to allow Page and Control methods to avoid
	accessing Request.Browser to get browser-specific HtmlTextWriters or 
	ControlAdapters.  Those things only exist when there are App_Browsers
	files.

2008-03-09  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpUtility.cs: HTML-decode the query string prior to parsing
	it.

2008-03-01  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRuntime.cs: SettingsMappingManager has been moved to
	Mono.Web.

2008-02-28  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpParamsCollection.cs: restore the GetValues overrides only to
	make sure the collections are merged before invoking the base
	implementation. 
	Remove code that's no longer needed.

2008-02-27  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpException.cs: error message output format changes.

2008-02-26  Kornél Pál  <kornelpal@gmail.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: Don't add Date header because servers usually add
	a Date header that would result in duplicate Date header sent to the
	client. Fixes bug #363404.

2008-02-25  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpException.cs: fix a buglet with unfoldable hidden divs which
	contain the full compiler output and the full source code.

	* HttpContext.cs: correctly set the timeout if the user has
	specified a timeout which, when converted to milliseconds yields a
	value larger than one allowed by Timer.Change. This can happen,
	for instance, when HttpServerUtility.ScriptTimeout is set to
	Int32.MaxValue. Previously, when something like that happened, the
	value was converted to 0ms, giving an instantenous timer
	expiration and, what follows, a request "timeout".

2008-02-19  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpParamsCollection.cs: do not override the NVC behavior for
	GetValues - values from different sources (Form, Query, Cookies,
	ServerVariables) must be kept separate for this purpose. This is
	also the behavior of MS.NET. Fixes bug #362189

2008-02-18  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRuntime.cs: When app is offline, send status code 503
	instead of 200. Fixes bug #357565

2008-02-10  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HttpException.cs: Avoid IndexOutOfRangeException when there are no
	error lines.

2008-02-07  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HttpException.cs: Removed CWL.

2008-02-07  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpException.cs: more exception output compatibility changes to
	match MS.NET.

2008-02-07  Vladimir Krasnov  <vladimirk@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpContext.jvm.cs: added CurrentHandlerInternal property

2008-02-07  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpException.cs: moved several strings to constants, for easier
	maintenance. 
	Added 3 new constructors which let the caller to set the exception
	description.
	The Description property is now settable.
	The stack trace at the bottom of the file is written after the
	terminating </html>, inside a HTML comment. Format changed to
	match MS.NET.
	Error 404 is handled in a special way, to match the output with
	MS.NET.

	* HttpContext.cs, StaticFileHandler.cs, HttpApplication.cs: use
	the new HttpException constructor for 404.

2008-02-07  Vladimir Krasnov  <vladimirk@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: fixed AddHeadersNoCache, removed date_header since
	java app server adds it, under TARGET_J2EE.

2008-02-06  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: in FireOnAppEnd, set app_type to null
	after the event has been fired.

	* HttpRuntime.cs: when switching to offline mode fire the
	shutdown events. Fixes bug #357565.
	Watch for Created event in the FileSystemWatcher for the
	app_offline.htm files.

2008-01-29  Vladimir Krasnov  <vladimirk@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: performance optimization of QueryStringRaw

2008-01-27  Igor Zelmanovich <igorz@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: rise PreSendRequestHeaders befire headers_sent 
	initialization to allow set additional headers or status code at 
	PreSendRequestHeaders event handlers.

2008-01-24  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: use BuildManager.GetCompiledType to
	build the application (global.asax) file.

2008-01-22  Konstantin Triger <kostat@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: move headers_sent initialization up to prevent additional
		trial to send headers if an exception is thrown.

2008-01-21  Konstantin Triger <kostat@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: Form validation: ensure the collection is accessible after
		validation failed.

2008-01-16  Juraj Skripsky  <js@hotfeet.ch>

	* HttpRequest.cs (get_UrlReferrer): Handle case when headers contain
	invalid Url for referer.

2008-01-16  Juraj Skripsky  <js@hotfeet.ch>

	* HttpCookieCollection.cs (AllKeys): Use Keys.CopyTo().

2008-01-14  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs, HttpResponse.cs, SiteMapNode.cs, HttpRuntime.cs,
	HttpResponseStream.cs, HttpApplication.cs, HttpCachePolicy.cs:
	speed optimization - use String.Concat instead of String.Format in
	some cases.

2007-12-13 Igor Zelmanovich <igorz@mainsoft.com>
	
	* HttpApplication.cs:
	* HttpContext.cs:
	* HttpRequest.cs:
	* HttpServerUtility.cs:
	- When Transfer/Execute is called with preserveForm=true, transferred 
	page is not processed as PostBack but form collection is preserved.

	setting the output headers. Fixes bugs #334521, #339538

	* TraceData.cs: do not use DataTable for trace data storage
	anymore. Instead, a set of classes is used to hold data and a
	Queue container (generic version in 2.0) is used to hold the data
	rows. Fixes bug #325267.

2007-11-05  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: cope with UriBuilder.Query being null.

2007-11-03  Gert Driesen  <drieseng@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HttpRuntime.cs: Always return a path with trailing directory
	separator character. Spaces to tabs.

2007-11-03  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: removed unused internal PrivateBinPath
	property.

	* HttpRuntime.cs: BinDirectory returns a path that ends with the
	directory separator character.

2007-11-02  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpServerUtility.cs: in 2.0, Transfer is allowed only from
	pages. Fixes bug #334931
	Also, according to MSDN docs, transfer in 2.0+ is possible only to
	other pages.

	* HttpRuntime.cs: BinDirectory returns a full path to the actual
	bin directory in the application root. If no bin directory is
	found, it defaults to returning <applicationPath>/bin. Fixes bug
	338116.

	* HttpApplication.cs: introduced HTTP handler cache to save time
	on repetitive handler collection traversals. On busy sites the
	traversal of the default 26 handlers may account for thousands of
	unnecessary calls to configsystem.LocateHandler method, which may
	also involve executing a regex. The cache is cleared whenever the
	HTTP handler collection is modified.

2007-10-30 Igor Zelmanovich <igorz@mainsoft.com>

	separator. Fixes bug #335615

2007-10-18  Juraj Skripsky  <js@hotfeet.ch>

	* StaticSiteMapProvider.cs: Replace Hashtables by Dictionaries,
	don't allocate them on-demand, there will never be many
	Provider instances around.
	AddNode(): Check for duplicate keys before adding any item to
	hashtables.
	RemoveNode(): Use fact that Hashtable.Remove() never throws,
	remove item from keyToNode as well, make symmetric to AddNode().
	MapUrl(): Use VirtualPathUtility, allow for full urls
	(e.g. http://www.google.com).
	
2007-10-17  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* StaticFileHandler.cs: fixed an bug with Mono running under
	Windows operating systems which caused XSP to return source of the
	requested page if the file name used in the request ended in any
	number of spaces or dots. The problem lies in the way the Win32
	subsystem treats such file names - it ignores the trailing
	characters and allows the calling application to open a file on
	disk even when its name does not contain the trailing characters
	used in the open request. Such file names may be supported by the
	underlying filesystem (e.g. NTFS) but they are not supported by
	the I/O Win32 subsystem. The security issue is reported in
	CVE security report CVE-2007-5473. Fixes bug #332401
	
2007-10-17  Igor Zelmanovich <igorz@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs:
	response status is sent after PreSendRequestHeaders invoked.
	Redirect method set RedirectLocation property
	fixes bug #334521
		
2007-10-15  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	from BinDirectories. Patch from Atsushi Enomoto
	<atsushi@ximian.com>, thanks! Fixes bug #332434. 

2007-10-04  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: call the Init method after loading the
	modules and hooking up application events. Fixes bug #330416.

2007-10-01  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpServerUtility.cs: set a flag when transferring control to
	another page.

	* HttpContext.cs: added an internal InTransit property to carry
	information that HttpServerUtility.Transfer has been used, over to
	the target page.

2007-09-12  Juraj Skripsky <js@hotfeet.ch>

	* StaticSiteMapProvider.cs (AddNode): Add message text to
	InvalidOperationException (duplicate url case).

2007-09-06  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	Last-Modified headers from file dependencies.

	* HttpResponse.cs: implemented file dependency methods.

2007-09-01  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRuntime.cs: rewrote the app_offline.htm support. It now uses
	filesystem watchers instead of checking for existence of the
	file(s) at the beginning of every request. No performance penalty
	that way.

2007-08-31  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: added methods to enable/disable
	watchers.

	* HttpRuntime.cs: implemented handling of app_offline.htm file in
	the application root directory. Fixes bug #81127.

	* HttpResponse.cs: make sure neither context or
	context.ApplicationInstance are null in End ().

2007-08-27  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpCookie.cs: make sure a key is output even if it has no
	values set. Fixes bug #81333.

2007-08-23  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: added a static array BinDirs which contains
	the common bin directory names we can encounter.
	Added internal static property IsRunningOnWindows.
	Added internal enumerable property BinDirectories to iterate over
	the full paths of the available binary directories.
	Added internal enumerable property BinDirectoryAssemblies to
	iterate over .dll files in the bin directories.
	LoadTypeFromPrivateBin renamed to LoadTypeFromBin.
	LoadTypeFromBin uses BinDirectoryAssemblies.
	
	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: use HttpApplication.BinDirectories to
	interate over the list of bin dirs.

2007-08-21  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: watch for changes in all the
	private binary directories for the current application domain.

	* HttpApplication.cs: turn the PrivateBinPath property into an
	internal enumerable, so that code throughout the assembly can
	iterate over the list of private bin directories configured for
	the application domain.
	Added a new internal method LoadTypeFromPrivateBin, for sharing
	with other parts of the assembly.

2007-08-18  Juraj Skripsky <js@hotfeet.ch>

	* HttpRequest.cs (StripPath): Fix off-by-one error, make static.

2007-08-18  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: IE sends the full input file path when uploading
	a file via the upload input control. Detect the situation and
	strip the leading path. Fixes bug #82059.

	* HttpServerUtility.cs: set the current context's path(s) to the
	Transfer/Execute target only to retrieve the new handler, and
	restore them immediately afterwards. It has a two-fold effect:
	first it avoids an extra round trip to the original page which
	called Transfer/Execute, second it makes FilePath etc. return
	information about the original page (that is the one which called
	Transfer/Execute). Fixes bug #82439.

2007-08-14  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* XmlSiteMapProvider.cs: do not hide this_lock.

2007-08-09  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: unconditionally watch for changes
	(including creation) to Global.asax, global.asax, Web.config,
	web.config and Web.Config. This makes the application restart once
	any of those is created. Patch from Juraj Skripsky
	<juraj@hotfeet.ch>, thanks! Fixes bug #82380.

2007-08-08  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* StaticSiteMapProvider.cs, HttpApplicationFactory.cs,
	HttpStaticObjectsCollection.cs, SiteMapProvider.cs,
	XmlSiteMapProvider.cs, HttpApplication.cs, CapabilitiesLoader.cs,
	TimeoutManager.cs: do not use lock (this), replace it with lock
	(this_object), where this_object is an instance	variable. Prevents
	deadlocks in situation when external code locks on the class
	instance.

2007-08-05  Vladimir Krasnov  <vladimirk@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpUtility.cs: performance refactoring, optimized UrlEncode

2007-08-05 Igor Zelmanovich <igorz@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpResponseStream.jvm.cs: optimized CharBucket

2007-07-22  Vladimir Krasnov  <vladimirk@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpServerUtility.cs: fixed Execute, SetCurrentExePath should be 
	called after ApplicationInstance.GetHandler call in case of GetHandler
	fails for some reason

2007-07-21  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRuntime.cs: clean up the dynamic base directory on domain
	shutdown.

2007-07-10  Vladimir Krasnov  <vladimirk@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpUtility.cs: optimized HtmlEncode and HtmlAttributeEncode methods

2007-07-05  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs (AsyncRequestState.Complete): Add the
	try/catch for the callback here to ensure that we only call
	complete_event.Set once. 

	(PipelineDone): This is where the core of the bug fix is: do not
	call Complete() or call done.Set() (depending on the invocation
	case) until we are actually done cleaning up the request.

	The problem was that we signaled that we were done, but we had not
	completed the shut down, so another thread could have been
	scheduled on the same HttpApplication and had its variables be
	modified as we completed the shutdown on the first thread. 

	This fixes #81400 which was a very long standing bug.  

	(Tick): Remove the pipeline check against null, this is not
	necessary and it will help us find problems like this one in the
	future.

	Reverts patch r66072 which was a described as:

		band-aid patch to help debugging hang running 2.0
		tests.

2007-07-02  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* CapabilitiesLoader.cs: provide default capability values for all
	the 2.0+ capabilities which are not defined in our
	browscap.ini. The default values have been assigned as per
	MSDN. Fixes bug #81927

2007-06-28  Vladimir Krasnov  <vladimirk@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: fixed AddHeadersNoCache, removed content-length
	header for TARGET_JVM
	* HttpWorkerRequest.cs: made this class partial, moved TARGET_JVM stuff
	to .jvm part
	* HttpWriter.cs: fixed write methods, output_stream can write char[]
	and string in TARGET_JVM
	added HttpWorkerRequest.jvm.cs, HttpResponseStream.jvm.cs

2007-06-25 Juraj Skripsky <js@hotfeet.ch>

	* HttpUtility.cs: fixed HtmlAttributeEncode, performance improvement

2007-06-20  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRuntime.cs: added new internal property, InternalCache, to
	keep all the internal cache entries instead of mixing them with
	the public cache ones.
	Do not invoke Cache.InvokePrivateCallbacks - this method no longer
	exists.

	* HttpResponse.cs: private entries are now kept in
	Context.InternalCache.

	* HttpContext.cs: added new internal property, InternalCache,
	which returns the HttpRuntime.InternalCache value.

	* HttpApplication.cs: check all the loaded assemblies for the type
	being looked up. Patch from Juraj Skripsky <juraj@hotfeet.ch>,

	* SiteMapProvider.cs: implemented proper logic of authorizing
	user's access to a sitemap node, as per MSDN2 docs. Patch from
	Dumitru Ban <dban@dako.ro>, thanks!

2007-05-30  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* TraceManager.cs: Catch all the possible exceptions in the
	constructor - the object MUST be created successfully (even if
	there are errors).

	* HttpRequest.cs: do not attempt to apply url mappings if the
	configuration manager has errors.

	* HttpRuntime.cs: handle static constructor exceptions later on,
	during the first call to ReallyProcessRequest.

	* QueueManager.cs: provide defaults for the parameters to be read
	from the config file(s).
	Catch all the possible exceptions in the constructor - the object
	MUST be created successfully (even if there are errors).

2007-05-29  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* SiteMapProvider.cs: updated the node accessibility comments.
	If Roles not null and user is not in at least one of the
	specified roles, return false.
	If there Url is null or empty, return false.

2007-05-28  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: since Path is used from within
	WebConfigurationManager, under some conditions it may lead to
	endless recursion if the UrlComponents is not instantiated when
	Path_get is called.

2007-05-21  Vladimir Krasnov  <vladimirk@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpContext.cs: added ProfileInitialized boolean property

	to normalize, performance fix

2007-05-16  Konstantin Triger <kostat@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpContext.cs: correctly check for request locality.

2007-05-15  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: refactoring - moved LoadType from
	WebConfigurationHost here and made it internal static, in order to
	make the code avaliable from all the places where extended type
	loading is required.

2007-05-14  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>
 
	* HttpUtility.cs: when parsing query strings, skip the leading ?
	for the first parameter name.

	* HttpRequest.cs: added support for mapping urls, as defined in
        the system.web/urlMappings section.

2007-05-14  Vladimir Krasnov  <vladimirk@mainsoft.com>
	
	* HttpWriter.cs: GetMaxByteCount was used in Write and WriteString
	methods to improve performance of HttpWriter

2007-05-14 Igor Zelmanovich <igorz@mainsoft.com>

	section is not valid.	

2007-05-08  Vladimir Krasnov  <vladimirk@mainsoft.com>

	* BaseParamsCollection.cs: fixed Get(string) property, fixed collection
	lazy initialization

2007-05-07  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpResponseStream.cs: use BufferOutput

	* HttpResponse.cs: support Buffer, but use BufferOutput

2007-05-03 Igor Zelmanovich <igorz@mainsoft.com>

	* BrowserCapabilities.cs:
	added missing API.	

2007-04-30 Igor Zelmanovich <igorz@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: reverted r74717.

2007-04-29 Igor Zelmanovich <igorz@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpContext.jvm.cs: Response.End() must abort thread if not async.	

2007-04-29 Igor Zelmanovich <igorz@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: doesn't cache httpHandlersSection in instance, 
	that allows to consider httpHandlers section in nested web.config.	

2007-04-27  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* XmlSiteMapProvider.cs: add support for siteMapFile attribute.

2007-04-24  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* CapabilitiesLoader.cs: Hashtables used as property containers
	should not be case-insensitive as we now preload the property
	hashes with default properties, to make the code work in case
	browscap.ini is broken or missing. Instead, the keys are
	lower-cased and trimmed before indexing the Hashtable.
	Added all the missing capabilities to the defaultCaps Hashtable.
	The returned Hashtable is not reversed in GetCapabilities anymore
	- it might make the code faster, but it also makes it mismatch
	browsers (e.g. Firefox 2.0 is mismatched for Mozilla 1.8).
	All of the above fixes bug #81437.

	* HttpRequest.cs: MS.NET throws HttpException for invalid paths,
	not ArgumentNullException.

	* HttpException.cs: wrap GetHtmlErrorMessage internals in
	try/catch to capture possible exceptions in HttpContext.

	* HttpContext.cs: IsCustomErrorEnabled is used from within
	HttpException, make sure it gets the section in a safe way and
	resorts to the default settings.
	
	* HttpResponse.cs: HeaderEncoding is used in the same context as
	above. Take the same precautions.
	
2007-04-22 Joshua Tauberer <jit@occams.info>
 
 	* HttpParamsCollection.cs: Fix IndexOutOfRangeException.

2007-04-10  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpCookie.cs: format the output of HttpCookie.Values.ToString()
	in the same way MS.NET does. Fixes bug #81333. Patch from Mike
	Morano <mmorano@mikeandwan.us>.

	* XmlSiteMapProvider.cs: add the NotifyFilters.Size to the
	watcher flags, so that we watch for modifications to a file when

	it is disposed.
	* HttpRequest.cs: support for writing request data to on-disk

	* StaticSiteMapProvider.cs (AddNode): Add a check to see if node
	== RootNode.  Not sure if this is actually correct, but it's
	required given our implementation of XmlSiteMapProvider.  without
	this check, we end up assigning RootNode.ParentNode == RootNode,
	which makes for an infinite loop when we traverse up the tree.

	Management", page 310.

2006-03-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* SiteMap.cs: clean this up a bunch.  use the SiteMapSection to
	initialize the provider collection, and don't add a provider.

	demand for SerializationFormatter) for 2.0. Fixed line-ending.
	* HttpException.cs: Added LinkDemand and InheritanceDemand (class) for
	Minimal. Renamed parameters to match documentation.
	* HttpParseException.cs: Added LinkDemand (class) for Minimal. Added
	demand for SerializationFormatter on GetObjectData method. Fixed 
	line-ending.
	* HttpRequestValidationException.cs: Added new public ctors and 
	[Serializable] to 2.0. Added LinkDemand for Minimal.
	* HttpUnhandledException.cs: Added new public ctors and [Serializable]
	to 2.0. Removed unused internal ctor. Added LinkDemand for Minimal.
	Fixed line-ending.

2005-09-13  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* HttpResponseSubstitutionCallback.cs: New. 2.0 delegate.
	* TraceContextEventArgs.cs: New. 2.0 class.
	* TraceContextEventHandler.cs: New. 2.0 delegate.

2005-09-13 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: use GetServerName instead of GetLocalAddress when
	building the Url.

2005-09-09 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: fix the indexer.

2005-09-08 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpPostedFile.cs: fixes in Seek and Position.

2005-09-08  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: Make sure the MemoryStream created have their 
	contents marked as public - or else you can't call GetBuffer on them!

2005-09-08  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: Patch from Juraj Skripsky <js@hotfeet.ch> that
	fixes UrlReferrer. 

2005-09-08 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpPostedFile.cs: Make this class actually work. Every time we read,
	we have to position the underlying stream.

2005-09-08 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: reading multipart/form-data works again.

2005-09-08 Eyal Alaluf <eyala@mainsoft.com>
	* HttpRequest.cs: Under TARGET_JVM the input stream must allow GetBuffer.

2005-09-08 Eyal Alaluf <eyala@mainsoft.com>
	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: TARGET_J2EE/JVM fix.

2005-09-07 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: correctly detect multipart/form-data.

2005-09-07 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: recycle after invoking session_end.

2005-09-06 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpRuntime.cs: remove Console.

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: don't hook Session_End, but keep
	the MethodInfo around for later invocation if needed. Don't call
	GetMethods() for every HttpApplication (or derived class) instances.
	Added a method, used by SessionStateModule, that will create use an
	application without context to invoke Session_End. Keep a pool of
	applications that are meant to be used by this method only.

	* HttpApplication.cs: add a SetSession method and do not
	attach all the events if the application is for Session_End only.

2005-09-06 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpRuntime.cs: actually unload the domain when requested. Reformatted
	FinishUnavailable() and removed the 'Location' header form the error.

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: set up the watcher for the bin directory.
	This also prevents a nullref when global.asax is changed.

2005-09-06 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: fixed bug introduced when moving GetHandler call
	around. Now we get error pages again.

2005-09-06  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: Catch EndRequest errors as well.

2005-09-05  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: Invoke EndRequest handler before OutputPage
	as FormsAuthentication will issue a Redirect from the EndRequest 
	handler. 

2005-09-05 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: when writing an error message, catch the possible
	write error.

2005-09-05 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpResponseStream.cs: prevent invalid cast exception if the first
	thing written is a file.

2005-09-04 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: fix invalid cast exception (bug #75926).

2005-09-01 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: only trigger the Application_Start event
	once. It was being invoked more than once when several clients were
	hitting the server at the same time on startup.

2005-09-01 Eyal Alaluf <eyala@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpContext.cs HttpResponse.cs HttpWorkerRequest.cs HttpRuntime.cs
	  HttpApplicationFactory.cs HttpApplication.cs: TARGET_J2EE/JVM fixes.
	  Mostly workaround limited AppModel in TARGET_J2EE.

2005-08-31 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: if the request method is HEAD, that's equivalent to
	SuppressContent. Added an internal TransmitFile that allows setting the
	final_flush flag.
	* StaticFileHandler.cs: use the new internal TransmitFile and remove
	generation of Content-Length header, as now it's computed correctly.
	* HttpApplication.cs: remove debugging stuff.
	* HttpResponseStream.cs: suppress_content is checked in HttpResponse.

2005-08-31  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	Removed debugging info.
	
	* HttpApplication.cs: Add support for async handlers. 

	Add extra 2.x methods. 

2005-08-31 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* BrowserCapabilities.cs: removed extra 'using'.

	* HttpApplication.cs: use just the 'modcoll' to hold the collection of
	modules instead of having a separate 'modules' one.

2005-08-30 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: clone the module collection so that
	it's not shared between HttpApplications. Call GetHandler() in the
	right place.

2005-08-30  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: Add the new 2.x method overloads that take a
	data object.

	(RunHooks): Pass the extra data instead of null.

	* HttpCookie.cs (HttpOnly): Add 2.x cookie header.

	* BrowserCapabilities.cs: Move the core of the capabilities into a
	separate file.  Use partial classes to choose what version to
	compile against.

	* HttpBrowserCapabilities.cs: Update to move the code elsewhere.

2005-08-30 Eyal Alaluf <eyala@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpResponseStream.cs: Fix a bug introduced by last fix (thanks to
	Ben)

2005-08-30 Eyal Alaluf <eyala@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpResponseStream.cs: Compilation fixes for TARGET_JVM. TARGET_JVM
	does not support unsafe code. I localized all unsafe code within Chunk
	& Block and created a managed version of Chunk.

2005-08-30 Eyal Alaluf <eyala@mainsoft.com>
	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: Compilation fixes for TARGET_J2EE. Under
	TARGET_J2EE static fields are shared by all app domains. We handle
	this difference by explicitly getting/setting values from the app
	domain.  Since HttpApplicationFactory has many static fields, I
	refactored it to have one static instance and moved the static fields
	into instance fields.

2005-08-29 Eyal Alaluf <eyala@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: Disable use of IntPtrStream for TARGET_JVM

2005-08-29 Eyal Alaluf <eyala@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpContext.cs: Compilation fixes for TARGET_J2EE/JVM

2005-08-28 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: don't duplicate the 'charset=' and don't send a
	charset for unknown MIME types.
	* StaticFileHandler.cs: set the Content-Length header here.
	* HttpRequest.cs: prevent nullrefs when we have no 'charset='.

2005-08-28 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* StaticFileHandler.cs: use TransmitFile instead of WriteFile. This way
	xsp will use sendfile().

2005-08-28  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* SiteMapNode.cs: fix IHierarchyData.GetParent.

2005-08-26 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs:
	* IntPtrStream.cs: now we only have a read-only MemoryStream or an
	IntPtrStream. The copy is moved into HttpRequest.

2005-08-26  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* WebCategoryAttribute.cs: New. Required internal attribute.
	* WebSysDescriptionAttribute.cs: New. Required internal attribute.

2005-08-26  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* HttpResponseStream.cs: Use GetBuffer so the memory isn't
	duplicated.

2005-08-26 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: GetHandler might return null when, for example,
	a web service fails, but that does not mean that returning a null
	handler should throw another exception, as the web service code
	serialized the error as a faultString. So if the handler is null, just
	don't call ProcessRequest and keep going.

2005-08-26  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: Send the cached headers if this is a cached
	response. Save the headers, date header, and page data. Fix a typo.
	* HttpResponseStream.cs: Add new accesor to get a byte [] of the
	page data.

2005-08-26 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWorkerRequest.cs: SetEndOfSendNotification is a noop. No matter
	what callback you use that never gets called. In XSP I actually
	implement something for this method.
	* HttpServerUtility.cs: unused variable.

2005-08-26 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpInputStream.cs: new ctor that takes a byte [].
	* IntPtrStream.cs: make it work on a byte [] too.

	* HttpRequest.cs:
	(ContentLength): return 0 for negative numbers or error parsing, but
	keep content_length negative in those cases.
	(MakeInputStream): when there's no content-length (or it's negative),
	we still read the request into a MemoryStream. Use
	IsEntireEntityIsPreloaded() as a fast path.

2005-08-25  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* HttpClientCertificate.cs: On 1.x the .ctor throws a 
	ArgumentNullException (but 2.0 throws a NRE).

2005-08-25 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: HttpMethod deserves its own field. Fix IsLocal.

2005-08-25  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs (IsReusable): return true.
	(InitOnce): remove the initialization of handler_factory from
	here.
	(GetHandler) and move it here, so we make sure to load handlers
	from all needed web.config files.

2005-08-25 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpServerUtility.cs: use GetHandler().
	* HttpApplication.cs: remove obsolete method. Now Transfe/Execute work.

2005-08-25 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: no need for the local var. here.

2005-08-25  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs (InitOnce): move the initialization of
	modules above the call to HttpApplicationFactory.AttachEvents,
	since that method accesses HttpApplication.Modules.  Fixes
	nGallery.
	(IsReusable): mark TODO.

2005-08-23 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpResponseHeader.cs: removed obsolete class.
	* HttpResponse.cs: no more 'obsolete' warnings.

2005-08-23 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpRuntime.cs: implemeted some missing properties.

2005-08-22 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: implemented RemoveOutputCacheItem().

2005-08-22 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: implemented GetVaryByCustomString().

2005-08-22 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: implemented SetHeader (allows adding a header
	circumventing the read-only protection of the collection) and SetForm,
	which just assigns a value of the 'form' collection.
	* HttpServerUtility.cs: NameValueCollection -> WebROCollection.

2005-08-22 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpContext.cs:
	* HttpRequest.cs: implemented RewritePath and supporting methods.

2005-08-22  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: Avoid NRE if work_request if null in the ctor.
	* HttpResponse.cs: Avoid NRE if work_request if null in the ctor.

2005-08-20 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: if there's any exception thrown when getting the
	handler, don't add an extra error to the context, as we already have
	one.

2005-08-20 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpWriter.cs:
	* HttpResponse.cs:
	* HttpWorkerRequest.cs:
	* HttpApplication.cs: added mising attributes and enabled methods
	present in 1.1 SP1.

2005-08-20 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* WebROCollection.cs: a collection that allows setting IsReadOnly.
	* HttpRequest.cs: implemented MapImageCoordinates(). Use WebROCollection
	instead of a NameValueCollection in Form, Headers, Params, QueryString.

2005-08-19 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpInputStream.cs: new copy ctor.
	* IntPtrStream.cs: getters for base_address and size.
	* HttpRequest.cs: implemented SaveAs(). Use a wrapper on top of
	InputStream so that reading POST form or files does not modify the state
	if InputStream. Don't use uri_builder.Query in QueryStringRaw, as it
	returns the '?'.

2005-08-18 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: implemented UserLanguages and reuse code from
	AcceptTypes.

2005-08-18 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: implemented AcceptTypes.

2005-08-18 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: implemented this[] in terms of Params. Don't add the
	header collection in Params.

2005-08-18 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: fix Files property.
	* HttpApplication.cs: invoke the default authentication event after all 
	the other auth. modules.

2005-08-18 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* ServerVariablesCollection.cs: mark the collection as read-only except
	when we fill it. Add the HTTP_blah key/value pairs too.

2005-08-18  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs (get_Params): implement.

2005-08-17  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: HttpResponse's Cookie's collection acts
	differently than HttpRequests in that it never returns null from
	the "this [string]" accessor.

2005-08-17 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: check length 0 case when reading a POST.

2005-08-17 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpContext.cs: added security attributes for User and
	SkipAuthorization properties.
	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: AttachEvents is now called form the
	application .ctor. Recycle instead of dispose.
	* HttpApplication.cs: attach events to the newly created application.

2005-08-15  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ApplicationShutdownReason.cs: make build

2005-08-15  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: Update comments

	* HttpPostedFile.cs: Use a substream to read from the uploaded
	multiparts. 

	* HttpRequest.cs: use new code to read the uploaded files.

2005-08-12  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	2.x API fixage and small additions:
	
	* HttpResponse.cs: Make constructor internal.

	* HttpRequest.cs (IsLocal): Expose if NET_2.x

	* HttpContext.cs: Remove internal routine.

	* HttpApplication.cs: Add 2.x events. 

	* HttpRequest.cs: Another iFolder issue: I was not setting up the
	uri_builder here.

	Fixes to get iFolder to work:
	
	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: Set the context when we are initting
	the application.

	* HttpApplication.cs (SetContext): helper routine. 

	* HttpResponse.cs: Implement the various cache operations:n
	Expires, ExpiresAbsolute, CacheControl.

	Actually produce the Cache-Control header, the "Cache" property
	takes precedence over the compatibility settings (Expires,
	ExpiresAbsolutely and CacheControl). 

	* HttpCachePolicy.cs: Fix style.

	Fix the generation of the headers, use lower-case values, do not
	add the max-value if the value is zero.  

	Allow for all possible values in SetCacheability. 

	* HttpRuntime.cs (ClrInstallDirectory): Implement.

	* HttpResponseStream.cs: Remove debugging stuff. 

2005-08-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	Big chunked handling rewrite, and integration of Ben's unmanaged
	output stream.

	* HttpWriter.cs: Delegate chunked encoding writing to the
	HttpResponse. 

	* HttpResponse.cs: Rework the chunked encoding system, centralize
	it all. 

	* HttpResponseStream.cs: Deploy Ben's bucket-base unmanaged
	buffers code. 

	Changed the way that we handle chunked encoding, centralize it
	all;  

	Remove a lot of manual handling of buffering turned off, and
	instead delegate it all to Flush, fixes several issues with the
	new framework.

	* HttpWorkerRequest.cs (SendResponseFromMemory (IntPtr, int)):
	Provide a default implementation since currently XSP does not have
	this method implemented. 

2005-08-11  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 
 
	* HttpClientCertificate.cs: Culture insensitive int parsing. Fixed
	NET_2_0 build.

2005-08-10  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* ServerVariablesCollection.cs: For Ben.  Implement the header
	fetching here, do not implement it in HttpRequest.cs.

2005-08-10  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 
 
	* HttpClientCertificate.cs: Changed IsPresent logic so that new unit
	tests will work as expected.

2005-08-10  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* HttpClientCertificate.cs: Implemented, except for validation. Note 
	that the HttpWorkerRequest derived classes must be updated to supply 
	the required informations.
	* HttpRequest.cs: Create an HttpClientCertificate on first call to
	ClientCertificate.

2005-08-09  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* HttpRuntime.cs (AspInstallDirectory): Implement.

2005-08-09  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* HttpClientCertificate.cs: New. Stub. It won't be fun to test.

2005-08-04  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@ximian.com>

	* HttpContext.cs: Kill a NIE.

2005-08-04  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: Change "Start" event like the "End"
	event, and only do this once, when we init the type.

	Fire the "Application_Start" event after we create the type.

2005-08-03 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: catch a ThreadAbort (coming from Response.End)
	here too.

2005-08-03 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: setting the Status property resets the
	StatusDescription (see the tests) and the default value for the
	description is the one provided by GetStatusDescription() in
	HttpWorkerRequest.

2005-08-03 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: s/boundry/boundary/ and fix typo in array creation.

2005-08-03 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: add call to EndOfRequest when everything is said
	and done.

2005-08-02  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: Stub for TransmitFile.

	* HttpRequest.cs (IsAuthenticated): Implement.

2005-08-01  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: Cope with implementations of HttpWorkerRequest
	(unpatched xsp) that do not send back the PreloadedEntityBody. 

	* HttpApplication.cs: keep track of the factory. 
	(Dispose): Only dispose once, clean up other variables, release
	the ManualResetEvent.
	Release the handler to the factory.

	* HttpApplicationFactory.cs: Implement a stack to reuse the
	applications. 

	* HttpRequest.cs: On uploads, if the ContentLenght is zero, throw
	a 411.

	* HttpRuntime.cs: Recycle the application after using it.

	* HttpPostedFile.cs: Implement SaveAs.

	* HttpContext.cs: Return the "Server" property.

2005-08-01 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpServerUtility.cs: implemented missing bits.

2005-08-01 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: query string was getting a '?' as the start of the
	first variable name. This makes the asmx help page work again.

2005-08-01  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs (Cookies, Forms): Add validation.
	(Forms): Add application/x-www-form-urlencoded parsing and
	multipart/form-data parsing.
	
	(HttpMultiPart): Implement new class to load multi-part data from
	a stream since there is no longer a byte [] that holds the data
	(currently we have an unmanaged IntPtr buffer wrapped as a
	stream).  Also the 2.x framework will add support for large
	uploads which are sent directly to disk, which will require the
	FileStream interface. 
	
	(Path, PathInfo): Fill a couple more methods to avoid crashes.

	* HttpContext.cs: Fill another one to get web services summary
	page painting.  The page does not work though.
	
	* HttpApplication.cs: Rework the pipeline to not depend on
	`finally', as `finally' would not be invoked if we choose not to
	call the pipeline again (which happens if the `stop' variable is
	set). 

	Instead force the pipeline to go to the shutdown, and yield from
	there after all the release-state callbacks have been invoked. 

2005-07-31  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* HttpApplication.cs: Remove debugging messages since the compiler
	bug has been fixed.

	You must use at least mcs from revision 47879 for the application
	pipeline to work. 

2005-07-30  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* HttpContext.cs: Error handling methods.

	* HttpResponse.cs: Trigger the last event.

	* HttpRuntime.cs: Add queueing of the next request. 

	* HttpApplication.cs: Deploy the new yield-based application
	pipeline, add error handling to the pipeline.
	
	* HttpApplication.cs (AsyncRequestState): Just use the done event
	from the parent.

2005-07-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* HttpResponseStream.cs, HttpRequest.cs: Fix bugs found by nunit.

	* HttpApplication.cs: Fix a race condition. 

	* HttpResponseStream.cs: Fix bug, send the size of the buffer that
	we have so far instead of the internal size of the buffer.   This
	will need work later to ensure we enforce the Content-Length
	maximum output size if set.

	* ServerVariablesCollection.cs: This class now inherits from
	NameValueCollection, we should probably review what the middle
	class did, there are no dependencies on it.

	I need to write tests to investigate if something is missing or
	has changed in this implementation. 

2005-07-27  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* HttpRequest.cs: No happy replies here, send a 411.

2005-07-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* HttpResponseHeader.cs: remove spew.
	
2005-07-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* HttpResponseHeader.cs (HttpResponseHandler..ctor): use
	HttpWorkerRequest.GetKnownResponseHeaderName instead of
	GetKnownRequestHeaderName.  Fixes Response.Redirect until miguel's
	new HttpReponse is online.

2005-07-26  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* HttpResponse.cs: use_chunked is now a byte-array, if not null,
	we use it to hold the size of the chunked so we do not have to
	allocate many of these. 
	(SendSize): Helper routine to send the chunked headers.
	(BinaryWrite): First user of the chunked writer.

	* HttpApplication.cs: Do not crash if they request a Server
	instance, but throw a NotImplementedException.

	* HttpRequest.cs: fix a few problems exposed by the regression
	test suite.

	* HttpRequest.cs (Cookies): use Chris' new constructor to get the
	cookies parsed.

	: The big Uri rework: instead of using QueryString
	as the population mechanism, populate an UriBuilder from the
	various HttpWorkerRequest methods.

	* HttpWorkerRequest.cs (GetProtocol): Implement in terms of
	IsSecure().

	* HttpResponse.cs: Pointed by Ben, Write (null) is a nop instead
	of a crash.

	* HttpContext.cs: Add a couple of properties to help the 2.x
	build.
	
	* HttpResponse.cs: Make ContentLength a long, add back support for
	session's app_path_mod.

2005-07-20  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* HttpCookieCollection.cs: use "auto-fill mode" when we're dealing

	redo this later.

	* MultiPartContentParser.cs: use a MemoryStream as HttpInputStream
	will now be using IntPtrStream.

	instead of trying to be smart about it ourselves.

	but it might be due to a bug in NameValueCollection.
