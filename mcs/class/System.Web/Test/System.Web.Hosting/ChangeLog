	* SimpleWorkerRequestTest.cs (Host): make cwd =
	"Environment.CurrentDirectory + Path.DirectorySeparatorChar" so we
	pass on MS.

	* SimpleWorkerRequestTest.cs: add 2 more assertions.
	* ApplicationHostTest.cs: fix test for the path of web.config.

	* SimpleWorkerRequestTest.cs: Do not use the "/tmp" directory as
	that makes the tests fail if we create a hosted
	SimpleWorkerRequest.

	Instead use the current directory, and before starting up, create
	a bin directory and copy the assembly there to allow us to create
	a host.

	Also, replicate the tests for when we are hosted in a new
	appdomain, as "MapPath" does work in this case.  When running
	SimpleWorkerRequest on the main domain MapPath always returns
	null.
