	* BuildProvider.cs: made the Extension property case-insensitive

2010-04-09  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: GetSection properly processes paths
	of form '~'. Fixes bug #595140. Patch from Adriaan van Kekem
	<avkekem@hotmail.com>, thanks!

2010-04-08 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* GlobalizationSection.cs: use WebName instead of EncodingName.

2010-03-06  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: do not use Request.Path - it may
	fail because of invalid web.config file, use
	Request.PathNoValidation instead.

	* VersionConverter.cs: added

	* PropertyHelper.cs: added a Version converter helper.

	* HttpRuntimeSection.cs: added 4.0 properties -
	RequestPathInvalidCharacters, RequestValidationType and
	RequestValidationMode.

2010-02-23  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* SessionStateSection.cs: implemented 4.0 properties -
	CompressionEnabled and SqlConnectionRetryInterval 

2010-02-12  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationHost.cs: implemented {Encrypt,Decrypt}Section

2010-01-20  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* OutputCacheSection.cs: implemented the Providers and
	DefaultProviderName 4.0 properties.

2010-01-09  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: GetSection properly handles looking
	up and caching of <location> instances. Part of fix for bug
	#568441

	* WebConfigurationHost.cs: GetConfigPathFromLocationSubPath
	calculatesthe path relative to the current config file path. Part
	of fix for bug #568441

2009-12-02  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* CompilationSection.cs: added two properties -
	OptimizeCompilations (3.5+) and TargetFramework (4.0+)

2009-11-19  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationHost.cs: IsDefinitionAllowed now normalizes the
	passed configuration path, so that MachineToApplication sections

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: use an rw lock to protect access to
	sectionCache. This is now necessary as the save handler clears the
	cache.

2009-11-10  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: path passed to OpenWebConfiguration
	from GetSection does not come from FindWebConfig.

2009-11-09  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: there's no need to cache sections by
	_file_ path - using section name and web.config path is more than
	enough and it reduces the number of cache entries
	considerably. Fixes bug #550730

2009-10-07  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: GetSection doesn't perform string +
	char + string concatenation to generate section cache key (by
	Gonzalo Paniagua Javier) which gives an enormous performance boost
	(processing time for mojoportal's default.aspx went down from
	2.65s to 107ms on average). The key generation is performed
	without any kind of string operation right now (except for
	GetHashCode on 3 strings).
	GetSectionCacheKey is called only once and sectionCache became a
	dictionary.

2009-08-20  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: GetSection does not use
	FindWebConfig to get the virtual path to open configuration for -
	doing so would make the configuration system ignore <location>
	sections. Fixes bug #482181

2009-07-23 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: avoid possible infinite loop when the
	path starts with ~ and 1 file check.

2009-07-15  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: another approach to suppressing
	application reloads after the app writes to its root web.config
	file. Leaving the previous code in place to get more
	protection. It's a kludge, but it's the best option to avoid
	all the races caused by System.Configuration+FileSystemWatcher
	without rewriting large parts of System.Configuration (and
	System.Web.Configuration). Fixes bug #522017

2009-07-14  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: added support for suppressing
	application reload when the main config file is written to from
	application.

	* WebConfigurationHost.cs: added minimal implementation of
	WriteCompleted, which checks if there's need to suppress
	application reload.

2009-07-13  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* ProvidersHelper.cs: InstantiateProvider doesn't have to
	explicitly look for types in App_Code assemblies - this is done in
	HttpApplication.LoadType.

2009-07-09 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationHost.cs: null means MachineToApplication.
	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: when caching configuration and sections,
	use the configuration file directory instead of the incoming request
	path.

2009-06-08 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* HttpHandlerAction.cs: fix path matching when the pattern has more
	than one slash.

2009-06-05  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: OpenWebConfiguration caches
	configurations with a key generated from all the parameters passed
	to it, not just from path.
	Added internal GetSection method which takes HttpContext as its
	third parameter - used in calling OpenWebConfiguration.
	FindWebConfig is no longer used in GetSection - it breaks handling
	of <location> elements in config files. Fixes bug #510302

2009-06-03  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* MonoSettingsSection.cs: added new property,
	verificationCompatibility, which serves the same purpose as the
	registry key described in http://support.microsoft.com/kb/932552
	(when set to 1 it turns off virtual path validity
	verification). Fixes bug #509163

2009-05-14  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpHandlersSection.cs: if we're matching a default handler,
	disallow caching.

2009-04-03  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: added code in the static constructor
	to enable retrieving application settings via
	ApplicationSettingsBase from within asp.net applications. Fixes
	bug #491531

	* ApplicationSettingsConfigurationFileMap.cs: added.

2009-03-12  Dean Brettle  <dean@brettle.com>

	* nBrowser/Build.cs: made Browser() method thread-safe and moved the
	actual tree creation to a private InitializeTree() method for clarity.

2009-03-01  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: optimized GetWebApplicationSection a
	bit

2009-02-28  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: make sure no nrex happens in
	GetSectionCacheKey ()

2009-02-26 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: generate a hash from the string hsah
	codes instead of concatenating them.

2009-01-27  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpHandlerAction.cs: removed the matches cache, it doesn't
	improve matters here in 99% of the cases.
	Regexps are no longer used to match handler paths, SearchPattern
	is used instead.

2009-01-26  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationHost.cs: when an attempt to map a fake virtual
	path is made, MapPath returns the aplication physical root
	directory. Fixes bug #463950

2008-01-09  Dean Brettle  <dean@brettle.com>

	* nBrowser/Node.cs: Fixed compatibility bug where <identification> sections were required
	in browser defs.  

2009-01-09  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: do not normalize the path in
	FindWebConfig when getting the virtual directory.

2009-01-08  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: improve performance of
	FindWebConfig.

2009-01-07  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpModulesSection.cs: allow for modules with non-public
	constructors. Fises bug #463971

	* HttpHandlerAction.cs: allow for handlers with non-public
	constructors. Fixes bug #463971

2008-12-24  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: A better version of the previous
	GetSection fix. Right now the method searches for directories
	containing web.config and uses them, if found, to open the web
	configuration. If no web.config is found, web configuration is
	opened for the root application directory.

	* WebConfigurationHost.cs: made GetWebConfigFileName internal
	static, so that code can be reused from WebConfigurationManager.

2008-12-23  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: GetSection should call
	OpenWebConfiguration using the actual directory path, not a file
	path. If it fails to do so, System.Configuration may treat the
	top-level Web.config file as a child one which, in turn, in
	certain circumstances will lead to duplicate keys inserted in
	collections.

2008-12-16  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationHost.cs: IsDefinitionAllowed should treat
	configPath == "~" as the root application path.

2008-12-12  Owen Brady <Ocean@owenbrady.net>

	* nBrowser/File.cs, nBrowser/Identification.cs, nBrowser/Node.cs, nBrowser/NodeTypes.cs,
	nBrowser/Result.cs, nBrowser/Build.cs, nBrowser/Exception.cs, CapabilitiesBuild.cs, 
	CapabilitiesResult.cs: Updated Copyright information to include updated contact information.
	
	* nBrowser/Build.cs: Removed LoadDefaultEmbeddedResource function, the embeded resource
	it is referring too was never included in Mono. And was designed for a free standing 
	browser identification libary.

	* nBrowser/Exception.cs: Removed Compile Attributes and related comments which were left
	in from the original free standing browser libary.
	
	* CapabilitiesBuild.cs: Removed Header Checksum related coding since it is not required
	for the Mono implementation.

	* CapabilitiesResult.cs: Updated Copyright information to include updated contact information. 
	Removed functions which were designed to make use of features of a embeded browser file which
	is not present in Mono.
	
	* CapabilitiesChecksum.cs, RandomRoboBotKeywords.txt: Deleted
2008-10-21  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	settings.

2008-10-01  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* CapabilitiesResult.cs: added support for the "browsers"
	capability - a collection of matching browser ids.

	* nBrowser/Node.cs: store matching browser ids in the capabilities
	collection (to support IsBrowser correctly)

2008-07-25  Dean Brettle <dean@brettle.com>

	* nBrowser/Node.cs nBrowser/Build.cs nBrowser/Identification.cs: Fixed race
	condition in Node.Process() by removing mutating functions from Identification
	and	changing Node.Process() and Node.BrowserIdentification() to maintain
	state in a List<Match> instead of a List<Identification>.
	
	* nBrowser/Node.cs: Fixed race condition associated with lookup of adapter
	types.
	
	* nBrowser/Node.cs: Removed duplicate call to Node.BrowserIdentification() from
	Node.Process().

	* nBrowser/Node.cs: Removed duplicate call to Result.AddAdaper() from Node.Process().
	
	* nBrowser/Node.cs: Fixed bug where capabilities containing literal $ or % were
	dropped.

	* nBrowser/Node.cs: Fixed bug where capabilities with multiple $ substitutions only
	had one applied.

2008-06-30  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@gmail.com>

	* CapabilitiesResult.cs: Make the RandomRoboBotKeywords array static and compute it
	only once.

2008-06-30  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* CompilationSection.cs: hush the warnings

2008-06-26  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@gmail.com>

	* nBrowser/Node.cs nBrowser/Result.cs: Avoid looking up adapter types names for
	every request in every assembly.

2008-05-22  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationHost.cs: changed CreateDeprecatedConfigContext
	to return a new HttpContext object. This is part of a fix for bug 
	#325128. Patch contributed by James Fitzsimons <james.fitzsimons@gmail.com>,
	thanks!

2008-05-07  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* RoleManagerSection.cs: use type converter when creating the
	cookieTimeout property in the static constructor. Fixes bug
	#387526. Patch fromIvan Hamilton <ivan@chimerical.com.au>, thanks! 

2008-03-23  Dean Brettle <dean@brettle.com>

	* CapabilitiesBuild.cs (Process), ICapabilitiesProcess.cs (Process),
	nBrowser/Build.cs (Process): Added initialCapabilities argument to 
	facilitate using browscap.ini capabilities.
	
	* CapabilitiesResult.cs (ctor), nBrowserResult.cs (ctor): Change 
	items arg to IDictionary to	facilitate using browscap.ini capabilities.
	
	* nBrowser/Node.cs (Reset): Removed code which checked prohibited 
	non-alphanumerics in id attributes because .NET is not that strict.
	
	* nBrowser/Node.cs (MergeFrom): Fixed NullReferenceExceptions that
	occurred when the source or destination node did not have any
	capabilities or adapters.
	
	* nBrowser/Result.cs (AddAdapter): Fixed to allow types in other
	assemblies.

2008-03-09  Dean Brettle <dean@brettle.com> 

	* nBrowser/Result.cs, nBrowser/NodeTypes.cs, nBrowser/Identification.cs,
	nBrowser/File.cs, nBrowser/Build.cs, nBrowser/Node.cs, 
	nBrowser/Exception.cs: added.  The code under nBrowser handles *.browser
	files.  It is based on Owen "Ocean" Brady's code, with the following 
	changes and improvements.  Replaced Result.Adapter 
	property with AdapterTypeMap property which maps control Type to adapter
	Type.  Added Result.MarkupTextWriter property.  Added overrides for
	Result.GetAdapters and Result.GetTagWriter to return MarkupTextWriter
	and AdapterTypeMap, resp.  Changed tree building algorithm to not
	depend on nodes with id="Default" and to inject defaultBrowser nodes
	as parents of regular nodes with the same ids.  Changed Node.cs to use
	Item instead of Add when adding a capability or sample header, so that
	values get replaced instead of appended.  Added support for reference 
	nodes (ie. nodes with refID="someID").
		
	* CapabilitiesResult.cs: load RandomRoboBotKeywords.txt resource
	using the correct name.
	
	* RandomRoboBotKeywords.txt: added 

	* HttpCapabilitiesBase.cs (CreateHtmlWriter, Adapters): Added
	support for *.browsers.  Adapters property calls internal virtual
	GetAdapters() method which is overrided in nBrowser.Result 
	returned by nBrowser code.  CreateHtmlWriter uses type specified
	by TagWriter property.
	
2008-03-03  Vladimir Krasnov  <vladimirk@mainsoft.com>

	* ProvidersHelper.cs: fixed thread safety issue in InstantiateProvider

2008-03-01  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	GetSection method

2008-02-07  Vladimir Krasnov  <vladimirk@mainsoft.com>

	* GlobalizationSection.cs: fixed GetSanitizedCulture, performance
	optimization

2008-02-05  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* CompilerCollection.cs: Get (string language) should not use
	BaseGet as our collection is keyed on a list of language names
	(e.g. "cs;csharp") and passing a single language won't match in
	BaseGet correctly. Use the overriden indexer instead.
	Initialize the base class with the case-insensitive
	comparer. Fixes bug #357824.

2008-01-27  Daniel Nauck <dna@mono-project.de>

	* HttpHandlerAction.cs: fixed the internal method PathMatches ()
	removed wrong caching of FileMatchingInfo classes with request specific
	informations. Now we check against the current request path and cache
	the result in a dictionary.
	Also check correctly against all possible paths from the HttpHandler.
		

2007-12-27  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* ProfileGroupSettingsCollection.cs: added an internal method to

	* ProfileSection.cs: defaultProviderProp typo - the name of the
	provider should be "AspNetSqlProfileProvider"

	* RootProfilePropertySettingsCollection.cs: added
	OnDeseerializeUnrecognizedElement to support the profile 'group'
	element.
	Added a missing Unmerge method.

2007-12-11  Vladimir Krasnov  <vladimirk@mainsoft.com>

	* SiteMapSection.cs: fixed ProvidersInternal property to be thread safe

2007-12-08  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: GetSection now runs each section
	through a mapper (if any is defined for the section) before
	returning it to the caller.

2007-11-23  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* TagPrefixCollection.cs: changed the collection type to
	BasicMap.

	* RoleManagerSection.cs: CookieTimeout property custom attributes
	changed to match MS.NET's ones.

	* AuthorizationRuleCollection.cs: removed the ThrowOnDuplicate
	property - it's not found in the MS.NET version of the class.

	The old properties from MachineKeySection.cs became methods.

2007-10-24  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* HttpHandlerAction.cs: exact path matching must be done on the
	original string in PathMatches, not on the sliced one. Fixes bug
	#335669.

2007-10-17  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationHost.cs: if running outside hosted environment,
	read only the assemblyname.config configuration file instead of
	web.config. Fixes bug #332425

2007-10-15  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* ProvidersHelper.cs: use HttpApplication.LoadType instead of

2007-06-03  Adar Wesley <adarw@mainsoft.com>

	* ProfilePropertySettingsCollection.cs: added missing method 
	OnDeserializeUnrecognizedElement.

2007-05-30  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: if errors happen when opening the
	configuration file, mark the manager as unsafe to prevent further
	usage and avoid error loops.

2007-05-17  Igor Zelmanovich <igorz@mainsoft.com>

	* WebConfigurationHost.cs: for TARGET_J2EE only:
	prevent NullRefference Exception.

2007-05-15  Igor Zelmanovich <igorz@mainsoft.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: 
	make configurations hashtable case-insensitive.

	on case-sensitive file system.

2007-05-15  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* BuildProviderCollection.cs: refactoring - use
	HttpApplication.LoadType to actually look up the type.

	* HttpHandlerAction.cs: as above

	* WebConfigurationHost.cs: refactoring - moved the LoadType to
	HttpApplication to share the code between 1.1 and 2.0 profiles.

	exception is caught, throw a HttpException for Bad Request (400).
	Look for types in the top-level assemblies (App_Code and
	friends).

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: added two internal methods for safe
	retrieval of config sections.

2007-04-19  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* NullableStringValidator.cs : new internal class that is almost
	  identical to StringValidator but allows null value.
	* PropertyHelper.cs : use new NullableStringValidator.
	* NamespaceCollection.cs : in NamespaceInfo "" is not allowed.

2006-06-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* WebConfigurationHost.cs (InitForConfiguration): i know this is
	going to bite me in the ass, but guard against configPath being ==
	to "/", since this will result in an infinite loop.
	(MapPath): fix a NRE.

2006-05-18  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: recent sys.config.dll changes on
	  ConfigurationManager.GetSection() which should call
	  GetRuntimeObject() should also apply here. Fixed monodoc web.

2006-05-10  Andrew Skiba <andrews@mainsoft.com>

	* HttpHandlerAction.cs: keep the internal exception

2006-05-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs (GetBasePath): fix bug where
	path.Length was 0 when we got to the last while loop (and indexed
	-1 into an array.)  Thanks Marek for the fix.

2006-05-04  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	[ Fixes bug #78256 ]
	
	* WebConfigurationHost.cs (GetConfigType): add a MonoTODO about
	how we should use the build provider machinery to get types.
	(MapPath): add rudimentary mapping in the case where we don't have
	a request, basically handle the case where the url begins with (or
	is) HttpRuntime.AppDomainAppVirtualPath.

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs (GetSection): if we don't have a
	valid request, open the web configuration corresponding to
	HttpRuntime.AppDomainAppVirtualPath.
	(GetBasePath): comment this a little, and make it work in the case
	where we don't have an HttpRequest.

2006-04-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* AuthorizationRuleCollection.cs (ThrowOnDuplicate): for the time
	being introduce a overridden property MS doesn't make use of.
	This needs readdressing, but it should get people making use of
	<authorization> rules working again.

2006-04-25  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* AuthorizationRule.cs (Reset): finally figure out what this
	method is supposed to do.  Assign our Action property based on
	parentElement's.

2006-04-25  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* WebConfigurationHost.cs (InitForConfiguration): actually, use
	HttpRuntime.AppDomainAppVirtualPath on gonzalo's recommendation.
	It's never null, and its use cleans things up a bit.

2006-04-25  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* WebConfigurationHost.cs (InitForConfiguration): stop going up
	the virtual hierarchy once we reach the application's base virtual
	path.

2006-04-24  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* AuthorizationSection.cs (IsValidUser): fix a problem that
	surfaced when converting from the 1.1 to 2.0 config classes.  Only
	check for verb match if there are actually verbs to match against.

2006-04-11  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ExpressionBuilderCollection.cs (CreateNewElement): call argless
	ctor.

	* ExpressionBuilder.cs: add internal argumentless ctor for use by
	the collection type.

2006-03-24  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs (GetConfig): add a fallback case for
	configuration sections that don't subclass from
	ConfigurationSection.

2006-03-24  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* WebConfigurationHost.cs: fix bug where OpenWebConfiguration
	("/") would result in 2 configurations for that toplevel path to
	be opened.

2006-03-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ProvidersHelper.cs: implement this static class properly.

	* SiteMapSection.cs (ProvidersInternal): add internal property to
	get the actual SiteMapProviderCollection from here.

2006-02-28  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* BuildProviderAppliesTo.cs, PagesToCountAction.cs: nuke.

2006-02-10 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* Compiler.cs:
	* CompilerCollection.cs: removed compatibility code.

	* BuildProviderCollection.cs: add GetProviderForExtension().

2006-02-02  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs (GetSection(string,string)):
	implement.

2006-02-01  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* TrustLevelCollection.cs, CodeSubDirectoriesCollection.cs,
	  CustomErrorCollection.cs, CompilerCollection.cs,
	  HttpHandlerActionCollection.cs,
	  FormsAuthenticationUserCollection.cs,
	  AuthorizationRuleCollection.cs, TagPrefixCollection.cs :
	  CollectionType is public.

2006-02-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: In the normal case, get the current
	request's web.config, not the application's.  If there is no
	current request, get the application's.
	(GetWebApplicationConfiguration): use Request.ApplicationPath, not
	Request.PhysicalApplicationPath.  OpenWebConfiguration takes
	virtual paths.

	* HttpConfigurationSystem.cs: GetWebApplicationSection =>
	GetSection.

2006-02-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* CompilerCollection.cs: CONFIGURATION_2_0 => NET_2_0

	* Compiler.cs: same.

2006-02-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* HttpConfigurationSystem.cs: SupportsUserConfig == true.  let's
	use this to determine if ConfigurationManager.AppSettings should
	be read-only or not.

2006-01-31  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: err, why did i ifdef stuff NET_2_0
	inside of an ifdef NET_2_0?

2006-01-30  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: lots of little changes.  hopefully
	this doesn't break anyone.  it fixes all the nunit problems
	gonzalo was having.

	* WebConfigurationHost.cs (GetStreamName): in the MachineWebPath
	case, handle the case where we have a WebConfigurationFileMap.
	(MapPath): this is likely wrong, but in the case where we don't
	have a file map or current HttpContext, just return the path.

2006-01-29  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* HttpModulesSection.cs (LoadModules): I'm not sure we want to
	solve this problem in this way, but the 1.x code forces
	DefaultAuthenticationModule to be in the list of modules..
	Without this fix (or something else) HttpContext.User is null when
	it shouldn't be.

2006-01-26  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* HttpConfigurationSystem.cs: new class that gets sections from
	web.config files.

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs: change a lot of the
	NotImplementedExceptions to NotSupportedExceptions.
	(AppSettings): implement by just returning
	ConfigurationManager.AppSettings (note this is broken because
	ConfigurationManager.AppSettings are read-only, but it works for
	reading.)
	(ConnectionStrings): same (and probably broken in the same way..)
	(Init): replace the 2.0 IInternalConfigSystem with our
	HttpConfigurationSystem.

	* WebConfigurationHost.cs: add a comment about how things are
	likely to work in the face of IRemoteWebConfigurationHostServer.
	(CreateConfigurationContext): return a WebContext instance.

2006-01-25  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* AuthorizationSection.cs (IsValidUser): instead of a blanket
	false for a null user, just set the username to "" and short
	circuit out the check for roles.

2006-01-25  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* AuthorizationRule.cs (CheckUser): handle * and ?, and use
	String.Compare instead of ==.
	(CheckVerb): use String.Compare instead of ==.

	* AuthorizationSection.cs (IsValidUser): return false for a null
	user.

2006-01-22  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* GlobalizationSection.cs (VerifyData): quiet mcs.

2006-01-18  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	(GetSection): try to load the section
	using GetWebApplicationSection before calling into
	ConfigurationManager.GetSection.
	(GetWebApplicationConfiguration): move common code to here.
	(GetWebApplicationSection): use GetWebApplicationConfiguration.
	(AppSettings): implement.

	* WebConfigurationHost.cs (GetWebConfigFileName): add
	"Web.Config", and move to an array/loop implementation.  maybe we
	should scan the directory and check ToLower() instead of
	explicitly enumerating?

2006-01-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* SystemWebSectionGroup.cs (HostingEnvironment): enable this property.
	(ProcessModel): add the ConfigurationPropertyAttribute.

2006-01-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* PagesSection.cs (.cctor): fix the default value for the
	enableSessionState attribute - it's not a bool, but a
	PagesEnableSessionState enum.

2006-01-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* MachineKeySection.cs (ValidationKeyBytes, DecryptionKeyBytes,
	DecryptionKey192Bits): if the keys are null, generate them.  Fixes
	Page.EnableViewStateMac support.

2006-01-09  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* RoleManagerSection.cs, SqlCacheDepencendySection.cs,
	SessionStateSection.cs, TraceSection.cs, SecurityPolicySection.cs,
	PagesSection.cs, RulesSettings.cs, UrlMappingSection.cs: fix
	dumper output.

2006-01-09  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ExpressionBuilderCollection.cs (.cctor): no need to create a
	collection property here.  we're already in the collection.

	* CompilationSection.cs: fix typo.

2006-01-04  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* MachineKeySection.cs: bring over some more internal methods from
	MachineKeyConfig, and call Set{Decryption,Validation}Key from
	their respective property setters.

2006-01-03  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* AuthorizationSection.cs (IsValidUser): add analogous method from
	AuthorizationConfig.cs.

	* AuthorizationRule.cs: add predicates for Verb, User, and Role
	analogous to what existed in AuthorizationConfig.cs.

2005-12-11  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* WebConfigurationManager.cs (OpenMachineConfiguration): just call
	ConfigurationManager.OpenMachineConfiguration.
	(OpenWebConfiguration): remove the "IntPtr userToken" version and
	add a "string userName" version to clean up corcompare output.
	Modify all the overloads to pass null instead of IntPtr.Zero.
	(GetWebApplicationSection): if we're not running in a web
	application, use the machine configuration.

2005-12-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* CodeSubDirectory.cs (DirectoryName): don't use an private field,
	but base[directoyNameProp].

	* AuthorizationRuleCollection.cs (Add): use BaseAdd (rule, false),
	so we can insert duplicates.
	(GetKey): nuke.
	(GetElementKey): MS for some reason just uses the action for the
	key, ToString()'ed.
	(Remove): pass the correct key.

	* ProfileGroupSettings.cs (GetHashCode): implement.

	* GlobalizationSection.cs (GetEncoding): for the utf-8 case, just
	use Encoding.UTF8.

	* AssemblyCollection.cs (Add): use BaseAdd (info, false) so we can
	insert duplicates.

	* CacheSection.cs (.cctor): make privateByteLimit's default 0L so
	we don't get a invalid cast exception later on.

	* AuthorizationRule.cs (VerifyData): split out the verification
	foo from PreSerialize.
	(PostDeserialize): so we can call it from here.
	(PreSerialize): and here.

2005-12-05  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* AuthorizationRuleCollection.cs (GetKey): split out the logic for

	and UICulture properties.

2005-12-01  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	or if the System.Configuration infrastructure should.. time will
	tell.
	(PreSerialize): throw if Roles.Count and Users.Count == 0.
	(SerializeElement): write out the element here.  don't chain up to

2005-11-30  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* CompilerCollection.cs: ugly hack to fix the
	2.0-without-config-2.0 case.  wrap this file in #if

	* Compiler.cs: same.

2005-11-28  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

2005-11-28  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	use in HttpModuleActionCollection.

2005-11-28  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* GlobalizationSection.cs (..cctor): the encoding
	ConfigurationProperties are of type "string", even though the
	properties themselves are of type Encoding.  we do conversions
	manually in the setter/getters.  gross.  Add code (mostly c&p +
	massaged from GlobalizationConfigurationHandler) for this and also
	to handle the culture gettes.

2005-11-26  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* AuthorizationRuleCollection.cs (GetElementKey): implement this.

	* ProfilePropertyNameValidator.cs: make this internal, and add a
