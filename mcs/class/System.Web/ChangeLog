	* System.Web -- Assembly build.
	  Another milestone reached. Compiled 195 classes successfully.
	  Build includes System.Web.UI.WebControls and all the dependencies
	  for the namespace.

	* System.Web.Security: Added directory.

2002-03-04  Gaurav Vaish <gvaish@iitk.ac.in>

	* System.Web.UI.WebContorls: Virtually complete. See
	  System.Web.UI.WebControls/ChangeLog for a comprehensensive
	  description of what's left and where. But, don't go for
	  a build at this stage. There are a few classes left in
	  System.Web namespace that need to be filled-up, though
	  I will try to fix up the current state to be able to make
	  a build.

       Did first successful build of System.Web.dll that included
	 System.Web.UI.WebControls namespace. Though, not updating
	 the System.Web.build file, since with the changes that
	 followed, the build again fails :(
