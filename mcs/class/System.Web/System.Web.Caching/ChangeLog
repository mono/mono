	* Cache.cs:
	* CacheDefinitions.cs:
	* CacheDependency.cs:
	* CacheEntry.cs:

	* ExpiresBuckets.cs: reformatted, make class status page happier. Does
	not work yet (wait for the next patch).

	* CacheEntry.cs: several changes. New constants, use of constants
	defined in Cache.cs, modified locks to optimize perf. Fixed property
	sets which weren't using the keyword value to set the new values
	(don't know how this worked before!).

	* Cache.cs: changed singleton implementation to only create the object
	when actually used. Changed Insert overloads to use constants
	defined instead of hard values.

	* ExpiresBuchets: major changes. All locking now uses ReaderWriterLock
	class. Bucket now efectively reuses free indexes from removed items
	to avoid unnecessary expansions. Expansion now uses Array.CopyTo to
	add elements to the new list. Added private Int32Collection to
	handle int indexes efficiently (thanks Shawn Van Ness). See comments
	there.
