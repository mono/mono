	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/ObjectWriter.cs: code to build objects at
	runtime from a xaml file. Current problems are with events and
	delegates (current behaviour is untested and possibly useless) and
	DependencyProperties (not implemented yet)

2005-07-08  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlWriter.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs: removed TypeConverter
	  stuff from everything except CodeWriter. By using TypeDescriptor,
	  the generator doesn't need to be told about the converter and since
	  the framework will find it we don't have to search for it.

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlWriter.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs: support for x:Name
	  attributes and for considering Name properties to have the same
	  affect.

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs: cleaned up a little, added
	support for the `partial' class modifier

2005-07-06  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/Mapping.cs: removed in favour of
	System.Windows.Serialization/Mapper.cs
	* System.Windows.Serialization/Mapper.cs: Added because it is the
	microsoft-documented mapping API
	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs: transition to the new
	mapper system, also some general converging on the name
	DependencyProperty throughout instead of ContextProperty or
	AttachedProperty.

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlWriter.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs: add support for attached
	  properties as attributes, supplementing the existing support for
	  attached properties as elements

2005-07-05  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlWriter.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs: add support for delegate
	  properties and for events
	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlWriter.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs,
	  Mono.Windows.Serialization/Mapper.cs: tighten up types so that Type
	  and PropertyInfo are passed instead of strings

2005-07-03  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs: added support for Code
	elements, provide fully qualified name of type to attach to, skip
	xmns: attributes when processing, 
	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlWriter.cs: added WriteCode member,
	ordered methods by type of thing dealt with
	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs: added support for Code
	elements, call empty constructor for objects, call TypeConverter
	almost correctly.

2005-07-03  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs: use CodeDom to do code
	generation
	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/CodeWriter.cs:
	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlWriter.cs:
	* Mono.Windows.Serialization/XamlParser.cs: initial TypeConverter
	support
