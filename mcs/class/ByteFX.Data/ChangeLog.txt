* Fixed command sql processing so quotes are better handled (thanks Theo Spears)

6/9/2003
========MySQL===============
* Fixed parsing of double, single, and decimal values to account for non-English separators.
  You still have to use the right syntax if you using hard coded sql, but if you use parameters
  the code will convert floating point types to use '.' appropriately internal both into the server
  and out.
  [ Thanks anonymous ]
* Added MySqlStream class to simplify timeOuts and driver coding.
* Fixed DataReader so that it is closed properly when the associated connection is closed.  
  [thanks smishra]

  can be used to run another command
* Improved DBNull.Value handling in the fields
* Added several unit tests
* Fixed MySqlException so that the base class is actually called  :-o
* Improved driver coding

* Character sets are handled much more intelligently now.  The driver queries MySQL at startup for the default character set.
  That character set is then used for conversions if that code page can be loaded.  If not, then the default code
  page for the current OS is used.  

3/31/2003
* Added code to save the inferred type in the name,value ctor of Parameter
