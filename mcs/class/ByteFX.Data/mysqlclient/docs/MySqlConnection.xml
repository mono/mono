		A <b>MySqlConnection</b> object represents a session to a MySQL Server 
		data source.  When you create an instance of <B>MySqlConnection</B>, all 
		properties are set to their initial values. For a list of these values, see the 
		<B>MySqlConnection</B> constructor.
	</para>

	<para>
		If the <B>MySqlConnection</B> goes out of scope, it is not closed. Therefore, 
		you must explicitly close the connection by calling <see cref="MySqlConnection.Close"/> 
		or <see cref="MySqlConnection.Dispose"/>.
	</para>

</remarks>

<example>
	The following example creates a <see cref="MySqlCommand"/> and 
	a <B>MySqlConnection</B>. The <B>MySqlConnection</B> is opened and set as the  
	<see cref="MySqlCommand.Connection"/> for the <B>MySqlCommand</B>. The example then calls  
	<see cref="MySqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery"/>, and closes the connection. To accomplish this, the <B>ExecuteNonQuery</B> is 
	passed a connection string and a query string that is a SQL INSERT 
	statement.

		The following example creates a MySqlConnection

Public Sub CreateSqlConnection()

	myConnection.Open()

<MyMembers name="ConnectionString">
	<remarks>
	<para>The <B>ConnectionString</B> returned may not be exactly like what was originally
	set but will be indentical in terms of keyword/value pairs.  Security information
	will not be included unless the Persist Security Info value is set to true. 
	</para>
	<para>You can use the <B>ConnectionString</B> property to connect to a database. 
	The following example illustrates a typical connection string.</para>
	<c>"Persist Security Info=False;database=MyDB;server=MySqlServer;user id=myUser;Password=myPass"</c>
	<para>The <B>ConnectionString</B> property can be set only when the connection is 
	closed. Many of the connection string values have corresponding read-only 
	properties. When the connection string is set, all of these properties are 
	updated, except when an error is detected. In this case, none of the properties 
	are updated. <see cref="MySqlConnection"/> properties return only those settings contained in the 
	<B>ConnectionString</B>.</para>
	<para>To connect to a local machine, specify "localhost" for the server. If you do not 
	specify a server, localhost is assumed.</para>
	<para>Resetting the <B>ConnectionString</B> on a closed connection resets all 
	connection string values (and related properties) including the password. For 
	example, if you set a connection string that includes "Database= MyDb", and 
	then reset the connection string to "Data Source=myserver;User Id=myUser;Password=myPass", 
	the <see cref="MySqlConnection.Database"/> property is no longer set to MyDb.</para>
	<para>The connection string is parsed immediately after being set. If errors in 
	syntax are found when parsing, a runtime exception, such as <see cref="ArgumentException"/>, 
	is generated. Other errors can be found only when an attempt is made to open the 
	connection.</para>
	<para>The basic format of a connection string consists of a series of keyword/value 
	pairs separated by semicolons. The equal sign (=) connects each keyword and its 
	value. To include values that contain a semicolon, single-quote character, or 
	double-quote character, the value must be enclosed in double quotes. If the 
	value contains both a semicolon and a double-quote character, the value can be 
	enclosed in single quotes. The single quote is also useful if the value begins 
	with a double-quote character. Conversely, the double quote can be used if the 
	value begins with a single quote. If the value contains both single-quote and 
	double-quote characters, the quote character used to enclose the value must be 
	doubled each time it occurs within the value.</para>
	<para>To include preceding or trailing spaces in the string value, the value must 
	be enclosed in either single quotes or double quotes. Any leading or trailing 
	spaces around integer, Boolean, or enumerated values are ignored, even if 
	enclosed in quotes. However, spaces within a string literal keyword or value are 
	preserved. Using .NET Framework version 1.1, single or double quotes may be used 
	within a connection string without using delimiters (for example, Data Source= 
	my'Server or Data Source= my"Server), unless a quote character is the first or 
	last character in the value.</para>
	<para>To include an equal sign (=) in a keyword or value, it must be preceded by 
	another equal sign. For example, in the hypothetical connection string</para>
	<c>"key==word=value"</c>
	<para></para>
	<para>the keyword is "key=word" and the value is "value".</para>
	<para>If a specific keyword in a keyword= value pair occurs multiple times in a 
	connection string, the last occurrence listed is used in the value set.</para>
	<para>Keywords are not case sensitive.</para>
	<para>The following table lists the valid names for keyword values within the 
	<B>ConnectionString</B>.</para>

<para><B>Note</B>  The ByteFX Data Provider for MySQL uses the native socket protocol to 
communicate with MySQL.  Therefore, it does not support the use of an ODBC data source name (DSN) when 
connecting to MySQL because it does not add an ODBC layer.</para>
<para><B>CAUTION</B>  In this release, the application should use caution when constructing a 
connection string based on user input (for example when retrieving user ID and password information from a 
dialog box, and appending it to the connection string). The application should 
ensure that a user cannot embed extra connection string parameters in these 
values (for example, entering a password as "validpassword;database=somedb" in 
an attempt to attach to a different database).</para>
