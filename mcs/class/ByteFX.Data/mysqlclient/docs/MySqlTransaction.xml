	The application creates a <B>MySqlTransaction</B> object by calling <see cref="MySqlConnection.BeginTransaction"/>
	on the <see cref="MySqlConnection"/> object. All subsequent operations associated with the 
	transaction (for example, committing or aborting the transaction), are performed on the 
	<B>MySqlTransaction</B> object.
</remarks>

<example>
	The following example creates a <see cref="MySqlConnection"/> and a <B>MySqlTransaction</B>. 
	It also demonstrates how to use the <see cref="MySqlConnection.BeginTransaction"/>, 
	<see cref="MySqlTransaction.Commit"/>, and <see cref="MySqlTransaction.Rollback"/> methods.
