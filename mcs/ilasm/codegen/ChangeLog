	* FieldDef.cs: Set the underlying type for data constants. This
	fixes bug #70153.

2004-08-01  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* DebuggingInfo.cs : csc build fix (see bug #62230).

2004-07-27  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* IInstr.cs (IInstr): Made this an abstract class and not an
	interface, added a .ctor which takes a Location.
	(IInstr.Location): New public readonly field.

	* CodeGen.cs (CodeGen.SymbolWriter): New public property.
	(CodeGen.BeginSourceFile, EndSourceFile): New public methods.
	(CodeGen.EndMethodDef): Take a `Location' argument.
	(CodeGen.Write): Create debugging info if the user requested it.

	* MethodDef.cs (MethodDef.ctor): Added `CodeGen codegen' and
	`Location start' arguments.  If the user requested debugging
	information, register ourselves with the symbol writer.
	(MethodDef.WriteCode): Emit debugging information.

	* DebuggingInfo.cs: New file.

2004-07-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MethodDef.cs: Params are 1 based if the method is instance
	because of the 'this' arg.
	
2004-07-21  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ExternTypeRefInst.cs: Use the PeapiType so that modified types
	will actually work. Add a Clone method so that type ref insts
	aren't duplicated making them modified multiple times.
	
2004-07-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MethodDef.cs: Local lists are not lazyily allocated so they were
	getting added to every method. This is legal but wastes space.

2004-07-08  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* CodeGen.cs: Add assembly custom attributes to the pe file.
	* CustomAttr.cs: Custom attributes are now added through the
	pefile, this ensures that they get emitted properly.
	* ExternTable.cs: Allow adding custom attributes to assembly
	refs.
	
2004-06-26  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* TypeDef.cs: Preserve the order of fields in a class. Then after
	all the fields have been defined reset the order in PEAPI to the
	correct order. This is done so sequential layouts actually
	work. The order needs to be reset because it can be lost during
	the recursive definition phase.
	* MethodDef.cs: Use and ExternModule for pinvoke data's module
	refs. This way we don't get duplicate module refs.
	
2004-06-24  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MethodDef.cs: Report when defining methods just like MS.
	* TypeDef.cs: Error message when we can't find a locla method.
	
2004-06-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MethodDef.cs: sigh, another varargs fix that probably breaks
	other varargs tets. Someday I will get this right, I don't think
	today is that day though. This fix basically just makes sure to
	trim the sentinel off of signatures. Also eliminated some code
	duplication.
	* ParamDef.cs: Make IsSentinel work for both cases of generating a
	sentinel param def.
	
2004-06-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* SwitchInstr.cs: Allow switches with no labels.
	
2004-06-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* InstrTable.cs: Add .u8 opcodes for ldind and ldelem these are
	just aliases to their .i8 equivelents.
	
2004-06-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MethodPointerTypeRef.cs: New File - represents a method pointer
	that is being treated as a typeref. For example method void*() in
	the statement castclass method void*().
	
2004-06-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* InstrTable.cs: Add undocumented brnull opcode. This is really
	just an alias for brfalse.
	
2004-06-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MethodDef.cs: Add a method to create vararg signatures from a
	list of typerefs that matches the algorithm for creating vararg
	signatures from paramdefs. This is used when creating methodref
	signatures.
	* MethodRef.cs: Use the new CreateVarargSignature method to create
	the methods signature if it is a vararg method.
	
2004-06-14  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* CodeGen.cs: Implement setting module names.
	
2004-05-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* MethodDef.cs: Cache vararg signatures so a new memberref is not
	created for each vararg pattern.
	
2004-05-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* InstrTable.cs: ldc.i4.M1 is aliased to ldc.i4.m1. Fixes bug #58524.
	
2004-05-22  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* GlobalMethodRef.cs: Check for sentinel properly.

	* CodeGen.cs: Allow setting assembly info.
	
2004-04-01  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* CodeGen.cs: Add a current assembly ref and methods to create/end
	it so we can set assembly ref attributes.

	correct order.
	
2003-11-18  Jackson Harper <jackson@ximian.com>

	* LdstrInstr.cs: Allow strings to be created as bytearrays.
	
2003-10-28 Jackson Harper <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ExternTable.cs: Revert back to resolving value and class types
	into the same table. This avoids types being resolved multiple
	times when classrefs are used with valuetypes.
	
2003-10-28 Jackson Harper <jackson@ximian.com>

	* ExternTable.cs: This is now used to store ExternTypeRefs so we
	only create 1 for each external type.

	methods. Fixes bug #49614.
	
2003-10-11 Jackson Harper <jackson@ximian.com>

	* GenericTypeRef.cs: Allow Mvars to be a base type.
	* GenericMethodRef.cs: Basically just a wrapper around an existing

	* MethodDef.cs: Allow PInvoke info to be added.
	
2003-09-21 Jackson Harper <jackson@latitudegeo.com>

	* CodeGen.cs: Add methods for adding data. CodeGen now takes a
	report object for giving users errors/warnings/info.
	* FieldDef.cs: When a data constant is assigned to a field the
	constant might not exist yet. So just take the constants name and
	look it up when writting code.
	* Local.cs: Starting to add some error handling. Still playing
	with diff ways to do this.
	* MethodDef.cs: Add some error handling for local var lookups
	* TypeDef.cs: Data is allways global so it should never be added
	to a class
	* TypeRef.cs: Error message for lookups.
	
2003-09-20 Jackson Harper <jackson@latitudegeo.com>

2003-09-16 Jackson Harper <jackson@latitudegeo.com>

	* InstrTable.cs: endfault instruction (which is just endfinally
	with a costume on).
	
2003-09-15 Jackson Harper <jackson@latitudegeo.com>

	* FinallyBlock.cs: The sad thing is how long it took me to realize
	what was going on here...
		
2003-09-13 Jackson Harper <jackson@latitudegeo.com>

	* MethodInstr.cs: callvirt operation is implicitly instance.
	
2003-09-12 Jackson Harper <jackson@latitudegeo.com>

	* TypeRef.cs: Remove unused enum, this has been moved to the
	ModifiableType base class.
	
2003-09-08 Jackson Harper <jackson@latitudegeo.com>

	* TypeDef.cs: By default types will have System.Object as their
	parent type if no parent type is specified (this is what PEAPI
	does) however if we are assembling corlib the System.Object type
	will not have System.Object as its parent type.
	
2003-08-19 Jackson Harper <jackson@latitudegeo.com>

2003-08-10 Jackson Harper <jackson@latitudegeo.com>

	* CodeGen.cs: Fix tabbing
	* ModifiableType.cs: Modify a types signature when the type is

	modified immediatly because they are used in method signatures and
	would fail for overloaded operations if sigs weren't modified
	right away.
	* ExternTypeRef.cs: Add signature modifications, fix some tabbing
	* GenericTypeInst.cs: Use ModifiableType as a base
	* GenericTypeRef.cs: Use ModifiableType as a base

	define them in another loop.
	
2003-08-02 Jackson Harper <jackson@latitudegeo.com>

	* MethodDef.cs: Add methods to create labels all 3 ways, and emit
	labels created by each of the methods.

	PEFile untill the Resolve phase.
