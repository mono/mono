Managed.Windows.Forms README
$Revision: 1.2 $

* Introduction

Managed.Windows.Forms is a managed implementation of System.Windows.Forms.
It implements a driver interface to allow running on multiple windowing systems,
for example X11 or Windows. All controls are implemented in managed code,
using System.Drawing to draw them.


* Status

This library is in pre-alpha state. Development is still in the very early
stages. Bug reports are welcome, provided they don't just point out missing
classes. Please use http://bugzilla.ximian.com/


* Contributions

No contributions providing only stubs will be accepted at this time. We ask
that you submit contributions for review before committing them, our goal is 
to have a consistent and complete implementation, ideally having most or all
methods and properties of a class written by the same author. This will ensure
a certain degree of consistency in the code. Please also check the 
'Guidelines' file.


The core team for Managed.Windows.Forms currently are:
	Jordi Mas i Hernandez	(jordi@ximian.com)
	Jackson Harper		(jackson@ximian.com)
	Peter Bartok		(pbartok@novell.com)

The Mac OS/X driver implementation is currently being done by:
	Geoff Norton		(gnorton@customerdna.com)


* Mailing List

There is a mailing list dedicated to Mono's System.Windows.Forms 
implementation, mono-winforms-list, see

* To run System.Windows.Forms Applications

You should use the old Wine-based implementation until this library is
more functional and reaches beta-stage.
