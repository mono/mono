2004-11-22  Jambunathan K  <kjambunathan@novell.com>
	* Makefile: Added new make target 'consolidate-test-results'.

2004-11-22  Jambunathan K  <kjambunathan@novell.com>
	* Makefile: Run "make run-test" or "make run-test-ondotnet" to
	exercise mbas test cases.

	* testmbas: Moved the test files under this directory to Test/misc
	where it rightfully belongs.

2004-11-17  Jambunathan K  <kjambunathan@novell.com>
	* attribute.cs: Temporarily made Attribute.UnManagedType public.
	
	* class.cs: Removed the instance method
	MethodCore.LabelParameters() and moved it's functionality to the
	new instance methods Parameters.LabelParameters() and
	Parameter.DefineParameter().
	
	* parameter.cs: Introduced new instance methods
	Parameters.LabelParameters() and Parameter.DefineParameter() and
	slightly improved Parameter.ApplyAttributeBuilder().
	
2004-11-17  Jambunathan K  <kjambunathan@novell.com>
	* mb-parser.jay: During multi-file compilation, global attributes
	were not getting parsed properly. Fixed the same.
	
2004/10/22 Rafael Teixeira <rafaelteixeirabr@hotmail.com>
	* mb-parser.jay : correcting global attributes handling, because it was 
	   issuing wrong warnings for trivial files like testmbas/WriteOK.vb.
	* Makefile : adding testmbas/AssemblyInfo.vb to some test compilations 

2004-11-10  Jambunathan K  <kjambunathan@novell.com>
	* attribute.cs: 1) Replaced the static method
	Attribute.GetValidPlaces() with an equivalent instance method
	Attribute.GetValidTargets() 2) Added new methods Attributes.Emit
	() and Attribute.Emit(). 3) Migrated functionality of
	ApplyAttributes to ApplyAttributeBuilder of respective classes.

	* class.cs, decl.cs, codegen.cs, const.cs, parameter.cs :
	Implemented ApplyAttributeBuilder() in the following classes:
	TypeContainer, Constructor, Field, Property, Event, DeclSpace,
	AssemblyClass, ModuleClass, Const, Method, Parameter.
	
	* codegen.cs: Implemented Emit() in the following classes:
	AssemblyClass and ModuleClass.

	future code that is yet to come.

2004-11-09  Jambunathan K  <kjambunathan@novell.com>
	* class.cs: Coalesced the functionality of Property and

	suspect that the class will never be required in VB.NET context
	and can possibly be stripped off after careful inspection.

	* tree.cs, module.cs, interface.cs, enum.cs, delegate.cs,
	const.cs, codegen.cs: Changes necessiated by the above changes.

	the future 3) Added new accessors Attribute.IsAssemblyAttribute
	and Attribute.IsModuleAttribute

2004-11-06  Jambunathan K  <kjambunathan@novell.com>
	* rootcontext.cs: Removed the static field -
	RootContext:global_attribute.

2004-11-06  Jambunathan K  <kjambunathan@novell.com>
	* class.cs: 
	* attribute.cs: Removed the incomplete and (for now) unnecessary
	Mono.MonoBASIC.Operator class. Let us bother about this later.

	Stripping off these unused bits will help me in 1) refactoring the
	mbas Attributes related code 2) reusing the code from the mcs code
	base.
	
2004-11-06  Jambunathan K  <kjambunathan@novell.com>

2004/08/01  Rafael Teixeira <rafaelteixeirabr@hotmail.com>
	* mb-parser.jay : Some correction as pointed by Jambunathan,

	compiles fine with csc. This checkin is to workaround the mcs
	bug so that cvs builds are not broken.
