	* location.cs version 1.4 recovered (Marco Ridoni had it overwritten with an older version)

					 but we need to check if that code is lying in Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll
					 New class Erase

2003/02/22  Rafael Teixeira <rafaelteixeirabr@hotmail.com>
	* class.cs : As, per vbc, there is a rootnamespace now, --main wasn't working anymore,

				 We now also test the name passed prepended by the rootnamespace.
	* class.cs : Corrected warning "The keyword new is required on `Mono.CSharp.Property.Emit'
				 because it hides inherited member `PropertyBase.Emit'", by making it virtual
