	* Updated to NUnit 2.2.0 Final Release.

	* nunit.key: New. (Truncated) key pair used to sign nunit assemblies.

2003-10-12  Todd Berman  <tberman@gentoo.org>

	* Lots of files changed, upgraded to nunit 2.1.4. I built and ran the
	corlib test, so it seems like existing tests should still work under
	this new version of nunit.

	* makefile(s): Added `MCS' and `MCS_FLAGS' variables.

2003-01-12  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* makefile(s): Only build if source changes. Naive implementation.

	* TestResult.xml: Generated result file. Shouldn't be in CVS.

2002-12-15  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* nunit.build: Don't delete Transform.resources now, we don't generate
	it anymore.
