	* AssemblyInfo.cs: Now that bug #57941 (incomplete key pairs) is fixed
	we now use nunit.key to sign their assemblies.

	* makefile.gnu: added resource file.

2002-12-15  Nick Drochak  <ndrochak@gol.com>

	* Transform.resources: Add file.  This is technically a generated file,
	but it will never change for us since we get the sources from the nunit
	project anyway.
