TODO
====

HIGH PRIORITY
-------------

Don't generate GObjects by default, said to be too heavy. Might need to clean
up the generator to make this easier.

For GObject generation, tie in generated code with Gtk+ etc. hierarchy

Handle nested classes

Generate enums and structs

Support return values and ref/out parameters

Support more primitive types

Only install relevant headers, and use the proper subdirectory path for includes

LOW PRIORITY
------------

Delegates, events etc.

Complete GObject support including macros and GType, taking into account
inheritance etc.

generate autoconf/automake build files. set AC_VERSION using the assembly's
version attribute

Automatically generate inline API documentation using documentation in the
Monodoc format. The GTK+ API documentation generator can then be used to create
documentation familiar to GTK+ developers.

Resolve GC issues using weak references or storing objects in something like a
MonoGHashTable
