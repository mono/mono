	* NodeFormatter.cs: Change formatting of error message.
	* NodeInfo.cs: Nested types are MemberTypes.NestedType; set as
	  NodeTypes.Type so we don't get error messages under .NET.

2002-12-31  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* ConsoleTypeDisplayer.cs: New; Display reflection information to the console
	* CSharpNodeFormatter.cs: Most formatting information was moved to
	  LanguageNodeFormatter.cs (to permit sharing with the VBNodeFormatter)
	* ExplicitNodeFinder.cs: Updates due to NodeFinder changes.
	* Factories.cs: Add new "Displayer" factory, remove "Factory" from name of
	  factory objects; the fact they're in a "Factories" class should be
		sufficient.
	* IndentingTextWriter.cs: Ensure that if a string sent to Write or WriteLine
	  contains embedded newlines, that we indent the text after the newlines
		appropriately.
	* ITypeDisplayer.cs: New; Abstraction for displaying reflection information
	* LanguageNodeFormatter.cs: Massive cleanup & Consolidation of features.
	  Now works as a control class for generating Language-like output,
		simplifying C# and VB.NET language formatting.
	* Makefile: Most contents moved to `makefile.core'; just sets variables and
	  forwards operation to `makefile.core'.
	* Node.cs: Debugging ToString() implementation
	* NodeFinder.cs: Change virtual Get* methods to Add* methods, as
	  they're supposed to Add stuff to the Collection object passed as the first
		paramter, not actually return ("get") anything; Removed `maxDepth', as
		it's not used in the NodeFinder.
	* NodeFormatter.cs: Move language-like attribute formatting to
	  LanguageNodeFormatter; check that base type isn't null before accessing
		its name; recent CVS snapshots have the base object of interfaces as the
		null object (before it was System.Object); this may be a mono bug.
	* NodeInfo.cs: Debugging ToString() implementation
	* ProgramOptions.cs: Make classes public, not internal
	* README: Updates
	* ReflectionNodeFinder.cs: Updates due to NodeFinder changes.
	* TestTypes.cs: More tests
	* TypeDisplayer.cs: New; Helper implementation for ITypeDisplayer
	* TypeFactory.cs: Trace/log the exception generated when creating a new
	  object
	* TypeLoader.cs: Take a list of types to search for, not just a single type.
	  This simplifies looking for types, as we can do a single search for all
		types, instead of separate searches for each type.  Also improves
		performance.
	* TypeReflectorApp.cs: New; Formerly ConsoleOutput.cs; sets things in motion
	* TypeReflectorOptions.cs: Make public; Add --displayer argument
	* VBNodeFormatter.cs: New; Displayer reflection information in VB.NET
	* gtk: new directory for Gtk# front-end
	* makefile.core: New; Common makefile rules shared between Makefile,
	  makefile.gnu
	* makefile.gnu: New; makefile used on Linux, used by tools/makefile.gnu for
	  recursive makes.
	* type-reflector.exe.config: Add new switch, sample listener

2002-12-21  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* ConsoleOutput.cs: Use a Switch for trace messages.
	* ExplicitNodeFinder.cs: Use a Switch for trace messages.
	* GroupingNodeFinder.cs: Use a Switch for trace messages.
	* IndentingTextWriter.cs: Use a Switch for trace messages; remove copyright
	  statement.
	* NodeFinder.cs: Use a Switch for trace messages.
	* TypeLoader.cs: Use a Switch for trace messages; remove copyright
	  statement.
	* type-reflector.exe.config: default .config file (disable all trace
	  messages)

2002-12-10  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* TestTypes.cs: Use a different attribute type for [return:] attribute on 
		TestClass.PublicMethod, as mcs doesn't support [return:] attributes yet
		and it was generating an error for the two "MyAttribute" attributes.

2002-12-08  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
