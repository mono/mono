The old DBLinq code was moved into here because it supports 
sqlmetal directly and referencesource does not contain it. 

We implement Linq to SQL by integrating DBLinq effort:
http://linq.to/db 

Basically, we just copy DBLinq sources ("src" directory) into our tree,
and remove irrelevant/not-yet-supported sources.

For DBLinq documentations, check their project website and sources.

Any contributions should be sent to DBLinq project unless there is
reason to not do so.
