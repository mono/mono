TODO
for CorCompare - 2002/02/25

	* The "methods" for a property's set and get are listed in the methods
	element.  It would be cool to take them out of there and show that
	info in the property element, like "SomeProp{ get; set; } if it's missing
	both.

	* The constructors are just listed as ".ctor" which is not very verbose.
	What we really need here is the parameter list too, but I couldn't find
	a way to get the parameters for constructors, only methods.

	* Missing attributes on classes and members are not included at all.
