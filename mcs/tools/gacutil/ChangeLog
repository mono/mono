	* gacutil.cs: force = true requested by Miguel.

2004-05-17  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* gacutil.cs:
	(InstallAssembly): use Array.IndexOf to search for "/f", "-f" or
	"--force" instead of expecting it in a fixed place.

2004-05-14  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* gacutil.cs: Remove old file/symlink, thanks urs. 

2004-05-14  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* gacutil.cs: Always install the package files.
	
2004-05-04  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* gacutil.cs: We need to overwrite existing libraries if they
	already exist in the package directory on windows. Also made the
	code somewhat readable with 80 cols.

	* gacutil.cs: potential fix for miguel.

2004-05-03  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* gacutil.cs: support /package in /u now as well.

2004-05-03  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* gacutil.cs: Add /package support. Seriously going to rewrite cmdline
	handling *asap* cause this is just wrong.

2004-05-01  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* gacutil.cs: copy the config file, not the assembly again.

2004-05-01  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* gacutil.cs: ack, miguel is right, cmdline handling needs some love.

2004-04-30  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* gacutil.cs: cleanup help.

2004-04-30  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* gacutil.cs: remove /prefix, now --root and /root

2004-04-30  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* gacutil.cs: Change the way of handling the /prefix stuff.
	Now all gacbased operations will work with /prefix or --root. This
	*MUST* be at the end of the commandline for it to work.
	Also note, that in a Makefile changing /i to /u will not work, as the
	gac uninstalls based on AssemblyName.Name, so forexample:

	gacutil /i some/path/blah/System.dll --root /usr/lib/somefakegac

	will install and

	gacutil /u System --root /usr/lib/somefakegac

	will uninstall.

2004-04-30  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* gacutil.cs: Rename /prefix with /libdir,  Append mono/gac to
	that. 

2004-04-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* gacutil.cs: Install config files.
	
2004-04-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* gacutil.cs: Use invariant culture for ToLower. Patch from Urs Muff.
	
2004-04-30  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* gacutil.cs: Add a missing .Trim ()

2004-04-29  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* gacutil.cs: Allow a prefix to be specified. This is only for
	packaging if you install to some wack prefix it wont work.
	
2004-04-29  Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* gacutil.cs: return non-zero when something fails.

2004-04-29  Todd Berman  <tberman@sevenl.net>

	* gacutil.cs: Add assembly name to installation message.

2004-04-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* gacutil.cs: Temporarily disable strong name verification when
	installing.
	
2004-04-27  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* gacutil.cs: Remove hack for removing strong name headers. The
	strong name type now handles these properly and this screwed up
	the ecma key.
	
2004-03-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* gacutil.cs: Add culture to assemblies version string.
	
2003-12-10  Todd Berman  <tberman@gentoo.org>

	* gacutil.cs: Properly detect and fail gracefully on ms.net runtime
	* README:
	* TODO: Updated

2003-12-10  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* gacutil.cs: Fix binding flags.
	
	* gacutil.cs: Applied patch from Todd Berman (tbermann@gentoo.org).
	Use Environment.GacPath () instead of hardcoding the GAC path.

2003-11-16  Sebastien Pouliot  <spouliot@videotron.ca>

	* gacutil.cs: Added strongname validation
	* Makefile: Added a reference to Mono.Security assembly.

2003-11-16  Todd Berman  <tberman@gentoo.org>

	* gacutil.cs: /il functionality
	* gacutil.cs: /ul functionality
	* TODO: updated
	* gacutil.cs: help text added.

2003-11-15  Todd Berman  <tberman@gentoo.org>
	
	* gacutil.cs: Added reference counting for installation and deletion.
	An assembly will have a RefCount of 1 if --force is used.
	* gacutil.cs: Changed ... + Path.DirSepChar + ... to Path.Combine
	Thanks to Ben Maurer. Turns out code marked as potentially not
	needed was not needed, now refcounting with /u assemblyname works
	as well.
	* gacutil.cs: Incorporated uac (User Assembly Cache), needs some
	machine.config security checking as well.

2003-11-14  Todd Berman  <tberman@gentoo.org>

	* gacutil.cs: added proper removal of assemblies, now the version=
	syntax also works.
	* gacutil.exe: somehow got added, removing, duh.

2003-11-12  Todd Berman  <tberman@gentoo.org>

	* Makefile:
	* TODO:
	* README:
	* ChangeLog: 
	* gacutil.exe.sources:
	* gacutil.cs: Added
