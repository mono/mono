2008-10-16  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* mono-shlib-cop.cs: Migrate from Mono.GetOptions to Mono.Options.
	* mono-shlib-cop.exe.sources: Include Mono.Options source.

2007-05-14  Wade Berrier  <wberrier@novell.com>

	* mono-shlib-cop.exe.config: Remove "does-not-exist" dllmap
	(Was complicating packaging on ia64: There is no libc.so.6 on
	ia64, only libc.so.6.1)

2007-04-09  Raja R Harinath  <rharinath@novell.com>

	* Makefile (cleanup): Use '-f' to silence 'rm'.

2006-09-20  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@gmail.com>

	* Makefile (EXTRA_DISTFILES): Add test.cs to fix test-profiles.

2006-09-14  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Makefile: Modify test to build `test.dll' and use that as an input
	  assembly to mono-shlib-cop.exe, and not mono-shlib-cop.exe itself.  This
	  permits mono-shlib-cop.exe to be "clean", as it doesn't need to have
	  deliberate errors inserted into it for use by the unit test.
	* mono-shlib-cop.cs: Remove methods used for unit test.
	* mono-shlib-cop.exe.config: Add <dllmap/> entry for libglib-2.0, so that
	  `mono-shlib-cop mono-shlib-cop.exe` doesn't return any errors/warnings.
	  This is requested by meebey@#mono, so that mono-shlib-cop doesn't itself
	  require development libraries to execute (complicating the packaging
	  process on debian).
	* mono-shlib-cop.exe.out: Removed; not used anymore.
	* test.cs: Added; test input file for mono-shlib-cop.
	* test.dll.out: Added; expected output for `mono-shlib-cop test.dll`.

2005-09-07  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* mono-shlib-cop.cs: Use Assembly.LoadWithPartialName instead of
	  Assembly.Load(AssemblyName) for loading -r: assemblies, since this
	  actually works (though it's also deprecated in .NET 2.0, with no
	  replacement).  If the first LoadWithPartialName fails, try again after
	  removing any .dll extension (since the .dll isn't part of the assembly
	  name, but I often specify it anyway).

2005-09-07  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* mono-shlib-cop.cs: Patch from John Luke to fix use of Path.Combine (don't
	  want to use an `/'-prefixed path as the 2nd parameter) and improve XML
	  node selection.

2005-07-18  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* mono-shlib-cop.exe.config: .config file to help with testing.
	* mono-shlib-cop.exe.out: Output generated from 
	  `mono mono-shlib-cop.exe mono-shlib-cop.exe`
	* Makefile: Add support for regression tests.

2005-07-14  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* mono-shlib-cop.cs: Use RuntimeEnvironment.SystemConfigurationFile to find
	  $sysconfigdir/etc/mono/config, since $sysconfigdir might not be under 
	  $prefix (the case for RPMs: $sysconfigdir=/etc, $prefix=/usr).
	  Fixes 75287.

2005-06-06  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* mono-shlib-cop.cs: Use better default prefix handling (don't always assume
	  `/' is the prefix, instead base the choice off runtime information).

2005-06-06  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* mono-shlib-cop.cs: Rename Report to AssemblyCheckInfo.  Add -p
	  command-line option to specify mono prefixes to search for.
	  Store $prefix/etc/mono/config and ASSEMBLY.config XmlDocuments in 
	  AssemblyCheckInfo, and use AssemblyCheckInfo to search for <dllmap> 
	  entries.  This allows us to cache XmlDocuments across AppDomains (since
	  AssemblyCheckInfo is a MarshalByRefObject), and should cut down on file
	  I/O (since we don't re-read the .config for every member of every type).

2005-06-03  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* mono-shlib-cop.cs: Add MessageInfo, MessageCollection, & Report classes to
	  support message merging.  Remove AssemblyCheckResults; AssemblyChecker
	  uses Report directly to add messages.  Add .config file parsing support.
	* README: flush.
