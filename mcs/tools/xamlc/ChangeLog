	* demo/TestVocab/ConsoleApp.cs: remove default value hack, since we
	have proper default value support now

2005-07-05  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* README: updated to reflect current output of demo
	* demo/test.xaml: add attached property attribute demo

2005-07-05  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>

	* README: describe the demo as it currently is
	* demo/TestVocab/ConsoleWriter.cs: delegates demonstration
	* demo/TestVocab/ConsoleApp.cs: events demonstration
	* demo/test.xaml: include delegates and events in demonstration

2005-07-03  Iain McCoy  <iain@mccoy.id.au>
	* demo/Makefile: made more useful - just do "make run" and it should
	all happen
	* demo/test.xaml: added Code section, which I think should make this
	thing a complete, if small, program
	* demo/TestVocab/*: some small bugfixes, with a little bit of
	craziness to work around the slightly bogus stuff in DependencyObject
	at the moment.

	* whole folder: first emphatically work-in-progress version of xaml
	compiler
