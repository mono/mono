	* repl.cs (RunRepl): Catch exceptions, and send those as errors
	back to the client.

	* repl.cs: Rename AttachedCSharpShell to ClientCSharpShell.

	Make most of the CSharpShell code into instance code, so that we
	can override the behavior on ClientCSharpShell and reuse most of
	the logic there.

	CSharpShell now has a virtual `Evaluate' that is used to implement
	the evaluator. 

	Implemented a new more robust protocol for sending the information
	back and forth.

	Now the results are show on the client, and come prettyprinted.
