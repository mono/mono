* This is BMCS

	Last merge to GMCS: 41320

	BMCS is a new fork of the generics compiler from revision
	38733 (11th of January 2005).  

	This new compiler is based on the changes that Jambunathan did
	to mcs from November 30th, 2004 to integrate the existing mbas
	compiler with a more recent mcs.

	We have ported those changes to use `gmcs' so that we get
	support for generics into our VB compiler eventually.

	Work toward integrating the improvements from mbas will go here.

* LICENSING

	Notice that the compiler might eventually need to go into the
	class libraries.  We request that contributors grant us permission	
	to relicense the code under the MIT X11 license if we have to.
