This contains the C# components of the Mono project.

	* Compilers written in C#

	* Class Libraries.

	* Regression Test Suites

To install this source code, look at the INSTALL file in the `mono'
package module which drives the compilation of this directory.

* Layout
========

	build/
		Rules, configuration and makefile components to build
		this module.

	class/
		The class libraries.

	docs/
		Some notes on the compiler and the class libraries.

	errors/
		Sample programs that should generate errors by the C# compiler.

	ilasm/
		The IL assembler.

	jay/
		Yacc-based parser generator.

	mcs/
		The Mono C# compiler

	packages/
		Integrates some packages from NuGet (like Roslyn) into the build system.

	tests/
		Regression test suite for the C# compiler

	tools/
		Various small development tools: CorCompare used to compare
		two assemblies for differences in the API; csharp is a C# REPL;
		cil-strip trims IL from assemblies.

* Building Individual Directories
=================================

You can build individual components in the hierarchy by running the command
"make", and to install it use "make install".

By default, the 4.x profile is built, if you want to build other profiles,
use the following command:

	make PROFILE=<profilename>

And to install:

	make PROFILE=<profilename> install

To turn on verbose mode in the build (for example to diagnose a
problem), you can use the V=1 flag, like this:

	make V=1

* Running Unit tests
====================

You can run unit tests in individual components by running the command:

	make run-test

If you want to only run the tests in a single fixture (say
'MonoTests.System.TypeTest'), you can use

	make run-test TEST_FIXTURE=System.TypeTest

* Acknowledgements
==================

Thanks a lot to Sergey Chaban for his help during the development of
the C# compiler.
