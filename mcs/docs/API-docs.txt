This file contains a list of things which are unclear, confusing or
simply wrong in the microsoft docs. We keep a list of such things
here so that we can show them to the Microsoft people later on to
help them fix their documentation and class libraries.

* BitConverter.To*():
  The docs say it should be ArgumentOutOfRangeException in the case
  where "startIndex is less than zero or greater than the length of value 
  minus 2.", but the mscorlib throws an ArgumentException.

* Guid.Guid(string) ctor:
  The documentation says this ctor accepts (amongst others) the format
  "{0xdddddddd,0xdddd,0xdddd,{0xdd},{0xdd},{0xdd},{0xdd},{0xdd},{0xdd},
  {0xdd},{0xdd}}". As implemented in mscorlib, however, it accepts:
  "{0xdddddddd,0xdddd,0xdddd,{0xdd,0xdd,0xdd,0xdd,0xdd,0xdd,0xdd,0xdd}.

* Guid.ToString(string format):
  The documentation specifies that if the format is the empty string or
  null, this is equivalant to a format "N". In mscorlib, the format "D"
  is taken here.

* String.Compare (String, Int32, String, Int32, Int32):

  The documentation is a bit confusing.

  In the "Remarks" section it says

  >> The number of characters compared is the lesser of the length of
     strA less indexA, the length of strB less indexB, and length.

  In the "Exception" section it says a condition for the
  ArgumentOutOfRangeException

  >> The sum of indexA and length is greater than strA. Length. 
  >> -or-
  >> The sum of indexB and length is greater than strB. Length.
  >> -or-
  >> indexA, indexB, or length is negative.

  The latter implies that Compare ("ab", 0, "abcdef", 0, 3) will
  throw an exception - but the "Remarks" section implies that it will
  not. Both mscorlib.dll and our class libraries behave according to
  the "Remarks" section.
