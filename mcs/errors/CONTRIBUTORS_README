Mono MCS Errors.

	Errors in the Mono C# compiler use the same codes as the
	Microsoft C# compiler, the listing of the errors on it lives
	in:

	http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cscomp/html/vctbsCompilerErrorsSC0001ThroughSC9999.asp

* Format

	Error tests are stored in files with the format:

		csXXXX.cs 	for the first error.
		csXXXX-2.cs 	for the second way to trigger the error.
		csXXXX-n.cs	for subsequent ways of triggering the error. 
	
	The file should start with two inline commented lines.
	The first one contains a little description of the error, 
	the second line declares the line where the error occurs.

	You should not copy Microsoft's examples or documentation
	text.  You will need to write your own.
	
	For example:

	// cs0057.cs: Inconsistent accessibility. Parameter type is less accessible than operator.
	// Line: 10

	There should not be more than one error per tests.  Each test
	should only contain one error.

	Then you have to add the file to the CVS and commit it.

	The next thing is to write a short text file with a little
	description of what the error is and what it's necessary
	to be done to solve it. 
        
* Compiler options

        If you need to run error test with some special option(s),
        use following syntax in your error test file.
        
        // cs0193.cs: * or -> operator can only be applied to pointer types.
        // Line: 9
        // Compiler options: -unsafe        

* Dependencies

        In case that your error test depends on the library or other C# file.
        Create separate file with same name as your error test name except
        first two letters which are uppercased. And then add this file to
        Makefile.
