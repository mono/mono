# These files are give the wrong warning when compiled.
# If you add a new test that should generate an error but generates the
# wrong one, it should be added here.

# If you fix the compiler so that it emits the correct error,
# the file should be removed.

# This file supports extended syntax
# csXXXX.cs		: error test case reports wrong error
# csXXXX.cs IGNORE 	: adds test to ignore list (should ONLY be used if the runtime crashes)
# csXXXX.cs NO ERROR	: error test case doesn't report any error. An exception is considered
#			  as NO ERROR and CS5001 is automatically ignored.
